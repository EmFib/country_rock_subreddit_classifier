0,"Do you ever feel like intellectually you’re not quite running at 100%? ... like there are untapped depths within your mind that you can’t access? Here’s a crazy story —

Ever heard of Natan Sharansky?

He was thrown into solitary confinement in the Soviet Union for years with nothing but his wits. No table. No light. No TikTok. No nuthin’.

But he kept himself sane. In fact, he said he came out of prison more mentally robust than he went in! How, you ask? By playing chess...in his mind.

Must be hard to remember every specific piece on the board, right? Well Natan Sharansky played not one... not two... not three games simultaneously. He played *seven* simultaneous games of chess in his mind, sitting in his underwear in a windowless cell in Siberia. But, that’s not the craziest part... 

He then went on to beat the world chess champion in Israel after he was released.

Pretty mad, huh. Do you think you’d be able to accomplish something similar? 

Let me ask you this.

Where does your mind go when there are no distractions? Do you get more insightful when you spend time alone with your mind?

Here’s another mad prison-related story —

Charlie Plumb, a prisoner of war in Vietnam, managed to catalogue his entire existence from his earliest memory (at 3 years old) until the day of his imprisonment.

He could remember every book, every kid in his class, every lunch he had eaten, every movie he had ever watched, every word to every song, every girl he had kissed...just from spending a lot of time thinking about it.

If I asked you what you had for dinner 3 nights ago… would you remember? Personally it would take me a while. Now, what about 3,000 nights ago?

How would your life benefit, do you think, from having the clarity of thought that Natan and Charlie have?

If true clarity of thought comes from spending lots of time just thinking about stuff, then answer this for me...

How much of *your* life is spent listening to other people’s ideas vs creating your own ideas from scratch? 

How often do you watch TV or listen to podcasts or read the news?

If some people have gained ***sooo*** much from being stripped of input for years...could you recreate that in your own life (without the kidnapping and torture)?

I mean we were all reduced to fewer inputs over the last few months. And what happened? We got bored, yep. But, we also got creative. We also got productive.

A lot of people are coming out of lockdown more mentally and physically healthy than ever. You might be one of them. This is because, in my opinion, we all had fewer inputs in our life which gave us more time to really *think*.

So, what do you think you’re capable of if you really spent time thinking about it? 

Could you memorise an entire book? Could you create an imagined world and populate it with complex characters? Could you mentally map out the next 20 years of your career?

Do you ever just sit and daydream about that kind of stuff while looking out the window for twenty minutes? Or, close your eyes and consciously explore your mind? Or, write a stream of consciousness diary?

If not, why not? Do you drown out your own thoughts with background music or TV or something else?

The thing is — the better you get at sitting and doing nothing, the better you get at doing anything.

It’s the secret to being funny, the secret to never running out of things to say, the secret to having original ideas, the secret to providing value in a work setting, the secret to being charismatic…

It’s worth focusing some energy on."

I never saw her death as an actual possibility (she was the so young, beautiful and thriving with passion and life) yet I was riddled with an intensity of fear, anxiety, and stress I cannot express in words. After her passing I quit everything and began traveling the world; volunteering, experiencing new cultures, healing, soul searching, learning, meditating, and just living life. She passed in 2014 and since then has helped guide me to a place of healing and truth... one of mindful compassion and self-love. It's just so crazy looking back upon it all... like I'm trying to recall a bedtime tale I was told as a child instead of a life I experienced and lived. Very surreal, very beautiful too.

0,"If there's a ""to-do"" on my list for awhile, it's often because I haven't identified the very first concrete step I need to take to get it done. "
0,"If you're experiencing a wave of negative emotion; stress, depression, anger, or anxiety... learning how to Center is a tremendous tool. Here are 5 steps I've outlined. I call it Centering because we take a mental and sensory inventory of our current environment and Centering ourselves within that precise moment.

Step 1 - Safety: Get yourself to a safe place of comfort and security.

Step 2 - Breathwork: Begin focusing on breath, walking yourself through a breathing exercise while counting, (5 seconds inhale, hold 5 seconds, exhale 5, hold 5 - then repeat). Try and breathe with your diaphragm and take an account of the movement of air going in and out of your lungs and watching your belly ebb.

Step 3 - Sensory Inventory: While doing this, try and perceive your immediate surroundings in as much detail as possible. Think of it this way, you will have five/ten minutes to try and remember as much detail as you can of your current place, (car, bedroom, bathroom, office, outside (which is the best))

\-Try to visually see everything as much as possible, what are the tones of the colors, the depth of detail in a texture, the shape of everything, the devil in the detail if you will.

\-Sense or physically feel everything too, the breath fluting in and out of your nostrils, is it warm or cold, is there a breeze, or some sun warming your shoulders, or an energy in the room?

\-Any smells or aromas, the sea, a forest, a lingering candle scent, food, a pet, dirty clothing - it doesn't matter what it is, good or bad, you're merely taking an account of it like doing inventory. You don't care what you're counting, you're just counting.

\-Hearing, this is my personal favorite. Find and listen to, attend Everything. Bird song, critters outside, the washer/dryer, people's chatter in the distant or muffled convo beyond a wall, a pet breathing, the wind rustling the leaves of a tree, traffic. Like sonar, take your attention to each sound as it resonates with you.

\-Taste won't usually be too helpful here so concentrate on the other senses.

Step 4 - Mantra: Mentally or out loud repeat a mantra or prayer which resonates with you. Repeat this as you continue with the previous steps, replacing the counting with a mantra. I like;

""I am safe, secure, and loved."" or ""My breath is steady, my mind is clear and settled, my body is calm, my heart is pure, I am tranquil, safe, and loved.""

Step 5 - Memory Recall or Visualization: Recall a special memory of yours, one in which you felt safe, loved and had fun or it. Try recalling all the exacting detail as well as you're able; where you were, who if anyone you were with, how you felt (this is vital), the scenery or environment, etc. Some of us cannot do this however because the anxiety is too much, so I lean on a visualization technique instead. I recommend speaking out loud here as it will help your mind step away from the dreadful thoughts as it's tasked with speaking out loud. Paint the most perfect place to be, beachside villa or stroll or a forest sanctuary is great too. Walk yourself through the experience; the palms or pines and how they sway, barefoot walking on warm sand or cool earth, the forest canopy and the sun breaking through it and warming you, or big puffy white clouds sailing over the ocean, the sound of a stream or the ocean tide, the smell of sea water of the fresh air of the forest, etc. Paint out this place but as you do sprinkle statements such as, ""I feel so safe and loved here,"" or ""This place is my sanctuary, I feel free and my mind and body is serene,"" or ""I am loved, and I am love.""

Hope this helps, I suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and the most torturous state of grief after the passing of my wife in 2014 but through a choice to live in a different way and do whatever was necessary to end my suffering. I was able to rise above it and now live a life of abundance, peace, manifestation, and love again. I teach this now to others and have dozens of videos explaining all the steps and I have some fun too trying to make people laugh.

I have a couple videos based solely on stress and anxiety which detail out what I've shared above in greater depth with a much better explanation and visuals. DM me if you'd like the link or check out my page and go from there.

There is hope for you and your struggle... there is a place, a version of you which is out there waiting for you two to merge. this future version is a person who smiles in public and it's authentic. This person laughs too, and doesn't have angst while going out in public, or speaking to another, or dread anything whatsoever. This person is confident, and secure with themselves, even proud and in love. This person helps others navigate their anxiety too!

Please lmk if you have any questions and my heart goes out to you all.

Now free until October 4th on Amazon Kindle:  
[https://viewbook.at/TheMasterMind](https://viewbook.at/TheMasterMind)

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6zm6wi3sxpq51.jpg?width=246&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df9e075b85bf21af71646dd470ea1fe8abdf12bb

Enlightenment!—You may spend your whole life seeking it, but never find it. You may never search for it or even know that it’s possible, but reach it by accident. And you may live out your life ignorant of its existence, and die having never discovered your highest potential for happiness, self-mastery, and creative brilliance.  


The enlightened psychologist Abraham Maslow was the first to scientifically describe the fully enlightened person—which he called the “self-actualizing person.” Building on Maslow’s work through careful biographical study of the lives of self-actualizing people, humanistic psychologist and biographer Roman Gelperin found their enlightenment to stem from a nearly-identical handful of breakthrough experiences, which he will reveal to you in this book.

Partly a firsthand account of the author’s own accidental enlightenment, and partly a full biography of Abraham Maslow’s rise to self-actualization, this book will teach you how to identify, understand, and attain those key experiences of:

* Unlocking the perennial method of using your mind to its fullest potential
* Being fully at peace with yourself, by deconstructing your internal conflicts
* Deriving a near-constant joy, pleasure, and satisfaction from sheer existence
* Half-creating, half-discovering your driving passion and unique purpose in life
* Automatically evolving the self-actualizing qualities of total honesty, supreme self-confidence, natural creativity, effortless spontaneity, and independent thinking

By the end of this book, you will thoroughly understand what enlightenment is, how and why it occurs, and the ways to pursue it!"

0,"3 reasons why most people procrastinate depending on your personality type. Which one are you? I interviewed a productivity expert recently (Cristina Roman) and she  talks about how there are 3 different feelings that cause most people to procrastinate depending on their personality type:

1. \*\*Potential Seeker\*\*: this person is a perfectionist and worried that people might find them out.
2. \*\*Impact Seeker\*\*: this person spends a lot of time overwhelmed, trying to do everything but struggling to manage it all.
3. \*\*Enjoyment Seeker\*\*: this person is worried they will get bored.

I most associate with 3.

0,"Where are all the productivity Addicts? Am I alone? So I'm 47 and I've spent most of my 20's and 30's not reaching goals, mainly through lack of vision and also having self-destructive habits, which have demolished any chance of progress.

**I've since ""woken up""** and have removed myself from 'self-destructive habits', which has made life a lot easier and have since actually started completing goals, even exceeding them.

However, 100% of my friendship/acquaintances circle contains people who ""just do enough"" and 'clock watch' at work and have almost no goals/visions to do anything.

I am not being condescending here - as I was ""that guy"" for years - and would never turn my back on friendship/acquaintances if I was to miraculously become a millionaire CEO, as I feel there are always benefits having a mixed variety of friends and I do not judge anybody, especially considering the past i have had.

**But I'm left feeling alone** and feeling a ""mug"", being the only person actually trying all day, every day to progress in life - and when I view my friends I see pictures of coffee shops, leisure and nothing that contains any sacrifice.

I have even had some people send me pictures of these 'leisure times', knowing that I am working hard, just to remind me that they think I am wasting my time. However, I would rather have a dream and go for it than become 70-something and regret not trying.

I recently graduated from Uni this month and looking to get a career in a new field, and combine it with some niche knowledge that I have. So my dream is a realistic one that can come true, with a bit of visualisation- productivity .... and ultimately luck as the icing on the cake!

&amp;#x200B;

***When preparation meets opportunity = luck, is the mantra I'm trying to focus on.***

&amp;#x200B;

I made a ten year plan 4.5 months ago and have documented everyday. I am more optimistic now - than I was on day 1. It has been the best thing I've ever done.

&amp;#x200B;

But I feel I need to network/speak to other people out there grinding it out every day, when they do not have to! Because I have no one to relate to at the moment -

***Has anyone else ever experienced these feelings?***"
0,"Digital Checklists for a Zen Productivity &amp; Self-Care Plan  Most productivity tips and self-care tips online are counterintuitive. They don't promote happiness and are more of hard-to-achieve goals than friendly suggestions.

This [*article*](https://www.process.st/self-care-plan/) is probably the only source of productivity and self-care tips I find to be truly effective and based on happiness. They aren't just tips, too.

They are processes with steps outlined as checklists. I've been taking these suggestions for a week now.

I feel more well-rested despite being three times more productive than before. ***Here are the checklists I used and their key benefits***:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Daily self-care checklist**

This is the primary self-care checklist that will guide you through the rest of the steps. It's basically a morning to night wellness assessment.

You'll have 10 post-work wellness aspects to assess in this [*template*](https://www.process.st/checklist/daily-self-care-checklist/). Once you've evaluated your status, you'll have a better idea in navigating your self-care and productivity plan.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Annual self-care planner**

What I love about this [*template*](https://www.process.st/checklist/annual-self-care-planner/) is that it is like any yearly planner, only it's in a checklist form. It enables you to track your progress per week.

It's exciting to find out the results at the end of the year. I wish I had started this in January!

&amp;#x200B;

* **Morning routine checklist**

I thought morning routines were supposed to be long and exhausting. This [*checklist*](https://www.process.st/checklist/morning-routine-checklist/) only has 6 impactful steps.

Starting my day with this routine has totally improved my moods and productivity.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Evening routine checklist**

At first I thought this [*checklist*](https://www.process.st/checklist/evening-routine-checklist/) was just another set of steps to follow. It's actually a nice hack to making your evenings relaxing.

It's thought me to end my day with genuine fulfillment. I'm no longer worried about the things I have to do the next day as the evening comes.

Instead, I've grown to become more excited to wake up in the morning and start working.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Work checklists**

Work-life balance is the most important aspect of working that keeps us productive, healthy, and happy. This work-life balance [*checklist*](https://www.process.st/checklist/achieving-work-life-balance/) has all the necessary and straightforward steps in achieving that state.

I've also taken this [*checklist*](https://www.process.st/checklist/work-anxiety/) for overcoming work anxiety. So far, I've been feeling like I'm accomplishing more with less work hours and more time to decompress.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Health &amp; fitness**

A healthy diet is an essential aspect of self-care and our overall well-being. Copying others' meal plans online isn't helpful at all.

So this [*weekly meal planner*](https://www.process.st/checklist/weekly-meal-planner/) guides you to make your own instead. You can test and track your existing meal plans and compare them with the samples provided on the checklist.

It's hard to maintain regular exercise, especially these days when quarantine is in place. This [*fitness planner*](https://www.process.st/checklist/fitness-planner/) provides simple but achievable routines.

You can also build your own weekly routine in the same checklist. Then you'll have a weekly training tracker to help you with your progress.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Personality tests**

Personality tests can give you a huge insight into what you really need to be productive, happy, and well. This [*Big 5 Personality Structure template*](https://www.process.st/checklist/big-five-personality-test-structure-template/) has 50 questions that will assess your teamwork and individual skills.

Then there's this [*DISC Assessment Structure template*](https://www.process.st/checklist/disc-assessment-structure-template/) that will evaluate your Dominance, Influence, Compliance, and Steadiness. It can help you understand your behavior so you know whether the routines you're building are right for you or not.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Budgeting**

Most of the time, it's our finances that cause the most of our worries. I've installed different budgeting apps before, but they never worked.

Checklists actually work better. Start with this [*budget template*](https://www.process.st/checklist/budget-template/) to assess your current situation and the right solution for it.

Then move on to this [*daily budget template*](https://www.process.st/checklist/daily-budget-template/) to streamline our finances, manage your expenses, and save more.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Daily Schedule**

Your self-care, morning, and evening routine checklists are all made to be trackable. However, it's still easy to miss some days when you don't have a solid daily schedule.

You can integrate those routines in this [*daily schedule checklist*](https://www.process.st/checklist/daily-schedule-template/). It's a general structure of your routines.

Then there's this [*daily routine checklist*](https://www.process.st/checklist/daily-routine-checklist/) that'll help you with your pre-work to post-work activities.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Self-empowerment**

Self-care is not just about routines, eating well, and working out. It's also about identifying your goals and overcoming your fears and self-esteem issues.

I tried this [*overcoming negative self-talk checklist*](https://www.process.st/checklist/lisa-a-romano-overcoming-negative-self-talk/) based on Lisa A. Romano's guide. It's effective in tuning your mental clarity.

Once you've achieved the clarity you need, proceed with this [*self-evaluation checklist*](https://www.process.st/checklist/self-evaluation/) to determine your goals. Then run this [*SMART Goal setting checklist*](https://www.process.st/checklist/smart-goal-setting-checklist/) to assess how they can be achieved.

There's also this bonus [*Konmari checklist*](https://www.process.st/checklist/konmari-checklist/) for decluttering your home Marie Kondo style. I wasn't into this at first, but it's given me more clarity in setting and achieving my goal.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Outdoor activities**

Lastly, don't underestimate the power of being out in the nature. Here are three outdoor activities that can contribute to your well-being:

* *Backpacking*: This is more than just about exploring different places. It's about just packing what you need and being able to move freely with just that.

This [*backpacking checklist*](https://www.process.st/checklist/backpacking-checklist/) walks you through that essence by outlining the step-by-step process of preparing for it.

The same goes for this [*camping checklist*](https://www.process.st/checklist/camping-checklist/) and general [*travel checklist*](https://www.process.st/checklist/travel-checklist/).

Instead of copying pre-decided ""Zen self-care and productivity structures"", let these templates help you build your own, as in one that works for your personal needs."

I can barely mind my breath while sitting in the dark with the shades drawn and ear beds in which turn my office into a (very) poor man's sensory deprivation chamber. Then my frenchy walks in, and my whole day is shot. So in an effort to fuck all that I bought a door stop, blinders and a KEEP OUT I'm Meditating sign since my sock on the knob is taken by self-love or with third parties.

Unfortunately, this means social media goes too. So before parting to turn my 20 year bhikkhu career into something meaningful (not just a goddamn pipe dream where other things continually come first), I'm polling for some help. In an effort to foster consistent single object awareness outside of sitting meditation, I've covered my tummy in Ben Gay, super glued air pistol BBs to my gut (don't knock it til you try it) and impaled myself with (cauterized) thumbtacks covered with duct tape. And every damn time my wife gets home or the frenchy looks cute or my dad calls or I'm coding an app or my member looks longingly up with glee, my attention wanes.

My question is, how do you maintain constant and consistent attention on your breath throughout the days' activities?

Thank you in advance,

0,"Marcus Aurelius Once Said “I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others.” - If you are not putting yourself first in life, you are no better than a sheep :( # The Happy Life

What must you have in order to deem your life a success?

Is it a mansion in the Hollywood Hills filled with Instagram models?

Maybe you need a Ph.D in Chemistry framed on your wall?

Perhaps you want to be a high-powered executive? 

When I ask people this question, I get answers about material possessions, status symbols and prestigious accomplishments. 

Would these things make you happy?

I often wondered why many people who have everything (cars, money, girls and status) still look miserable.

The answer came to me through something called ‘hedonic-adaptation’.

In terms of material possessions and status symbols, our brains can never get enough (you can thank the neurotransmitter dopamine for this). 

Have you ever wanted something really badly?

It might have been a car, an Xbox, a trip to Bali, or maybe a new job title. 

When you got the thing you were excited and thrilled. 

But eventually, the experience became normalized and you found yourself looking for a new shiny object to complete you.

Your whole life this cycle keeps repeating, and yet you still tell yourself that the next goal will be the final conquest.

Many successful people become depressed because they reach the summit only to realize it’s the same old story. 

Why else would they need to buy 12 cars and 5 mansions? With nowhere else to go some of these people choose to exit the game via suicide or acts of debauchery.

But what if you lived your life differently?

What if instead of focusing only on the outside world you paid attention to living in accordance to your virtues. 

Here is how it works.

You create your own metrics by which you live such as:

• I’m a loyal friend.

• I’m patient with people.

• I’m a respectful son.

• I’m a creator and entrepreneur.

• I help other people realize their potential. 

• I don’t sell my integrity for money.

And every day you judge yourself based on how true you were to your standards. 

Society will never tell you true happiness is not a product of worldly success, 

because they wouldn’t be able to take your money if you knew the truth. 

True happiness comes from congruence between your actions and personal values.

We feel bad when we lie to people (unless we are sociopaths) because we are not being coherent with our values. 

We feel bad when there is a disconnect between what we are doing and what our gut is telling us to do. 

Many people never sit down and create their own metrics for a successful life. 

Instead, they allow society and savvy marketers to tell them how they should be feeling.

I see it all the time from my coaching students.

There is an emptiness in their lives because they never took control.

It’s not too late to regain control. 

Start today. This is a new way to live. 

Cheers,

Isaac

P.S.There is nothing wrong with wanting to accomplish great things (I’m all for it), just know why you want those things. Don’t do things just because other sheep are doing them.

0,"Awe: A Short Guide to A Misunderstood State of Mind Awe doesn’t seem to get mentioned much on /r/zenhabits and it’s such a wonderful emotion and state of consciousness that it deserves a post!

I had a notable recent experience during a mindful eating meditation which left me feeling euphoric. Unfortunately, awe is a state of mind we lose as we age for no other reason than we stop paying attention and stop being curious. We fall into routines and fail to see the beauty in what we label ‘mundane’. I remember vividly as a kid learning about the world and being in-awe when new information shook my foundations. How much harder life becomes when we don’t allow ourselves the opportunity for awe.

**What is awe?**

* We’ve all felt awe in our lifetimes. Stunned and silent, standing on a mountainside gazing across a valley to snow peaked caps, it dawns on us just how big the world is (or how small we are). 
* Another more nuanced experience would be witnessing someone complete an heroic act of selflessness, like a firefighter running into a burning building to save a stranger’s life. “Wow, what a hero!”.
* Two requirements are necessary for reaching a true awe state. (And I'm not talking about the overused term awesome). 
* Firstly, perceived vastness. This is met when we recognise something much larger than ourselves. Studies suggest this can be either physical size (e.g. a mountain) or symbolic (e.g. heroic firefighter).
* Secondly, a need for accommodation. There is a requirement for this realisation to alter our worldview, a remapping of our understanding of reality.

**Psychological effects**

* There are a number of physiological and psychological effects. I’ll just focus on the psychological benefits.
* Small self &amp; Humility – people often report feeling smaller after experiencing awe (due to perceived vastness). In a study where participants were experimentally induced into an awe state, participants “presented a more balanced view of their strengths and weaknesses to others and acknowledged the contribution of outside forces”. Additionally, people higher in dispositional awe were rated more humble by their friends. 
* Cognitive accommodation – awe states lead people to think more critically about information and are less persuadable by weak arguments. (And gosh don’t we need more of that right now). Plus, people that regularly experience awe states have a lower need for cognitive closure on concepts, they are more comfortable with nuance and operating in the grey zone.
* Perception of time – we all lead busy lives without a second for ourselves. Whilst awe doesn’t help give you back time :) it at least prevents one feeling so time restricted.
* Interconnectedness – After experiencing awe states people report feeling higher levels of interconnectedness. Perhaps due to perceived vastness one recognises one cannot be separate from what they are witnessing. Furthermore, there are a number of second order positive effects created from feeling interconnected.
* Positive mood &amp; Well-being – a virtual reality experience viewing high, snowy mountains induced high levels of awe and increased people’s mood.  

**Awe comes in flavours**

* Researchers believe not all awe is created equal. Different triggers will elicit different types of awe.
* Ability-based awe – great respect for another’s talents e.g. an athlete or musician.
* Virtue-based awe – witnessing acts of selflessness or immense virtue e.g. 
* Beauty-based awe – stunned by beauty e.g. work of art, natural scene or a person.
* Supernatural causality-based awe – an unknown cause considered glorious or terrifying e.g. ghosts or angels.
* Threat-based awe – flavoured by fear e.g. tornado, lightning storm or dangerous leader.
* The jury is still out whether all flavours of awe create all the same benefits.

**Your experiences**

* As parts of the world emerge from coronavirus lockdown, after weeks trapped inside, we’re now noticing parts of our world that we previously took for granted. This is a wonderful opportunity to remember.
* What moments of awe have you experienced lately?

0,"The risks of being mindless Hi everyone. I recently finished Ellen Langer's excellent book Mindfulness so wrote up some notes on being mindless. Would love your thoughts.

**TLDR; Risks of being mindless**

* Mindlessness is the opposite to mindfulness
* Humans are excellent at pattern matching. We label and categorise to avoid wasting mental energy on situations we have previously met. Mindlessness is when the mind depends heavily on past categories which fail to recognise the distinctions of the present situation.
* A narrow self image reduces our resilience. If we self-identify with a small number of high level categories our feeling of self may be threatened when these categories are in jeopardy.
* Our ethics are connected to categories. By mindlessly adopting categories we may not consider all the effects of our choice-making. E.g. a cat and a cow are both animals. But one we consider livestock which is acceptable for eating.
* Discrimination is mindless. Langer suggests reducing the categories of people to 'humans' isn't effective for combating discrimination. Instead we should mindfully increase the categories so we can find common ground. E.g. American man and Chinese man are both golfers. Changing the frame to golfing provides a bridge for deeper connection and empathy.
* We may seek fewer solutions to problems we face if we mindlessly categorise those problems.
* Aging != Sickness. By mindlessly associating aging and sickness we unburden the elderly of responsibility prematurely despite their capabilities and perhaps to their cost.
* To avoid mindlessness...
   * Focus on process (not outcomes) – focusing on outcomes sets us for negative emotions (e.g. only achieving happiness when the outcome is met). Enjoying the process keeps up flexible.
   * Maintain an open mind – information 'forms' us. Holding onto categories prevents us from reforming.
   * Controlling the context – reframing the context from harmful ones to pleasant growth oriented ones helps our mental health e.g. being lockdown at home.

0,"[Book summary] Methods of Persuasion - Nick Kolenda  Do you wish you had a step-by-step process for influencing people?

Maybe you want to drive more sales for your business or get your kids to eat their vegetables?

In the book ""**Methods of persuasion**"" by **Nick Kolenda**, he described this as a 7 step process, which can be remembered by the acronym ""**Methods**"":

&amp;#x200B;

1. **M**old their perception
2. **E**licit congruent attitudes
3. **T**rigger social pressure
4. **H**abituate your message
5. **O**ptimize your message
6. **D**rive their momentum
7. **S**ustain their compliance

The first 4 steps should be taken before your request, step 5 and 6 is for the request itself, while step 7 is to keep them doing the desired behavior.

So let's get into more detail...

# Step 1: Mold their perception:

Before your request, you'll want to change the lens through which your target sees the world. This can be done in 4 ways:

1: Priming: Did you know that mentioning words related to being old caused the participants in one study to walk slower when leaving the study? Or that showing a picture of a library made students quieter in another study? This works because knowledge is organized in semantic networks, and activating one node, will trigger related nodes.

2: Anchoring: How likely are you to share this video? More or less than 90%?...

If your range for sharing this video was 40-60%, then you likely thought 90% was too much adjusted down to your upper bound of 60%.

If I instead had asked whether it was less than 10% than you would have moved up to your lower bound of 40%

3: Convey high expectations: This is like anchoring, but just applied to expectations

4: The contrast effect: Can you share this post with 50 people? Oh... you don't want to?... Can you at least upvote then?

Applying contrast in this way can make one option appear better because it's seen compared to a worse option!

# Step 2: Elicit congruent attitudes:

When people's behavior and attitude don't match up they experience cognitive dissonance.

So when you want to ask your friend for $100, then start by asking ""Hey, do you mind sparing $10?"", when he says ""yes of course!"" he will get the attitude of being someone who helps you, because that's what his behavior reflected, and he doesn't want cognitive dissonance.

If you then ask: ""Hey, do you mind sparring another 100$?"" then your friend will want to stay congruent with his new attitude of being someone who helps you!

# Step 3: Trigger social pressure:

Here you can use all your social persuasion techniques.

Offer them a gum, and they'll want to return the favor, because of the social norm of reciprocity.

Reveal any similarities between you and your target to build rapport. Even better if the similarity is uncommon, like if you discover you both are huge fans of the children's show ""My little pony""!

Mirroring their body language, WITHOUT them noticing that you are consciously doing it, can also be a great way to build rapport.

And lastly, since most people want to follow social norms, you could take advantage of this. If you are a busking musician on the street, then putting some money in your hat before you start, will make it seem like the norm is to offer you money.

# Step 4: Habituate your message:

Which image do you think you would prefer? An image of what you look like in the mirror, or an image of the way your friends see you?

The mere-exposure effect says that people tend to develop a preference for things they encounter often. Therefore, it's the most likely that you prefer the way you look in the mirror, while your friends prefer to see you the way they always see you.

Take advantage of this by exposing your target to the topic of your request often. If you want to go traveling with your husband, then weeks before asking him you could leave travel brochures around the house and talk about the other times you've been traveling.

# Step 5: Optimize your message:

The previous 4 steps were all for preparing and now you can finally make your request!

Keep in mind that after you've made this request, they'll either evaluate it systematically or mindlessly and you'll need to present your request accordingly.

If they evaluate your request systematically they are more convinced by your arguments.

Tell all your best arguments at first and last, because that's what they'll remember the best, but also mention some negative things in the middle to make it more realistic.

If they evaluate your request mindlessly, they are more convinced by other things like aesthetics and the amount of information. If you are making a mindless decision about which toothpaste to buy, then you are more likely to buy the one that lists many benefits and are aesthetically appealing. Setting a time constraint or asking people when they are in a good mood can make them more likely to choose in this way.

# Step 6: Drive their momentum

This step is for sparking some motivation after you've made your request.

Imagine you helped your friend move into his new house and he offers you 10$. How would you feel? Now imagine instead that you received a bottle of wine that you would both be sharing.

In most cases, social incentives like buying a bottle of wine or giving praise are more powerful, because giving money is more likely to shift intrinsic motivation to external motivation.

# Step 7: Sustain their compliance

If you want your kids to eat vegetables, then you probably don't want it to be a one-time event.

To sustain their compliance you could make favorable associations by always playing their favorite songs in the background while they are eating their vegetables.

it REALLY REALLY REALLY SUCKS TO HAVE **BRAIN FOG**...

There are many **possible causes**...

&amp;#x200B;

* Stress
* Medical conditions
* Medication
* Hormonal changes
* Lack of sleep

but if you always feel brain fog after certain meals, then it might worth it to test your diet...

Within your diet, there could be many possible causes. It could be an allergy, intolerance, overeating, eating the same things or maybe the problem involves refined carbohydrates, processed foods, trans fats, artificial sweeteners, or alcohol.

According to [healthline.com](http://health.com/), the elimination diet is the gold standard for identifying allergies and intolerances.

**Elimination diet in a nutshell**

Essentially the elimination diet is pretty simple...

You **prepare** for it, you **eliminate** certain foods until symptoms disappear, you **reintroduce** them back one at a time and you **evaluate** which foods you think might be triggering your symptoms.

But this doesn't answer the question of which foods to eliminate, if now is the right time and more, so let's get into more detail...

# Prepare:

**Is now the right time?**

The first phase is preparation

First, you need to ask yourself: is it the right time for an elimination diet?

Keep in mind that you need to be able to eliminate certain foods, track your symptoms and everything you eat vigorously, and possibly keep doing this for some weeks. So if you are really busy, traveling or want to eat out a lot, then now might not be the ideal time.

But if you decide that now is the right time, then the first step is to contact your doctor, to rule out other possible causes of your brain fog. If you have an allergy, then the symptoms can potentially be life-threatening.

**Make a list of foods to avoid:**

Next, you need to make a list of foods to avoid.

But how do you know which foods to avoid? and how many?

If you don't have any idea about what might be triggering you, then you can either buy a food sensitivity test or spend some time tracking everything you eat, as well as any symptoms that might arise.. But keep in mind that while symptoms usually arise within a few hours of eating the trigger food, it could be delayed by up to 48 hours, which would make it very hard to pinpoint.

It's also worthwhile to know the most common triggers:

&amp;#x200B;

* For allergies, the big 8 is: milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybean.
* Some common food sensitivities are: Dairy, wheat, gluten, caffeine, salicylates, histamine, FODMAPs, sulfites, fructose, artificial sweeteners, colorings, and flavorings.

And in order to decide how many foods to eliminate, it's important to remember that there might be more than one food that is causing you trouble, and if you just eliminate one of them, then you will still experience symptoms and have to do it all over again.

On the other hand, eliminating too many foods is harder to adhere to, and you are at a bigger risk of creating nutritional deficiencies, which might cause new symptoms to occur. So choosing which foods to avoid is a balancing act.

Once you know what to eliminate, write down all things that contain that thing. For example, if gluten is on your list, then write down all things that contain gluten.

**Make a list of what to eat instead:**

It's also important to make a list of what you are going to eat instead, to make sure you are prepared and aren't going to face any nutritional deficiencies.

**Prepare in which order you want to reintroduce foods:**

At last, you'll want to make a plan for the order in which you will reintroduce the foods you have eliminated. Here you can prioritize starting with the foods you miss the most, the most healthy ones or the one you think are the least likely to cause you trouble.

You can try different forms of the same food separately. For example, trying the white part and the yellow part of an egg separately. It can also be a good idea to try pure forms of your trigger food, like pure wheat if you suspect that might be your trigger.

## Elimination:

The next phase is the elimination. Here you remove all the foods from your list for 2-4 weeks and write down if you notice any symptoms still occurring. You need to have been completely symptom-free for 5 days before moving on to the next phase. If you haven't been symptom-free for at least 5 days at the end of the 2-4 weeks, then consider removing other foods and doing 2-4 additional weeks. But be aware that you could have created a nutritional deficiency because of the foods you eliminated.

## Reintroduction:

The next phase is the reintroduction. Here you reintroduce one food at a time and track any symptoms that might occur. You should wait 3-7 days before introducing a new food since it can take 48 hours for symptoms to occur, and also because you might be able to tolerate some amount of your trigger foods.

If you experience symptoms but are unsure if the food you reintroduced was the trigger, then wait 5 days, until you don't have any symptoms and try reintroducing the food again. But if you reintroduce some food and are certain that the food is the culprit, then wait with introducing the next food until you don't experience any symptoms.

## Evaluate:

The last phase is the evaluation. Now you should evaluate how certain you feel that you found your trigger foods. If you are uncertain about a few of the foods, then you might run the experiment again with those foods.

Also remember that you might be able to handle some amount of your trigger foods, and your sensitivity to foods can change over time.

If you choose to eliminate some foods entirely, then it can be worthwhile to find some replacement foods that make sure you still get all the nutrients you need.

If you want to, you can check out [this animated video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T62ShMKMxqY&amp;feature=youtu.be) I made about the elimination diet and Brain fog."

Working for yourself can be lonely and isolating, now more so than ever. I think spending some time with a team of people that support you professionally, even if you don't work with them, would really help. In the short terms, because of the lockdown, but also in the long run.

The idea is one focused weekly call with 4-6 other professionals who work in a similar field and have similar goals. You each get 10-15 minutes to explain what you do, what your current goals are, and what your current obstacles are. I'll do my best to only match people with others who have similar levels of experience.

The idea is that it will help you stay on track by setting your professional goals and then stay accountable to them through the coming weeks and months. It is also a chance to give and /or receive professional guidance, feedback and support.

I can figure out a form so that people are paired with people in the same field, similar goals and similar levels of experience.

Anyone interested?

Please leave a comment below or DM me so that I can gauge whether or not it is worth putting something like this together.

Any other feedback, or ways the idea could be improved, are most welcome."

Now he pursues painting spiritual and intuitive paintings. He sees every painting or just the particles of it during meditation. He transfers those pictures – glimpses of it out onto the canvas and the whole image gets the true meaning.

A little about me and why I made this podcast, I was in the Army for a good chunk of my adult life. When I was a kid I saw 9/11 on the news and just wanted to do my part so when I was 17 my parents let me sign up for the Army. In 2010 I deployed to Afghanistan and was there for a year, and like many others I came back with some issues and traumas. For years I struggled with PTSD even after I was out and a free man. My mind was still at war, finally hitting rock bottom I realized that I was the only one who could fix my situation. So I started looking at my life and took steps to make it better, meditation and practicing mindfulness saved my sanity. After prolonged periods of meditation I finally broke free of my mental torment. Now I spend my days trying to help other people who suffer as I did. Alan Watts and Thich Nhat Hanh were a big influence in learning about life and my mental state of mind. 

Thanks for reading!

I have a kind of weird problem. I have a pretty decent amount of friends. I have enough people that I could talk with if I have problems. I have quite a big social circle. I have a girlfriend. And I have a good family life.

For some reason though I feel isolated and lonely to a point where I feel almost depressed. It even hurts physically and it distracts me all the time. Somehow I cannot identify the problem here.

I have social interactions at least every other day for more than one hour at least. And looking at it from an outside perspective I am definitely not lonely. I am surrounded by friends in my life.

Sometimes I think that the problem is that I don't have a lot of connection with them. I rarely ask them if they want to do something so I see my friends maybe once or twice a month. Maybe that is part of the reason but it doesn't seem to me that this is everything.

Because even when I meet friends and socialize a lot, I feel useless and pathetic when I spent too much time alone. It feels like I am competing in the social game and I feel bad because I am not meeting people. I basically feel like a loser.

The funny thing though is, that whenever I socialize a lot I feel the urge to isolate myself again because I guess I am an ambivert who needs both.

So the point that confuses me is the following: I am not lonely and I have a lot of social contacts. But somehow I still feel isolated. It is not the alone time though, but the feeling of not having upcoming social events in the near future. For example if I know that I will have 10 social events, parties etc. in the next two weeks, I don't mind spending multiple days alone.

My question now is: What are your thoughts? Do you think that is is an outside problem and I just need to get out of my comfort zone and ask people more often and schedule more events? Or do you think it is more about my inner game and that I am competing and comparing my social life to that of others?"

Obviously the answer is still 42. You should have 42 results. That sounds even more nonsensical, doesn’t it?

Let’s rephrase this question again slightly. Try asking instead, How many results could I have?

And again suppose I say 42. You could have 42 results. Now it sounds like you’re asking permission, doesn’t it? If I say you could have 42, you’ll probably resist having any limit placed upon the number you *could* have.

If you think about it, there’s really just one answer that makes sense now.

And that answer is *one*.

And it's not always easy being around family who are inappropriate or negative, so I wanted to share a few tips that you can use to deal with difficult family members and actually enjoy yourself during the holidays.

I've made a video about it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqvDoqRCdjU

Or if you prefer reading:

1.Set Expectations

If Aunt Sue always complains about ALL the drama going on in her life, guess what’s going to happen when you see her again? She’s going to complain about all the drama going on in her life. If Uncle George tends to try to guilt trip you because you haven’t visited him enough, guess what? He’s going to try and guilt trip you. So don’t be shocked if a family member does something that you always find annoying. Because chances are…they haven’t changed. So, before we leave the house to visit family, we can prepare out mindset that these things will probably happen so we won’t be as caught off guard when they do. So, once your run into Aunt Sue you can be like.. “Oh yep..that’s Aunt Sue talking about her drama again” or “Yep, Uncle George is guilt tripping me again. Shocker.”

2. Plan Around Your Triggers

What does your family do that always sets you off? Is it when your mom starts treating you like a 5 year old again the moment you step into the house? Or is it when your dad turns into a negative Nancy when you’re all trying to have a nice meal together? Knowing what triggers your emotions BEFORE spending time with family will help you to create a plan to navigate around those triggering experiences or it can help you avoid them altogether.

3. Prepare Your Responses

We’ve all gotten them. We’ve all gotten the good ole’ awkward, intrusive questions like “When are you getting married?” or “Why haven’t you lost weight?” or “When are you having kids?” So, what we can do to handle that kind of situation is to make an emergency list of subjects that you can use to change the conversation. Or you could even prepare a list of responses for questions you’re anticipating. You can try using humor in your responses, like if someone asks when you’re getting married you can say “I’m really happy right now and in no rush to get married. But feel free to send me money and a gift anyway.” or just completely change the subject “I don’t really want to talk about getting married, but I WOULD like to talk about how amazing this gravy is. Aunt Betty what ingredients did you use to make this gravy?” If someone keeps persisting, feel free to excuse yourself from the conversation.

4. Ask Questions

If someone usually asks you inappropriate questions or if you like to avoid being the center of attention, the best way to get the attention off of yourself is to ask other people questions. This not only gets the attention off of you and on to someone else, but it gives you a chance to connect with a family member and you might even learn something new about them that you may not have known before.

5. Don’t Bring Up Off Limit Topics

Politics. Gossip. Death. These are few of many topics that should be off limits, so you don’t get into any emotionally fueled arguments or conversations. Try sticking with more positive subjects such as what’s happening around you in the room, or happy childhood memories, or travel plans, or even favorite tv shows.

6. Avoid Drama

Who knows how to get under your skin more than your family? If you’ve got a family member who is trying to push your buttons, don’t take the bait. Stay cool and don’t enter into the drama. Because when you don’t engage, the drama ends. This could mean you quickly change the conversation or excuse yourself and leave the area if you have to.

7. Take Breaks

Don’t feel obligated to stay with your family the whole. entire. time. Taking a breather every now and then can help you regroup if you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed. You can find another room to chill in or go for a walk. It’s ok!

8. Put Yourself in Their Shoes

Your cousin who’s a bit passive aggressive, your sister who is a little controlling, your mom who is a bit critical…there’s a reason they are the way that they are. Something has happened that has caused them to act this way or they’re fighting a battle that we know nothing about. Maybe your mom lost her parents and it’s hard time of year for her. Maybe your sister is going through some tough times with her business. Maybe your cousin is having a few family problems at home. I guarantee there’s more to them than what you are seeing right in that moment. This doesn’t excuse their behavior, but it helps you understand why they may be acting in a certain way. Showing a bit of empathy can help us look past the rude behavior, not take it personally.

9. Look for the Good

Yeah your family may have annoying habits. Yeah there may be family members that drive you crazy. But if we go in focusing on what we dislike about each person, we’re not going to have a good time. So let’s look for the good in each person. Before you get to the family gathering, grab a pen and paper and write down something that you like about each person. Focus on that the whole time you’re there. Because when we focus on the good, it’s going to life our mood and we’re going to have more of a positive experience.

10. Know What You Can Control

You can’t control what people do. You can’t control what people say. But you CAN control how you think, what you do, and what you say. Sometimes it’s easy to assume our old roles when we step into the house, like reacting when your brother starts teasing you or getting upset when your family picks on your for being the youngest. But you don’t have to be that person anymore. You’re a grown adult and you get to choose how you respond. Show them the leveled up person you’ve become.

11. Focus on Adding Value

Instead of solely thinking of our family as obstacles to overcome, let’s focus on how we can add value into their lives. What is one small action or gesture we can do to add value into someone else’s life and make their day better? Maybe that’s really listening to the story grandma has already told 100 times when everyone else is ignoring her. Or Maybe that’s volunteering to help out with the dishes. When we focus on adding value, it helps us to shift our mindset from “What am I going to get out of this experience?” to “What can I personally do to make someone else’s life better today?” When we have this kind of mindset, we have the power to transform each and every moment. Even if you don’t receive the same kind of gesture back, you are teaching others through your actions how to respect and value other people.

12. Change Your Mindset

You’re with your family on this special occasion to have fun – not merely survive. And if our mindset is “I’m not going to enjoy this holiday” “This is going to be the worst day ever” guess what? We’re not going to enjoy the holiday and it’s going to be the worst day ever. But if we go in with the mindset of “No matter what, I’m going to enjoy this day and the people around me as much as possible” then our brain is going to go in and look for different ways on how to enjoy the day. If something doesn’t go right or someone says something that strikes a nerve, remind yourself of that mindset and continue to constantly look for the positives. Don’t let a bad 5 minutes cause you to have a bad day."

0,"The Wisdom of Carl Jung **Introduction**

Carl Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology. He knew Sigmund Freud, and the two were in correspondence and collaboration for some time on their joint vision of psychology.

His work contained a number of new and interesting ideas that helped to advance the field of psychology, including: individuation, archetypal phenomena, the collective unconscious, the shadow, complexes, synchronicity, and extraversion and introversion.

Here are 5 of his quotes, with my interpretation underneath for further clarity and understanding.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*""Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.""*

Projection, a common defence mechanism, is when we attribute something to another that is really about is. It usually takes the form of unacceptable thoughts and impulses, or an aspect of ourselves that we have previously denied or repressed. If we want to reduce this irritation and gain a deeper understanding our ourselves, we must become aware of our projections and try to discover and resolve the internal conflict that is causing it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*“Knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darkness of other people.""*

According to Jung, we are best prepared to confront and deal with the malevolent or 'dark side' of others, by first becoming aware of, and taking responsibility for our own. We achieve this through a process known as the integration of the shadow. The Shadow represents unconscious material that usually, but not exclusively, contains the ‘darker’ elements of our psyche; the less desirable aspects of one's personality.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*“*[*One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious*](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1Jgk8flut0/)*.""*

Expanding our awareness, gaining insight, and becoming a more integrated and whole person requires us to courageously face the contents of our unconscious mind, which includes elements of the psyche that have been suppressed. The 'shadow' of the mind contains contents of all the things we do not want to face right now, and therefore, becoming more 'enlightened' is rarely an easy and simple process.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*“Your visions will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.”*

If we are always looking to the eternal world to discover our true identity, our purpose, our dreams and destiny, then we may be following a script giving to us by others, or we may end up with nothing substantial and worthwhile at all. Through self-examination and self-exploration, we will begin to awaken our true self, and through connecting to our core values and principles, we will have a clearer vision for our life purpose.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*“Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”*

How much of our life is determined by the contents of our own mind, much of which we are not aware of, or through external circumstances that are out of our control is not fully known? The higher our self-awareness is, through bringing our unconscious thoughts, feelings, and desires into the light of our conscious mind, the less likely they will direct our life without our knowledge. Often, what people call fate was of their own making all along, except they were not fully aware of the forces that caused it. \[[See post: Finding your life’s purpose](https://www.reddit.com/r/MindOverMatterScott/comments/a114mp/finding_your_lifes_purpose/)\]

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

As you can see, a common theme to Jung’s quotes and ideas is about understanding our own mind and heart through awareness and integration. The more we understand ourselves, the more conscious and present we become, and the better equipped we will be to understand and deal with the challenges of the world."
0,"The Low Information Diet: A Cure for Distraction &amp; Anxiety Realizing that my mind was a mess, constantly distracted and fragmented, I put it on a Low Information Diet. 

This involves carefully vetting inputs to ensure that they are of value. I asked honestly whether my consumption of something enhanced or detracted from my quality of life. I noticed that email, for example, consumed a large amount of my attention, while providing little fulfillment in my life. Netflix had also captured my attention and held it hostage for hours each week. By tapering off of the potential addiction to information and cutting the “empty calories,” *or* useless information, I recovered a sense of ownership over my attention. 

I had to rewwire myself from the false belief that more information is always better. Most of what I paid attention to, like news soundbites, had no practical value, only serving to distract from what’s important in my life.

The Low Information Diet is a direct remedy to information overload. Gaining power over my attention through a Low Information Diet not only helped me generate original ideas for my book, but most importantly allowed me to pay better attention to the people and things I care about. The more essential information stopped getting conjoined with useless inputs and lost in the subconscious processor. 

I was previously one of the anxious masses that check their phones every few minutes for a hit of dopamine, a Pavlovian slave to my device. On a Low Information Diet, I feel like I can effectively harness the information, widely accessible, that *actually matters* to me. That’s the beauty of the Information Age – for those with the mental power it provides endless opportunities for learning and creation. The knowledge economy rewards those who know how to optimize for deep focus, happily missing out on surface-level happenings. I recommend the Low Information Diet to all! Shamelss plug: I am now trying to spread the Low Information (somewhat ironically, given that phones are often the source of distraction) through [this mental fitness app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fitmind-meditation-training/id1474170096). I am hoping it can get others to similarly begin to **pay attention to where they pay attention** and train a ""fit mind."""

0,"How to Deal with Negative Emotions (Anger, Fear, Guilt, Sadness) Sometimes we can stay stuck in negative emotions for a while or we can completely ""lose it"" in the heat of the moment. So, I wanted to share a few tips that I find helpful to work through the emotions whenever I'm dealing with them.

If you prefer videos:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch2MP7kUkf4&amp;t=101s

If you prefer reading:

1. Accept the Emotion

We usually see a negative emotion as a bad thing or a weakness. But the emotion itself is a natural part of being human. All it is is a signal from our body that something isn’t quite right and that we need to take action and work through it.

Because if we don’t, then the negative emotion can completely take over and ruin our day.

So, we’ve got to accept it, because when we can accept our emotion, then we’re in a position to take action and work through it. And part of accepting our emotion means we acknowledge that it’s there and we don’t judge ourselves for it.

2. Make a Choice

Feeling frustrated is normal, but snapping at someone else..that’s a choice. Feeling afraid is normal, but not doing something that you want to do is a choice. Feeling guilty is normal, but constantly thinking you’re a bad person is a choice.

So, regardless of how we feel, we get to choose how we control our thoughts and actions. We can’t control negative situations or what someone says or does to us. But.. we can be in charge of how we think… and what we do.

So, we can choose to attach to every negative thought that we have and let the negative emotion completely consume us. Or we can choose to problem solve through our feelings which leads us to the third tip and that is to

3. Create an Action Plan 

Before a negative emotion hits me, I like to be on the offense instead of defense. I want to be ready for when it happens, so I can problem solve through it immediately instead of letting my emotions control me.

So we have to remember that we usually have negative emotions that either rise up in the heat of the moment(like when your kids are arguing and you get instantly frustrated) or the emotions have been lingering for a while (like constantly feeling worthless at your job)

So creating an action plan can help you identify a few strategies to use BEFORE you find yourself in an emotional state. Before you start snapping at someone because you’re angry. Before you start guilt tripping yourself about the past again. Before you talk yourself out of a job opportunity.

Here are 8 examples you can use: 

1. Identify possible triggers. What is it that usually triggers your emotion? Is it when people aren’t listening to you? Is it after you watch a movie? Is it when you hang out with certain friends? Identifying what sets you off helps you navigate around triggering experiences or it helps you to prevent them altogether. 

2. Put yourself in the other person’s shoes. If someone makes you upset, instead of taking it as a personal attack, ask “What’s happened to this person to make them act that way?” This helps you sympathize with the other person instead of getting instantly emotional. Like someone cutting you off in traffic. Maybe they’re rushing to a family emergency or they have a passenger who is yelling at them or they’re late for a major interview because they had a flat tire earlier. 

3. Breathe. Take a breath and say to yourself “I’m not going to let this emotion get the best of me.” This is going to wake up the decision making part of your brain, so that you can start to gain control. 

4. Start counting. Think nothing but the numbers. Make a goal to count to 10. If you have a lot of emotion try counting to 100 instead. You’ll notice as you continue to count, your heart rate will start to slow down a bit, and it gives you time to gather your thoughts before taking action. 

5. Communicate. If someone has upset you, setting a time to communicate with them is one of the best ways to resolve any kind of issues that are causing your negative emotions.

6. Call friends and family. When you have a support group around you, it helps you to feel less alone when you’re feeling emotional. 

7. Eat Healthy foods and Exercise. This is one we hear all the time. Numerous studies show eating right and exercising elevates your mood and reduces stress. 

8. Retrain your brain to think positive thoughts, so you’re not attaching to every negative thought that comes your way.

Now all of these strategies aren’t going to fit into every kind of scenario. Some are going to be more effective than others in different kinds of situations. You have to find what works best for you. If you have more to add that have worked well for you, definitely share those in the comments below. The more strategies we can collect, the better."

I've found it very helpful to clarify my thoughts. Feedback wanted - app link inside. [https://melius.app](https://melius.app/)

Not very well optimized for mobile yet sorry.

The idea is to write something every day to help clarify your thoughts and refresh your mind. It's based on the idea of ""Morning Pages"" from ""The Artist's Way"".

There are other writing/journal apps out there, but the exercises are the differentiator. The main idea is to ""just write"", but often the hardest part is getting started, so you can simply type a # and get a list of prompts. Most are exercises in self improvement. I also put a fair bit of effort into just having a nice editor to work with.

I've been using it for a few weeks now and it definitely helps me clarify my thoughts.

Only the writing page is done for now, there's not yet a way to read your past entries, but I'm working on that! Other upcoming features are:

* Streaks - keep count of how many days in a row you reach your word target
* Configurable word target

I'd love if you gave it a go, and let me know if you think it's valuable. There's also a survey linked from the 'entry complete' page that will take all of 30 seconds to complete and helps me collate feedback. I'm looking for feedback on whether you found it useful, what you'd like to see added, etc."

They’re basically bandaids we apply every time we get hurt. We’ve been rejected? Well, maybe is the other person’s fault, not mine. Let’s put that bandaid on. I have no money? It’s government's fault. Let’s apply that too. And so on and so forth, every time we can’t really cope with the pain or just the plain lack of meaning of something, we’re applying another bandaid.

As we cruise forward on our own timeline on this Earth, we keep applying bandaid on top of bandaid on top of bandaid, forgetting that, once we understand how to cope with a specific pain, that specific bandaid must be removed. Instead of keeping ourselves slim (and, truth to be told, also vulnerable) we’re patching ourselves over and over, until our own sense of reality is hidden inside a huge ball of bandaids.

0,"How to Overcome Imposter Syndrome (7 TIPS TO STOP FEELING LIKE A FRAUD)  Hi Everyone! Just wanted to share a few tips that I find helpful in overcoming imposter syndrome.

And if you've never heard of imposter syndrome, it's essentially when we constantly doubt our accomplishments and we feel that at any moment people are going to call us out as a fraud, despite all the evidence of our achievements.

So, for example someone who recently got a promotion at work, may feel they don’t deserve the promotion and believe that everyone’s going to find out that they aren’t good enough for the position.

Or

A student may question if they are smart enough to pass an exam, even though they spent hours studying and normally make pretty good grades.

So, imposter syndrome is very very common. It can strike anywhere to anyone at anytime, and if you do have imposter syndrome, you are not alone!

Here's 7 tips to help overcome imposter syndrome:

I've made a video all about it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ga0JMKJOZA

Or if you prefer reading:

1. Create a Fact Folder 

And a fact folder is a place where you can store evidence of all of your achievements, so if you have an imposter strike you can refer back to the folder to keep your mind focused on the facts. Because it’s kinda hard to argue the facts, right? So, this could be

• Statements about the trials, the hardships, or hard work that have led to where you are today.

• Compliments that people have given you, whether it’s been in person or through messages.

• Positive reviews if you own an online business.

• Awards given or pictures of trophies.

Whatever has been an achievement or success put it straight into the folder! And next to each piece of evidence, write HOW you were able to achieve that. When we define our “how,” it helps us identify the steps we took to achieve our success and it leaves less room for our imposter syndrome to discredit our accomplishments. So, instead of just writing down “I was offered a promotion.” Write “I was offered a promotion, because I exceeded my targets over and over again, and I was doing tasks that were beyond what I initially agreed to do in my signed contract.”

2. Write Down Your Success Goals

So, when we complete a project or task that was successful, our imposter syndrome sometimes kicks in and we think “Yeah, that was ok, BUT I should have done better.” So, when we understand and define what success looks like to us BEFORE going into a project or task, then it helps to prevent our minds from thinking we should have done better.

3. Set Realistic Goals

Setting goals is completely normal. But when we set unrealistic goals, then it’s likely for us to completely avoid whatever it is we want to do, because we become overwhelmed before we even start. And if we attempt the unrealistic goal, then we’re more likely to fail…because again, it’s unrealistic. Right? And that can lead to imposter feelings. So, whenever we’ve got a massive goal we want to achieve, it’s a good idea to take that BIG HUGE goal that’s causing us intense pressure, and break it down into small, achievable steps that can be measured. For example, if you want to lose 20 lbs, don’t give yourself the goal of losing 20 lbs in two weeks. A more realistic and achievable goal would be to lose a pound a week for 20 weeks.

4. Own your Accomplishments

A lot of times we can discredit ourselves with our achievements. We say “It was no big deal” or “I got very lucky” or we completely give the credit to someone else when we had a MAJOR part in everything. So, it’s important we be aware of the language we use with others and state the facts, because it reinforces our hard work. So, for example, if someone compliments us on something that took us a lot of time to do, let’s simply say “Thank You. I put a lot of work into this” instead of “Oh it was nothing.”

5. Have an Action Plan for Mistakes

It’s easy for us to feel like a total imposter once we make a mistake. But mistakes are normal. Everyone makes them.. Every person you think is extremely successful. Yep, they’ve made TONS of mistakes. No one is immune. And when we make that one mistake, what does our brain do? Oh..it looks at all the accomplishments and achievements we’ve had and completely disregards that one mistake. NOPE. It focuses on that one mistake, despite all of our past success. BUT, when we understand mistakes are normal and part of our learning and development, then we’re able to create an action plan for when they happen instead of dwelling on that one error. So, an example of an action plan could be: Make a list that has an equal amount of positives and negatives that happened during the event and write down any improvements that you want to make.

6. Know Your Imposter Moments

When do you tend to feel like an imposter? Is there a certain time of the day when it strikes? Does it happen when you’re at work, when you’re by yourself at home or when you’re out around other people? It’s important to be aware of when you experience imposter syndrome, so that you’re able to prepare yourself. For example, if you usually have imposter syndrome in the middle of a work meeting, you can prepare your mindset before going into your next work meeting by doing one of the tips above like looking at the achievements in your fact folder.

7. Feel the Feeling and Take Action Anyway

A lot of times we feel pretty nervous or doubtful before diving into a big project or stepping into a new role. But it’s important to remember that these feelings are normal. We all have those feelings, especially when it’s something we haven’t done before. So when we have a good opportunity in front of us that’d we like to pursue and we feel like we’re not good enough or feel like we’re not ready, we should take action anyway. Because there’s a reason this opportunity has appeared in your life. It didn’t come out of the blue. There’s a reason a new role was offered to you or you’re about to take on a big project. Think about what you had to do in order to get this opportunity. When we take action even if we feel a bit nervous, that means amazing things are about to happen, because we’re going to be outside of our comfort zone, which will push us to the next level, which is where all the magic happens. And if we never try, we may always end up regretting it."

For this reason, I want to share 2 ways that helps us build our self-worth, so we can better understand our value and live a happier life!

I've made a video about it here:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T92S7kBdBRg&amp;t=23s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T92S7kBdBRg&amp;t=23s)

&amp;#x200B;

Or if you prefer reading:

1. Step Outside of Your Comfort Zone

One reason we may have low self worth is because we don’t believe we deserve good things in life. We don’t believe we our worthy of a good job. We don’t believe we are worthy of a good relationship. We don’t believe we are worthy of a good body.

And if we are being honest with ourselves, a lot of times we have these beliefs, because we are afraid. We’re afraid when we CHANGE something in our life and step outside of our comfort zone that we will fail or others will criticize us or that we will ultimately get hurt. And a lot of those fears most likely come from our past experiences…whether you had someone make fun of you, or you were pressured to perform well in school by a parent, or you experienced some major financial hardships or you’ve had some sort of trauma.

So, any change we even THINK about doing, our brain says “HOLD UP! STOP. Don’t even think about doing that because it might hurt you.” Our brain automatically tries to protect us from the unknown, because it doesn’t want us to experience pain.

Have you ever gotten the urge to dance at a social event when the music comes on and then your brain says ""NOPE. STOP. PEOPLE WILL MAKE FUN OF YOU."" Or have you had the urge to go talk to someone new and your brain says ""STOP. THAT PERSON’S NOT GOING TO LIKE YOU. STAY AWAY.""

Our brain acts like a bodyguard. Which isn’t a bad thing, because it’s doing its job. Right? Our brain wants us to experience pleasure and not pain.

But it can REALLY get in the way when we want to make a positive change that’s actually good for us, so we can get what we deserve in life.

So, how do we break that pattern of the brain automatically saying “NOOO. DON’T DO THAT OR YOU WILL BE IN PAIN!”?

We say..""Thanks brain, appreciate you trying to protect me, but I got it from here."" (like in the movies...when someone rocks up at a super wealthy person’s house and a bodyguard appears, gives them a hard time because they’re being very protective, and then the wealthy person is like…""Thank you Alfred, I've got it from here"").

So when we say “We’ve got it from here.” WE take control of our thoughts instead of letting OUR MINDS run the show.

We INTERRUPT our brain pattern of automatically telling us “NO” whenever we want to make a change.

And that makes us feel pretty good, right?

Because WE’VE gained control and WE’RE going to tell our brain how WE run things around here.

It’s when we gain that control, that we can then take one small but courageous step forward towards what we deserve.

We take one step outside of our comfort zone into the direction we want to go. Then when we complete one step, we take another step. And another step. And another step. Until we reach our ultimate goal and get what we deserve.

And it may feel a bit awkward or scary at first, because we’ve been listening to our brain tell us “NO” without doing anything about it for a VERY long time.

But after that first step, I promise you will feel so accomplished and SO proud of yourself that you could do that.

AND ultimately You deserve happiness. You deserve whatever you want in life. It’s all about just taking control of that brain trying to protect you, and letting him know “Thanks..but no thanks. This step forward in my life will actually bring me WAY MORE happiness than where I’m at right now. And I’ve got it from here.""

The next way we can increase our self worth is by

2. Stop Comparing Yourself to Others

SO. MANY. TIMES. we try to measure up our worth by comparing our life to someone else.

We think…

* They have a better car than me, so I must not be good enough
* They have a smaller waist than me so I’m not good enough
* They have more money than me, so I must not be good enough

And it’s the BIGGEST LIE EVER.

Do you know the odds of you being alive right now are 1 in 400 trillion? 1 in 400 trillion! Do you know the chain of events that had to happen for you to even exist? You have WAY more of a chance to win the lottery than being alive right now! And we spend our time being ALIVE by comparing ourselves to someone else and not feeling good enough?!

That’s not living my friend.

You are SO special and SO needed in this world. Your unique ideas and views are NEEDED in this world. You have a major ADVANTAGE IN life JUST by being YOU, because there is not one person on this planet that has seen or experienced the world like you. Which means, NO ONE is going to have the same strengths or talents as YOU.

So, instead of comparing ourselves to others, let’s start looking inward and being in tune with ourselves and ask..”What actually makes me happy and what makes me feel ALIVE?” And go do that. Because You deserve to make the MOST out of this one life you have. Not wasting it. by comparing yourself to others and trying to achieve what they have, because you think THAT would make you more valuable.

Just by being you, you 1 in 400 trillion person, that is valuable enough! :)"

0,"How to Teach People How to Treat Us (Gain Respect from Others) Hi everyone!

Just wanted to share a few things I've learned on teaching people how to treat me with respect.

Because it can be so frustrating and disheartening when someone behaves badly towards us and we wish SO MUCH that they can see their bad behavior and correct it.

But unfortunately, we can't change anyone's rude behavior, but I want to focus on what we can control...and that is us.

So here are 3 examples of how we can be in CONTROL and teach others how to treat us with RESPECT, especially when we find ourselves in awkward and disrespectful situations.

Here's a video I made all about it:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvH97uusFng&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvH97uusFng&amp;feature=youtu.be)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you prefer reading:

The first way we can teach others how we want to be treated is to

1. Respond don’t React

Say you’re in a good mood, minding your own business. You’re watching your fav youtube channel, and then out of no where your significant other, let’s call him Bob, storms into the room, starts yelling about how enormous the electricity bill is this month. Then he starts blaming it on you, because you like to keep your heater on. And he starts calling you names..like stupid and careless

When this happens, what emotions are you feeling? You’re probably feeling a variety of emotions. Angry that Bob stormed in and yelled, confused as to why the bill is so high, guilty because you think you may be the culprit of the high electricity bill, and mostly hurt because Bob is being disrespectful.

And you’ve got a couple of choices on how to address this situation:

• 1. You can choose to react negatively which means you change your good mood and take on the negativity, which now puts YOU in a BAD mood and then you fight back and start yelling at Bob and calling him names. OR

• 2. You can choose to respond positively. Which means that you don’t engage with his negative actions. Instead you calmly say “I understand that you may be feeling frustrated right now, Bob. However, I don’t want to talk to you when you’re yelling at me and calling me names. I find it completely disrespectful. So, I’m going to leave the room and when you’re a bit more calm, then I’ll be more than happy to talk with you.

See the difference. When we choose to react, we take on whatever emotion the other person is feeling and we wear it. Our good mood gets ruined and we immediately go into a negative headspace.

But when we respond, we’re not going to take on negative emotions. We’re not going to allow ourselves to get pushed down to the other person’s level. We take control of the situation and distance ourselves from it, so it doesn’t affect us at all. When we do this, we TEACH the other person that we don’t accept that kind of behavior towards us.

I like to look at this situation the same as if you were dealing with a toddler throwing a tantrum. Because essentially this is what the other person is doing--acting like a toddler. And If a toddler yelled and screamed at you, you wouldn’t yell and scream back, right? You would calmly explain what is an acceptable way to talk to you. You don’t yell back at them and call them names, because you’ve got to role model and SHOW THROUGH YOUR ACTIONS what is acceptable behavior. That’s how they learn. Right?

The exact same principle applies to adults. Whenever we run into someone who is acting disrespectful towards us, we respond by staying calm and in control of our words and actions, instead of reacting negatively by mimicking the other person’s rude behavior.

The next way we teach people how to treat us is to:

2. Enforce Boundaries

Say you’ve had one of the most stressful work days of your life and you have a coworker who invites you out to dinner. But you are EXHAUSTED and all you can think about is wrapping yourself in a blanket, grabbing your fav snack, and vegging out to your fav Netflix show.

So you’ve got two choices to make when this kind of situation happens: You say yes to your coworker and spend the rest of the evening probably regretting your decision.

Or you can set a boundary and communicate your wants and needs. A boundary is basically understanding what is best for you -emotionally, physically, and mentally. So, in this example, what you may feel is best is to say “no” because you want to rest. So as a response to our coworker we can say “Thanks so much for the invite. I won’t be able to make it tonight but I hope you have fun.”

Now, if we say yes, even if we don’t want to go…we may be the type of person who says yes to everything, regardless of what it is, because we don’t want to disappoint anyone or we don’t want to be seen as the boring person. The problem with this is that we become the “yes person.” People start to know us as the “yes” person, so they think they can ask us to do anything, because we will ALWAYS agree… Why do they do that? Because we’ve unintentionally taught people that’s what we do. If we never stand up for ourselves. If we never say no, then people learn… “oh ok, she says yes to everything, so if I ask anything of her, I know she’ll do it.”

Now, if we have the courage to say no, then sometimes we have someone who doesn’t respect our boundaries and tries to push us to do something anyway. And usually there’s some flattery or guilt thrown in like…

“please it won’t be the same without you!” or...”just this one time…you hardly ever go out” or “you don’t want to leave me hanging do you” Do these responses sound familiar to you? It’s hard to say no when we get these sort of responses, right?

But if we change our response from no to yes…then without even realizing, we teach people that they can push our boundaries if they want a certain response from us.

Again, this situation reminds me of communicating with a child. If a child asks for a piece of chocolate and you tell them they can’t have any…then they may throw a tantrum, or use flattery or try to guilt you by saying “you never let us have chocolate” or “pleaseee I’ve been so good today” you’re the best mom in the whole world”

If you give in and say yes, then that teaches the child that they can push your boundary to get what they want when you say no.

So, whenever we say no, it needs to be firm. Whenever we enforce any kind of boundary, we need to be firm with it.

When we do this, we teach people that we respect ourselves and they should do the same.

The next way we teach people how we want to be treated is by:

3. Communicate Your Feelings

Say you have a family member who always picks on you about your career. In so many words, they tell you that your job isn’t good enough and that you need to make more money. When they do this, it can make you feel angry, upset, or frustrated, because it makes you feel as if you’re not good enough even though you LOVE your job.

When this kind of situation arises, whenever a family member picks on you about something, usually two things happen, o You give the silent treatment and avoid this family member like the plague or o You just take it. You sit there. say nothing. and maybe even kinda laugh it off a bit

But when you do those two things, it’s not addressing the issue that is at hand which is: when that family member says unkind words to you, it makes you feel worthless. And because you’re not communicating with that family member, you’re essentially showing them that it’s ok to say those things.

So, what we should do instead is communicate our wants and needs with that family member. We should tell them how we feel when they say something that offends us and that we would appreciate it if they stopped.

Now some family members are completely oblivious when they say hurtful things to us. They aren’t intentionally trying to be mean or hurtful…they just have no idea that what they’re saying is offensive. And it takes us standing up and communicating with them, so they can realize that their words are actually hurtful. When this happens, they usually feel pretty bad and change their behavior.

Other times, you have family members who keep repeating the bad behavior, which at that point, you’ll have to set and enforce some boundaries, which may mean that you have communicate to them that you are going to distance yourself until they are able to correct their behavior.

Otherwise, if you do nothing, they don’t take you seriously and continue with their behavior."

0,"How to Wake up in a GOOD Mood (Start Your Day Off RIGHT!)☀️  Hi Everyone!

Just wanted to share a couple of things that helped me TREMENDOUSLY in starting my day off right. For many years I woke up in a bad mood dreading the day ahead, but now I wake up relaxed and focused. The two things I do are simple, yet extremely effective. Hope this post helps others who also have a hard time starting the day off on the right foot!

I've made a video if you'd like to learn more on how I start the day off right: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNPf-7UlJ0w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNPf-7UlJ0w)

If you prefer reading:

80% of us are doing something first thing in the morning that is RUINING the rest of the day. Can you guess what it is?

We check our phones first thing in the morning! And though it may seem harmless, I’ll tell you why I’ve decided to LOSE THE PHONE in the morning.

So, when we first wake up most of us, roll over, and before even getting out of bed we reach towards the night stand grab our phone—and we check what’s happening on social media. When we do this,

We run the risk the of becoming frustrated, annoyed, angry, or stressed because our newsfeed MAY be:

• Filled with pictures of everyone’s perfect little lives and our brain could start subconsciously comparing ourselves against them. OR

• We’ve got sponsored ads trying to sell us something. OR

• We can news that is completely negative and it gets you riled up.

And Then we could start reading emails and messages from people who are wanting us to do different things for them.

And our mind starts the day off in complete chaos. It’s in reactive mode, right? Before even getting out of bed, we can start the day off in a negative mindset. You wouldn’t happily let 70 people walk into your bedroom when you first wake up, right? So why are we letting them into our lives first thing in the morning on our phone?

We give our energy and attention all day long to other people, so the least we can do is not give away our energy first thing in the morning.

And I was guilty this for such a long time..but Now, what I like to do instead, is start the day by being proactive, so that I’m in control. Instead of starting the day being reactive and letting all of these things consume me.

So, before touching the phone, I spend at least 15-30 minutes working on what I want to do, whether that’s writing, reading, going for a walk, listening to music, …whatever it is.

Since, I’ve adopted this new habit, I noticed that I’m not as distracted during the day. I’m a lot more calm. I start the day off being productive which carries on to the afternoon. And for once, I’m excited to start the morning, instead of dreading it, because I’m working on what I want to do which ends up boosting my mood and energy for the day.

Losing the phone first thing in the morning has been a game changer in my life! And I highly highly recommend it if your life feels a bit stressful and chaotic right now.

The second self love habit that has changed my life in the morning is when I decided to STOP HITTING SNOOZE.

So when your alarm goes off and you hit the snooze and you start dozing off again scientific research shows that you trick your body into thinking its going back into a deep sleep. So, when you wake up again after only snoozing for 5, 10, 15 minutes, your brain and body are confused…which leads to that groggy feeling you get that lasts for the rest of the day. Have you ever had that? It’s called sleep inertia. And it is a BIG energy drainer.

And when you’re used to pressing snooze every single day when the alarm goes off, then you’re body starts to form a habit…so we can hit that snooze without even thinking twice about it.

Again..this was another bad habit of mine.

So, what I’ve done to help break the habit is I’ve changed the alarm sound, because the alarm sound acted as a trigger for me to roll over and turn the snooze on.

So, when I picked a new alarm sound, then that formed a new trigger, so that I could create a new habit to wake up more positive.

And the amazing new habit that I’ve implemented is naming 3 things that I’m grateful for.

So, now when I hear my new alarm sound, that is my new trigger to turn OFF the alarm and instantly name 3 reasons for why I’m grateful. This starts my day off right BECAUSE when I think of why I’m grateful, it puts me into a positive mindset, my mood is instantly lifted, and I’m more in a state of abundance rather than feeling like I’m lacking something.

If you want to take this tip to the next level, then you could put your phone somewhere where you cant reach it…like across the room or completely outside of the room. This forces you to get up to turn off the alarm, and it breaks that bad habit of reaching over for the phone without thinking.

There’s also around 30% of people who check their phone throughout the night, so having that thing away from you will help you not only wake up better but also sleep better."

0,"Top 10 Habits of a Venture Capitalist Turned Entrepreneur This past year I pivoted from a career in venture capital to create a mental health technology company. Here are a few of the habits that I've found have helped me get the most out of work and life:

[Note: I'm not claiming to be a superhero or Tim Ferriss, but hoping you might find one or two here to help you as well.]

1. Only check email and texts 3x daily unless planning something urgent. My phone is often in airplane mode or out of site. My notifications are always silenced. In a world of distraction, attention is our most valuable resource. I guard mine like a Bullmastiff. 

2. Don't schedule any calls or meetings before noon. From the time I wake up until I break my intermittent fast, this time is devoted to Deep Work, when I can get the most done without cluttering my mind with email and meetings.

3. Call or (even better) FaceTime a distant friend every Sunday. This helps maintain relationships and has helped a lot with the often-lonely life of an entrepreneur. Interpersonal connection is a psychological need that we all have from our evolution as hunter-gatherers. Yet 47% of Americans report that they are lonely. Connection matters, and is a key part of mental health, something I used to overlook as an entrepreneur.

4. Meditate for at least 15 mins every morning and night. This is non-negotiable. I can tell the difference in emotional regulation and focus on days where I've missed the morning session. And I waste a lot of time lying in bed awake if I don't get in the evening session. Ray Dalio, the most successful hedge fund manager of our time, attributes ""any success he's had"" to meditation. I couldn't agree more. (Shameless self-plug: my team created a science-backed meditation app that I use for these sessions www.fitmind.co)

5. Japanese green tea in the morning. Sencha or Matcha, is my preference. It's a smooth caffeination, as opposed to coffee and green tea has a lot of proven health benefits. This is a personal preference but has become a favorite part of my routine.

6. Take a cold shower every morning. Makes the rest of the day easy by mentally preparing me to willingly face discomfort. There are other benefits, like the hermetic effects of cold exposure and a temporary increase in ""happiness chemicals"" like adrenaline. Sucks at first, but you get used to it.

7. Read 1 hour before bed. The most successful people in the world generally read a ton. Warren Buffett DEVOURS literature. The more you know across different topics, the more you can form novel connections and innovate. I've learned to value learning way more than I ever did while in school. And the best part: I get to read what interests me! (currently reading Ken Wilber's A Brief History of Everything, perhaps the greatest philosopher of our time?)

8. Workout at least 3x per week. Richard Branson often talks about how important exercise is in his success as an entrepreneur. Despite what Trump seems to think (you have a set and limited amount of energy), working out is actually NET ENERGY POSITIVE. You feel better afterward and paradoxically have more time by increasing productivity.

9. Journal my dreams. Every morning I write down my dreams. If you think you don't dream, you do (3-5x per night). Anyone can improve their dream recall by setting a strong intention to write them down immediately upon awakening. Why is this an important habit for me? Your dreams contain important information about your subconscious mind and emotional states that might otherwise escape your conscious knowledge. There's a reason that the greatest psychologists of all time like Jung and Freud wrote whole books about dreams - they contain a lot of self-knowledge.

10. Count my blessings. Every night I think of at least 3 NEW things that I'm grateful for. This serves two purposes: 1) it makes me grateful in an age when we're constantly being told we don't have enough and 2) it codes my mind to look for grateful things each day (however small) knowing that I'll have to recall 3 new ones that night.

Hope you found this helpful and please let me know your own top habits in the comments, as I'm sure that there are some key ones that should've made my top 10.

Blessings,
Liam"

It’s not easy to be a young person in today’s chaotic and constantly changing world. Dealing with the burdens of our over-stressed, over-committed society — all while trying to grow, develop, and find happiness can lead to emotional overload.

That’s rough stuff when you’re just starting out in the world.

These numbers might sound scary, but there are ways to help our kids develop coping strategies that can improve their **mental health** and help boost the effectiveness of any other treatments.

### An Evidence-Based Approach

Modern medicine has come a long way in treating psychological issues; finding skilled and compassionate psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists can help young people get better. Finding the right doctor is key; they need to be able to connect with their patients and offer tools and knowledge that support positive change. In addition to traditional treatments, there are support programs that have been proven to be extremely effective.

Suffering and pain are almost inevitable experiences that we will all face at some point in our lives. Whether it is psychological, emotional, physical, or even spiritual, it is unfortunately very likely that we will endure some amount of hardship in one way or another. Having said that, there is a great difference between suffering needlessly, like an eternal victim of the negative circumstances of the world, and becoming a triumphant hero who is able to overcome their struggles, by allowing their discomfort to motivate them to become even stronger and wiser.

In religious terms, some consider suffering to be a punishment from God for not living in accordance with his will, whilst others believe the Devil to be the true cause of the suffering of humanity. Atheists take a more rational approach and believe it to simply be an unfortunate element of existence itself. Regardless of whether these beliefs are true or not, suffering is here to stay for the time being, and so we should become more prepared to deal with it by developing resilience, and learning skills to cope more effectively.

Causes of suffering range from the mistreatment from others, physical ailments, mental health disorders, trauma, tragedy, spiritual crises, general fears, extreme guilt, shame and self-hate.

People respond to suffering in a variety of ways, some of which have led to some of the worst crimes in history, and others have allowed people to transcend their suffering and become greater versions of themselves. Other methods include denial, distractions, medication, and various other ways of trying to numb the pain. The following three tips will hopefully give a more mature and healthy way of effectively reducing suffering experienced in our lives.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tip 1: Self-compassion**

When you suffer, you should practice having compassion for yourself, which should help mitigate much of the pain that comes with it. If you are being hard on yourself, or you believe that you don’t deserve compassion and forgiveness, then a good tip is to imagine you are caring for a close friend, family member, or other loved one.

Instead of saying:

**1)** “I’m a helpless victim”

**2)** “I deserves this”

**3)** “Why did this happen to me”

**4)** “I’m worthless”

Say:

**1)** “I choose to be a survivor”

**2)** “No one deserves to suffer”

**3)** “Nothing is personal”

**4)** “I am worthy, even though I am imperfect and make mistakes”

This method is particularly useful is you are ‘beating yourself up’ for mistakes and sins that you have made in the past. You should be aware of immoral things that you have done, and aim to change them, but endlessly tormenting yourself isn’t helpful and will only make things worse.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tip 2: Meaning**

It was theorised by the psychiatrist Viktor Frankl, who lived through the Holocaust, that one of the best solutions to suffering in life is by searching for meaning in it. He developed Logotherapy, which is a therapy based on existential analysis, and focusses on Kierkegaard’s *will* *to* *meaning*. One of the key principles is that striving to find meaning in our lives, is the most powerful, motivating and driving force in humans.

The three basic principles of logotherapy are as follows:

1. Life has meaning under all circumstances, even the most miserable ones.
2. Our main motivation for living is our will to find meaning in life.
3. We have freedom to find meaning in what we do, and what we experience, or at least in the stance we take when faced with a situation of unchangeable suffering.

So whatever problems we are facing in our lives, whether we are being haunted by memories of the past, or anticipating fears of the future, we should try to discover and derive some meaning out of it if possible. Sometimes the answer we are looking for may be obvious, whereas other times the meaning or purpose may seem elusive, so we will have to try harder to find it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tip 3: Defence mechanisms**

Two people may experience the same problem, the same frustration, the same pain and suffering, yet decide to deal with it in two completely different ways. The brain uses defence mechanisms to deal with unacceptable, or potentially harmful, stimuli and impulses. Many of these are classed as immature or even self destructive, whereas some are far more healthy and productive. The following are three recommended mature defence mechanisms that you should learn to use, and incorporate into your life; as opposed to the immature, destructive, and self-defeating ones.

**1) Altruism** \- One of the best and most productive ways to feel better about yourself and to distract yourself from pain is to focus on helping others instead. Ideas: help to feed or clothe the homeless, join an animal rights group, volunteer in a charity shop of soup kitchen, choose a vocation which is concerned with helping people, donate money to a worthwhile cause. Read this article for ideas on random acts of kindness: [https://daringtolivefully.com/random-acts-of-kindness-ideas](https://daringtolivefully.com/random-acts-of-kindness-ideas)

**2) Sublimation** \- Sublimation means to transform unacceptable impulses into more socially acceptable ones, which are more productive and less harmful. Examples include: take up running, cycling, play a sport, try martial arts, exercise, workout, creative expression such as music, writing or painting.

**3) Gratitude** \- Perhaps the problem isn’t that we are suffering too much; perhaps the problem is that we are not practicing gratitude enough to counterbalance the bad things in life. As often as you can make a mental or physical note of things that you feel grateful for. These could be positive memories from long ago, recent achievements and accomplishments, or any personal development you have noticed.

“How do you overcome the suffering of life? Be a better person.” \~ Jordan Peterson

“I assess the power of a will by how much resistance, pain, torture it endures and knows how to turn to its advantage.” \~ Friedrich Nietzsche

“He who has a why to live can bear almost any how.” \~ Friedrich Nietzsche

“In some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.” \~ Victor Frankl

Did you know that a study of more than 300 college students found heavier technology use was tied to greater risk for anxiety and depression, particularly among those using the devices as a “security blanket” — in essence, to avoid dealing with unpleasant experiences or feelings.

How do you think the massive influx of data we receive from social media affects our psyche? 

Have you ever quit social media before? 

If so, what were the noticeable effects it had on your life?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this as I believe phones lead to a large percentage of the chaos we adopt into our modern lives.

&amp;#x200B;

Piers Steel is a recognized expert on topics like motivation and **procrastination** and in his book ***""The procrastination equation""*** he gives an equation you can use to analyze exactly why you procrastinate.

&amp;#x200B;

**But what is procrastination?**

Piers Steel says that procrastination is a fight between the ***prefrontal cortex*** and our ***Limbic System***.

Considering immediate pleasures like food activates the limbic system while thinking about future benefits activates the prefrontal cortex.

Back in the day when our primary job was to hunt, you always had to act according to immediate pleasures and threats and for that reason you could rely on impulses from the limbic system, while today your success in life is highly influenced by your ability to delay gratification and for that reason you have to rely more on your prefrontal cortex for impulse control. Unfortunately, we have only partially evolved to the rising demands of self-control, through the development and use of the prefrontal cortex.

Interestingly, the development of our brains from our time inside the womb, through childhood and adolescence, roughly corresponds to the evolutionary development of the brain. In both cases the prefrontal cortex is one of the last regions to fully develop and even in it's most developed form, we are still wired to procrastinate.

&amp;#x200B;

**So how can we stop Procrastinating?**

Well that's where the **procrastination equation** comes into place:

Motivation = (Expectancy \* Value) / (Impulsiveness \* Delay)

This is just a mathematical way of saying that to increase your motivation and thereby decrease your procrastination, you have to increase expectancy and value while decreasing impulsiveness and delay.

But you could also argue that you can formulate it like this:

Procrastination = (Impulsiveness \* Delay) / (Expectancy \* Value)

But let's go with the way he presents the equation in his book:

Motivation = (Expectancy \* Value) / (Impulsiveness \* Delay)

&amp;#x200B;

**Expectancy** is a number that represents your confidence in your ability to reach your goal.

The problem is that if you have low expectancy and are afraid of failing, you will not even try and thereby create a self-fulfilling prophecy.

To fix this Piers Steel has 2 recommendations:

1. **Success spirals:** Set achievable goals and then your results will create motivation for more effort, which will create new results and so on.
2. **Vicarious victory:** If you read autobiographies, or connect with successful people in other ways, you'll see what's possible through them and thereby raise your expectancy.

But be careful about having too big expectations.

You need just enough optimism to believe the task is possible, but from there on being more optimistic will just make you believe you have to work less and thereby decrease your motivation.

&amp;#x200B;

**Value** is a number that represents how valuable you perceive the goal to be.

If you want to increase value then Piers Steel has 4 recommendations:

1. **Create ""Approach goals"" instead of ""Avoid goals"".** So you should be saying ""I want to be healthy"" instead of ""I don't want to be unhealthy"".
2. **Self-praise and give yourself rewards.**  We begin mixing up our goals with the rewards. An example of this is that we associate working with making money and are thereby motivated to work.
3. **Find work that is intrinsically valuable.** This one explains itself
4. **Remember the bigger picture of what you're doing and why it's important.** It's the difference between a bricklayer who sees himself building a wall and a bricklayer who sees himself building a Cathedral.

&amp;#x200B;

**Impulsiveness** is a number that represents our sensitivity to delay.

The more impulsive we are, the less likely we are to delay gratification, and this will, of course, be worse the longer the delay is.

To fix this Piers Steel has 6 recommendations:

1. **Remove all temptations.** Hide the TV remote, close all Social Media apps and throw out the junk food.
2. **Be healthy.** If you get good sleep, food, and exercise, you will have more willpower to override your impulses and pursue your goals instead.
3. **Punish yourself if you don't do what you should do.**
4. **See temptations abstractly.** If you want to avoid cookies, you can just think of them as round objects.
5. **In your mind, you can pair the image of the desired temptation with something undesirable.**
6. **Get habits into your daily life**, because habits are something you just do no matter what, and the fewer moments of choice, the less you will procrastinate.

&amp;#x200B;

**Delay** is a number that represents how far away the reward is.

If someone else has decided the date of the final deadline, then the only thing you can do is to create deadlines up to the final deadlines.

But with all this said, it's still important to strike a balance between procrastinating and being too disciplined. Many workaholics regret not having more moments of goofing off and many industrious students regret studying through the Spring break. But if you are still reading this, then most likely you are procrastinating too much and have to do something about it.

If you are procastinating too much then I would really like to help you! I'm a Life Coach specializing in helping people with   Procrastination issues!

I do one Free initial Coaching Session of 60 minutes, so I can determine if you are commited enough and you can see if you like me as a Coach. Write a comment here  saying ""I'm interested"" or PM me if you are interested 🙂

Some people don't try and build new habits, some people focus on them but don't have a system in place, and some people don't like their system or it takes too much time.

I have spent many hours creating my Habit Tracker Spreadsheet, that I'd like to share with everyone here.

My aim whilst creating it was that it should be quick and easy to use. After all, nobody wants to spend too much time trying to track their habits - because there's not enough benefit, and frankly it's a bit boring.

The tracker will take you under 2 mins a week to fill out, and everything else is done automatically for you. It includes:

- Simple summary (when you just want a quick overview of how you've been doing)
- Detailed summary (lets you compare individual habits and shows you things like your ""success rate"" or how long you spend on each habit)
- Various graphs (if you just want to want to see the data in the summaries displayed visually)
- A ""snapshot"" of your current habits and your targets (also allows you to see whether you have completed each habit today or this week)
- The ability to change the targets of your habits, and add / remove habits

If you would like to check it out, feel free to do so here:

https://thespreadsheetwiz.com/habit-tracker-spreadsheet

I hope some of you find it useful, and I'd love to hear what you think about it :)"

He then complained about how his team were always reactive and making bad decisions. He didn't see the connection.

We live in a culture that celebrates sleep deprivation and being busy, without knowing whether it's actually bringing results or not. We have so many options that it becomes difficult to say ""no"" and…in the end we work hard and not accomplish much…

One thing that made a massive difference for me and my business is to sit down for 5 minutes and plan my day in advance. It doesn't take a massive effort – the recipe is essentially to look at your calendar to know what events will take up your time (and how much time you have left), and then set 2-3 wins for your day. These aren't tasks, but actual things you want to accomplish by the end of the day.

When you take 5m to step back and look at what's important, you do two things:

1. You are strategic and look at the big picture instead of focusing on whatever's next
2. You are proactive instead of reacting to other people's emails, texts, emotions…

Try it out, it will make a massive difference!"

0,"This Is The Right Way To Restart Broken Habits Habits can be disrupted fairly easily by vacations, sickness, or just plain forgetfulness. After a pause, many people have a tendency to make a critical mistake - they try to pick up right where they left off.

If you built up to running 5 miles a day then missed a week over a boozy vacation, it can be tempting to think you should go for a 5-mile run when you get back home. But, if you break a streak, picking up right where you left off previously will require much more motivation, so it makes it less likely you'll do it, and if you do get out there for the run it will feel harder, elicit aversion, and leave you less likely to continue with your habit in the following days.

You have to rebuild this habit, which benefits from a **kaizen** approach. Go back to where you started, give it a few days, then build up again to where you were. You’d be surprised how easy it is to get back in the swing of things - and how many more habits you can maintain - if you give yourself a few days to build back up.

But my argument is, wherever you are now - was a dream for you 3 or 5 years back. So instead of always being a cycle of more, stay.

Enjoy what you have achieved. You don't need to compare and aim for something big now - take your moment to enjoy what you have achieved. Stay in that zone - maybe for 3 months or 1 year. You can always go back to wanting more - but enjoying what you earned is also important, rather more important."

Since doing this I've noticed a shift in my attitude. I feel a lot more focused and content. When I started the journal, I wrote intentions like, ""to meditate for at least 15 minutes"", ""to feel productive,"" or ""to go with the flow."" After a couple weeks my intentions included more goal-oriented activities, e.g. ""to buy a domain,"" or ""to read"".

I've done to-do lists before, but this feels different. Instead of ""getting stuff done"", I'm enjoying the process. And since I've been trying to get in touch with my own needs - rest, security, peace, etc - many of my intentions are simply, ""I intend to have \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ mental state today"". This means I no longer feel ""lazy"" or unproductive, because relaxation and rest are often written in my intentions.

Personally, I've enjoyed writing intentions much more than goals or a to-do list. It seems that goals can make me feel unsuccessful, depending on whether or not I achieved them. And to-do lists are more goal-oriented, while intentions are process-oriented. And I've decided that enjoying the process of life (instead of waiting to accomplish goals) is something I want to work on.

That's all. I just wanted to share :)"

0,"Going from zero to hero - what have you done? I’m 26 (M), and feel stuck in life and at a loss where to start in order to feel unstuck. My ambition is to have liberty, have the power to decide what I want to do when I want to do it. It’s a goal I really want to achieve and would like some advice on how to go about doing so. 

The following areas especially are my cause for concern:

* **JOB** \- Since university, I’ve faced a few redundancies and have yet to make the step-up in my career. It just feels like I’m going through the motions and haven’t made the advancements in responsibility and salary that someone who graduated 4 years ago would expect to make  
 
* **HOME** \- Ever since graduating from university, I’ve lived at home. I desperately would like to leave but can’t make my mind up about renting or buying in London (don’t have enough money for the latter)  
 
* **FRIENDS** \- Don’t have a core group of friends who can appreciate me for me, and push me to want to better. I also find it difficult not to compare my situation to friends who ‘seem’ to be doing great in their lives  
 
* **PARTNER** \- Never been in a long term relationship and I’m scared I won’t find the one. I have the perfect picture of my ideal woman but am yet to find her. I don’t have an issue of confidence with girls, I just haven’t found someone to make a real go of things with. The fear is as time goes by, I’ll rush myself into a relationship that is not for me and then end up with a messy situation. I've gone down vicious cycles like downloading dating apps and ashamedly messing around with escorts because of a sense of feeling unwanted - it's depressing!  
 
* **MONEY -** I only have one income source and am not sure what to do generate multiple sources of income. Reflecting on the money I’ve saved to date makes me annoyed. To be clear, i’ve tried to be creative and think of ways to entrepreneurial but nothing has come of it  
 

I’ve tried exercises like visualisation, affirmations, meditating …. but nothing has really hit home. My question is what can I do?/ What have you done to turn your life around from a perceived rut to one that is blossoming in all areas. Should I be tackling the areas above individually? Is there one area that I should focus on which could trigger a domino effect for the others?

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks!"

&amp;#x200B;

*""To survive, you must try -- lest you wish to die""*

We've all experienced procrastination. In fact, you might be procrastinating as you read this. There are a ton of long-term solutions -- that are completely viable, by the way -- like building better habits and stronger self-discipline. But what if you just want to motivate yourself to do something *right now,* right *this second?!*

Here's a simple solution. It's a *5 five step process* I created and it has yet to fail me. If you want to do something but have zero motivation then simply follow this process. Go through each step sequentially and by the end I promise that you'll be ready to be productive (at the very least it has always worked for me and the few people that I've shared it with.)

&amp;#x200B;

# 1. Engage In 10 - 20 Minutes Of Physical Activity

What I mean by this is to do something outside for 10 to 20 minutes (taking a walk, practicing yoga, or playing basketball.) You're prepping your mind for deep focused work by activating your body and soaking up some of that good ol' vitamin D.

**Example:** I'll play basketball for 10 minutes (nothing extreme or strenuous, just some shooting around.) And then I'll lay out in the sun for another 10 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. Environmental Declutter

Clean your immediate workspace. Clear it of all distractions and external stimuli. This includes extraneous notes, books, and other junk. If your desk is in your bedroom then you better make your bed and put away any loose clothes. Decluttering your environment will also declutter your mind and make it so the only thing you can physically focus on is your work.

**Example:** I clean off my desk of *everything*, wipe it down, and give the area a quick vacuum.

&amp;#x200B;

# 3. Task Prioritization

Focus on only one thing at a time. Clear your mind of all the things you have to do to complete your task, and get rid of that to do list that also has unrelated tasks on it. Put pen to paper and write down the exact, specific *one* thing that you are going to work on. I find that it helps if I take this to the extreme and don't even listen to music or use other external stimuli.

**Example:** Let's say I have to write an essay. This means I have to: perform research, organize my thoughts and get an idea of how I'm going to write, write a rough draft, edit the rough draft, add citations and sources, have someone review the draft, make final changes, and then finally upload it. If I'm just starting, this is a lot to focus on! So I'll literally take pen to paper and write down ""Number one: Write a rough draft, stream of consciousness style."" And that's *ALL* I focus on, I don't even think about the other steps until I'm finished with step one.  


# 4. Start Imperfectly

Commit to doing your task imperfectly. It can be overwhelming to think of the final product and how much work needs to go into your task before it's finished. So realize that you don't need to start perfectly. It's easier to review and improve upon an imperfect product than it is to create a perfect one the first time through.

**Example:** Instead of writing an essay perfectly the first time through I write a rough draft. And the rough draft is very sloppy. I write it in a stream of consciousness style with no thought of proper grammar, paragraphs, or transitions, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

# 5. Schedule Evaluation Points

Set a reminder for 1 hour after you start your task. Once that reminder hits take a 5 minute break and evaluate yourself. How are you feeling? What's your motivation level like? And, most importantly, Do you want to keep going for another hour, or do you want to stop? Surprisingly, the answer is usually always ""Yes, I'll keep going for another hour and then evaluate myself again."" Simply knowing from the onset that you only have to commit *at most* 1 hour takes a lot of the pressure off, and makes it much easier to start.

**Example:** I evaluate myself after one hour of writing my essay, decide I'll go for another hour, and then return to step 3. I decide that the rough draft is sufficient and move to final edits.

&amp;#x200B;

# That's All!

It's a simple process but after I go through the steps I always find myself doing the task I need to do, even if I'm not motivated. If this is new to you then try it out, I think you'll get BIG results. 

You got this! Good luck!"

0,"There are 3 types of friendship but only 1 that really matters (Aristotle) [https://youtu.be/Y-7p0\_EEOcA](https://youtu.be/Y-7p0_EEOcA)

&amp;#x200B;

*“Between friends there is no need for justice, but people who are just still need the quality of friendship... It is not only a necessary thing but a splendid one”. -Aristotle* 

&amp;#x200B;

Questions such as ""how do I make friends?"", ""how do I know if he/she is a *true* friend?"", and ""should I keep my current friends or are they dragging me down?"" plagued my consciousness and were the source of much anxiety for many years.

Thankfully, our good friend Aristotle had an interesting take on friendship that presents one possible answer to all these questions. He classified friendship into three separate categories. Using these categories we can analyze our own social life and forge friendships that bring ***true*** happiness.

# 1. Utility

The friendship of utility. These friendships are based on mutual gain between two parties. For example, a relationship between work associates or business partners.Generally these friendships do not last long because once the utility is exhausted the friendship will also dissolve.

These friendships are weak, and not genuinely fulfilling.

# 2. Pleasure or Accidental

The pleasure based friendship. These types of friendships have an emotional origin such as similar interests or circumstances.

Examples include people in the same college and fans of similar sports teams.

These types of friendships do not last very long because our interests and circumstances usually change over time.

They may be pleasurable, but are not exactly the most fulfilling because they are not based on a deep understanding and appreciation of the other person.

# 3. Good

The third category is what Aristotle calls the friendship of the good. These friendships are based on the mutual appreciation of the virtues that the other person holds dear.

In other words, you've built a genuine relationship with the person that is not based on simple utility or the appreciation of temporary interests. However, keep in mind that these friendships *do* include the benefits of both utility and pleasure based friendships as well.

In a friendship of the good, you truly appreciate that person for who they are, as they do you. These friendships take time and mutual effort to grow, but they are the most long lasting and most genuinely fulfilling.

# That's All

Ultimately, all three categories of friendships are valuable in their own right and it just depends on your personal situation and the context.

But, the friendship that matters the most, and the one that is going to bring you the most joy in your life, is ultimately the friendship of the good.

&amp;#x200B;

0,"[Advice] Three practical techniques I used to overcome social anxiety [https://youtu.be/uq\_vuSWMKyo](https://youtu.be/uq_vuSWMKyo)

&amp;#x200B;

***""****Relationships of the heart are the most beneficial thing to any man""*

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone. I, like many of you, have suffered from social anxiety for a very long time. 

I'm not sure exactly why, nor that it really matters, but it just happens that I get excessively nervous, constricted, and scared during social situations.

*Or at least I used to...*

&amp;#x200B;

These are the three techniques that I used to get big results in decreasing my social anxiety over time.

# 1. Emulate Confidence

In other words, emulate the *physical actions* and mannerisms of people who don't have social anxiety. So, if you're out and about, think about what someone who didn't have social anxiety would be doing. What would they look like? What actions would they take? How is their posture? Where are they looking? What is their stride like?

The idea is to almost *reverse engineer* your social anxiety. Let your body experience what it feels like to have the appearance of confidence. Remember, **""as you think, so shall you become""**

For me, this acted as a sort of priming, so that I acted the part, and then I eventually became the part.

# 2. Loosen up Physically

People who are uncomfortable and nervous are usually more physically rigid and stiff. So you're going to do *the opposite* of this. Jump around, move your body from side to side, and shake out your shoulders and hips.

Do this as many times as you need to, and *don't worry* about looking foolish. I don't care if it's in the middle of the sidewalk, a party, or a crowded Starbucks. You'll be surprised how few people will even notice, and how much better you'll actually feel.

The idea here is to literally *shake out* some of your anxiety. Just remember the quote, **""loose body, loose mind.""**

# 3. Practice in Non-consequential Situations.

One of the best ways to overcome social anxiety, just like anything else (at least for me), is through *practice and repetitions.* 

So what do I mean by non-consequential situations? A non-consequential situation is any daily situation where you can practice your confidence and social skills without any real detriment to you if you appear awkward.

Next time you're going through the Taco Bell drive through, smile and make some small talk with the cashier. Drop them a compliment and ask them how their day is going. This sounds stupidly simple but it's effective.

Literally every store and every cashier is an opportunity for you to practice being more outgoing, more confident, and more assertive. Remember that, especially if your social anxiety is moderate to severe, you have to **start somewhere.**

# That's All

These three techniques may not work for everyone, but they certainly helped me chip away at my social anxiety piece by piece. And I'm betting that after a couple of weeks, you'll see BIG RESULTS as well.

Hope it helps! :D"

0,"How to overcome fear, my major paradigm shift *""Fears are nothing more than a state of mind"" - Napoleon Hill*

For a long time fear was my dominant emotion. It controlled my thoughts, feelings, and, most importantly, my actions. But, through a series of very *painful* and *disquieting* events I eventually tamed my fear and (for the most part) am no longer plagued by its forbidding effects.

&amp;#x200B;

The following points form the basis of my *paradigm shift:*

# 1. Fear &amp; Anger

When you're sitting around a campfire and smoke is blowing in your face do you get upset at the smoke? You may get agitated and move to the opposite side of the fire, but you certainly do not become angry with the smoke itself.

In the same way, you cannot become angry with your fear. Anger that you are afraid is not only unproductive, but adds fuel to your fear through the replication of negative emotions. Becoming angry with your fear is the same as being angry with the smoke while you're standing in its way and pouring gasoline on the fire. This is a mistake I used to make all the time.

When you experience fear, take a deep breath and accept your fear, do not fight it.

# 2. Fear Is A By-Product

Following this analogy, smoke does not appear naturally, on its own, out of thin air. Rather, smoke is a by-product of combustion. In the same way, fear is a by-product of a lack of *experience* and *time*.

Generally, you're afraid to do something simply because you haven't done that thing or haven't spent enough time doing that thing before. This was a very important realization for me because I used to think that my fear was random and uncontrollable. In actuality it's very controllable because my experiences are something that I have a vast amount of influence over.

# 3. Experience &amp; Time

Contrary to popular belief, you do not conquer your fear through false bravado or mind-set tricks. They can be useful in the short term, but your fear will eventually return if you rely on them.

The only way that I've found to permanently conquer fear is to gain more experience in and spend more time doing the very thing that I'm afraid of. It's both paradoxical and stupidly simple. The hardest part is just accepting it and moving forward.

# That's All

**Overall**, here's my advice for someone who is about to start something new and is experiencing fear:

Don't try to conquer your fear beforehand. Instead, take a deep breath and push forward. Realize that fear is a *by-product* of a lack of *experience* and *time*, and work to gain that experience as fast as possible. After some time spent doing the thing, you'll come away with a renewed confidence and an obedient rather than oppressive fear.

&amp;#x200B;

At the very least this has helped for me. But I think you should expect BIG results if you apply this thought process to your life as well."

0,"Our war is spiritual. Our depression is our lives. “We’re the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War’s a spiritual war… our Great Depression is our lives. We’ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we’d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won’t. And we’re slowly learning that fact. And we’re very, very pissed off.”

&amp;#x200B;

This is a quote from fight club. A movie so prophetic that I get concerned every time I watch it. Concerned because I don’t know if a movie can predict future events, or if the movie itself is the catalyst for the emergence of those events.

&amp;#x200B;

Modern societies seem unable to offer the level of meaning demanded by our complicated nature. We seek and we find and we seek again and we find again. In the end, we rarely discover answers that can truly satisfy our curiosity. The next question is bigger than the last one and the lack of proper explanations creates an intellectual and spiritual void.

&amp;#x200B;

This void becomes an extension of our persona and manifests itself in behaviors that connote moral relativism and a deep anger towards our creator.

&amp;#x200B;

The more dissatisfaction we experience, the more the void grows bigger.

&amp;#x200B;

It grows bigger until it transforms into a merciless pit that will swallow us all.

&amp;#x200B;

The dawn of consciousness was either a mistake or a gift.

&amp;#x200B;

No one can really tell.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a gift because we are now able to be in absolute control of our world and keep extending our control to other areas of our solar system. It was a mistake because we have no idea why we do all that.

&amp;#x200B;

The aimless pursuit of goals, dreams, and visions can keep one alive, but it doesn’t necessarily make this life pleasurable.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the day, every mature person realizes that our war is spiritual and that our depression is our lives.

&amp;nbsp;

It was called The Habit Journal.

&amp;nbsp;

It started out as a piece of paper, folded twice and tucked into my back pocket. I would walk around with it to remind me of the simple actions I wanted to take throughout the day. I would then tick them off at the end of the day. The pieces of paper became the journal and the rest is history. 

&amp;nbsp;

Anywhoo...I just wanted to share an invite to our community over on Facebook. Each month I’ll be sharing a free printable version of the Habit Journal which you can download (July is up there already), print out and use to track your habits over the course of the month. You’ll also be able to share your progress, ask questions and generally find some accountability for your daily actions.


&amp;nbsp;

Hope this is ok to post here!

0,"How does becoming clear on how you feel helps you breakthrough it? Clarity is power in all aspects of our lives and emotions is no different. Often our minds play games on us deceiving us to believe that we feel a certain way whereas the reality is something different. 

One valuable habit that I developed over years was how to understand and become clear on how I really feel. 

When we become clear on our emotions, we have the power to change our actions and behaviors to get the results that we really want in life. 

So here are three questions that help you understand how you feel and what you could do to change it: 

Whenever you’re experiencing an unhealthy feeling, ask yourself: 

**1. How do I feel?** 

This question gives you an opportunity to slow down the roller coaster of emotions that drags you into a down spiral. This also gives you a chance to acknowledge how you feel which is also important in giving your feelings an outlet to avoid suppressing them. 

On the first attempt your answer might be something like, I feel angry, or I feel frustrated. 

This is how things look like on the surface. Now it’s time to get to go a bit deeper to figure out what your true feelings are. 

**2. How do I really feel?**  

Our minds need some time to absorb situations and to let things settle in before the mental and emotional fog dissolves and you could see things clearly. This is why you need to ask yourself a question that allows you to better understand your emotions. 

So asking yourself how do I really feel encourages you to connect to your heart and this is where the truth really lies. Whereas on the surface you could be feeling angry, deep down you could be feeling stuck and unable to make an important decision at work or back home. 

If we don’t give our emotions a healthy outlet and we keep running away from it, it will shape into a new emotion that causes us pain. 

**3. What can I do now to change this?** 

I mentioned before that our emotions are signals from our hearts and minds that we need to change something. This is why understanding our emotions is the first step towards changing our actions. 

So let’s say the you found out that anger is nothing but a new outlet to your frustration of not making the decision you know you have to make. 

In this case, you need to dig the real reason why you don’t make this decision. Fear of the consequences of your decision could be what’s keeping you stuck. In this case you could be thinking of strategies and tactics that reduce the risks of your decision. 

Clarity is the power of understanding and simplifying to take action and move forward. Do something different today to get a new result. 

Hope this helps and feel free to ask any questions

In our attempt to overcome obstacles and achieve goals, we could be delusional to think that it’s one big decision that’s gonna make the biggest difference in our lives. Ask anybody who ever achieved a great success and s/he will tell you that it’s never one decision that got her/him to success. 

The little decisions we make everyday about when to wake up, what to eat,  what kind of people we welcome in our lives, what kind of ideas we feed our minds are what really shoes our lives. 

A decision whether you express how you really feel to your loved ones or whether you continue to hold your emotions prisoned between the walls of your chest. A decision to show up to yourself and do the work that gets you to where you really want to go. A decision to go the extra mile that gets you all the rewards that others won’t get. 

So think today and everyday how your whole life could be changed by making one new decision. The day you know how to get out of your comfort zone to make extra decisions is the day you whole life changes. "

Even the least stressful work after a week is noticeable because the body feels tired and needs to relax. Here are some simple relaxation exercises that you can do every day. After completing them, do not suddenly get out of place to not feel dizzy.

**1. The position of the eagle**

Start by sitting on the floor in a Turkish style, hands resting on your thighs and your palms facing each other. Taking a deep breath, spread your arms from side to side until they are parallel to the floor. You should feel the stretching around the ribs. Releasing the air, hands return to their starting position. Repeat the exercise 5 to 10 times.

**2. The position of the pigeon**

We are still sitting cross-legged, and when we inhale, we raise our hands so that a 45-degree angle is created between them and the head. This position ideally extends around the ribs and chest. Then we exhale the air leaving our hands. Repeat the exercise 5 to 10 times, breathing each time deeply and raising your hands smoothly as if you were spreading your wings.

**3. Pigeon position modified**

We modify the pigeon position by flexing one leg backward. Hands spread parallel to the floor, lift it up as in the previous step, and then leave. We make 5 -10 deep breaths, then change the leg and repeat the exercise.

0,"Step 5 to figuring things out: It’s time for a new strategy! I’m excited that we have come to the fifth and the final step that marks the beginning of your journey to transform out of anxiety, depression, fear, and any other unhealthy emotional hurdle that keeps you from winning in the game of life. 

For the past four days we have covered a number of specific steps to guide you on how you can discover the unhealthy emotional pattern that gives you pain, the true reason of your struggle, and what these emotions cost in all areas of your life. 

**The four steps that we’ve gone through so far are:**


**The first**: Becoming clear on what you want to achieve out of this journey. 

**The second**: Your current mental and emotional situation. 

**The third**: The obstacle that has been keeping you stuck in that destructive emotion that long 

**The fourth step**: Th strategy that you’ve used so far to meet your emotional needs, and how it’s costing you much 


Today in our last step we are going to look at how you can come up with a new strategy to meet your emotional need and how your whole life could be changed once you develop this new strategy. 

In our previous posts we’ve made it abundantly clear that most of the time what we think to be the problem that’s causing us the pain is nothing but a symptom for a deeper problem that’s causing us the real pain. 

More likely the anxiety, and/or depression you’re challenged by at the moment won’t go away by over eating, taking drugs, or killing time in front of TV. But it will definitely go away when you find out what’s been causing you the real pain and finding away meet your emotional need. 

The way to do this is by asking yourself: 

**What could be a healthy alternative to meet my emotional need for love, connection, feeling especial and needed, feeling important, etc …?** 

**What will I gain when I use this healthy alternative instead of my previous destructive behavior?** 
**How my life would look like in all areas?**

One of the very first things I did when I wanted to change my life is to be very clear on what will I get out of this all. 

For example: 

physically: I’ve become in the best shape I’ve ever been in my life (almost perfect weight and healthy) 

Socially: My relationships with my family and friends have never been better.

Emotionally: I feel the love, connection, and appreciate of everybody around me. I feel how much they appreciate the new (real) me that’s been lost for far too long. 

professionally: Everyday is a bless and an opportunity for me to give and be the best I could to people I serve at my work. 


Being very clear on how your life would look once you commit yourself to making this change adds to the momentum that you’ve built before. It gives you better reasons to do the work and become the person you know you could be. 

You see we could meet our need for love and connection by being depressed or by giving and helping people. we could meet our need to feel important by being harsh and angry or by being open and loving. We could get more money by being liars and crocks or by being genuine and offer real value to others. 

There’s always an unhealthy and disempowering way to meet our emotional needs, but there’s also a another healthy and empowering way to fee how we want as well. 

The choice ultimately remains ours. circumstances are nothing but a trigger that carries with it a challenge and an opportunity. Our responsibility is to choose which one to pay attention to. 

I truly hope that these five steps have given you an opportunity to know more about yourself. People could spend their entire lives without even truly knowing who they were, or what their lives were about. 

I genuinely invite you to take a deeper look at your life and see the opportunity in every situation instead of being distracted by problems. I respect whatever difficult circumstances you’re facing, but also know that you’re bigger than any circumstance that could ever happen. 

The minute you make a committed decision to working things out is that minute your whole life could change. There’s no shortage of resources once you show up and do the work. 

Please let me know if you have any questions. I’d also love to know if this has inspired you and guided to take a step forward towards a new life and a new you. "

This is a very simple way to finding out who are you and who do you want to be, which is a very essential step when it comes to transforming yourself out of any unhealthy emotions such as anxiety, depression, anger, or overwhelm. These were some of the destructive emotions that challenged me throughout my entire life.
In this post I will be writing about the first step and in the next few posts I will follow up with the other four steps.

**step 1: Become clear on the destination**

The first thing I noticed about myself is that I had no sense of direction in my previous life. I’ve always been an ambitious person, but didn’t know exactly what I wanted to accomplish. As a result of this unclarity I’ve spent the majority of my previous life pondering in different directions trying to find my path amongst thousands of traveled roads.

At first I thought I was the only person, or at least among the unfortunate ones, who have absolutely no idea what they want to do with their lives. But I found out that it was the other way around. I was sharing the same boat with the majority of people who had no clue what they want out of their lives. Whereas the fortunate minority are the ones who are already designing their dream life.

Up till that point my ambition has taken me to amazing places, but I was busy living others’ dreams rather than my own. I mentioned in my previous posts that it was my parents dream for me to join medical school. They - and I - have been disappointed when I didn’t get the high school grade that qualifies me to study medicine. So the next logical step - that’s how it looked like back then - was to go for graduate school and turn to academia as an alternative dream.

The mistake that the majority of us fall in is that we have no clear sense of direction to where we want to go in life. The danger of this is that when we don’t plan, we become part of others’ plans. The lack of a clear destiny is an easy prescription to an unfulfilled life and probably a miserable one. This applies to everything including the life we want to have, the people we want to become, the relationships we want to build, and the health we eat to enjoy.
The best place to start transforming your life is to become as clear as possible on the results you want to achieve. This means to start with the end in mind. If you want to transform yourself, your relationship, your body, your business, or any other aspect of your life, start with where you want to go.

So go ahead, bring a pen and paper, set down in a quiet place and answer the following questions:

**Where do you want to go?**

**In three years from now, where do you want to be?**

**what kind of person do you want to become?**

**what kind of life do you want to have?**

**what kind of relationship do you want to be part of?**

If you’re not sure what do you want in your life yet, it’s ok we’ve all been there and no need to judge yourself for it. One of the keys to moving forward is to make things as simple as possible to do. Often we have great goals, and a lot of energy, but then we end up doing nothing because we get caught up in the details and the complexity of execution. So this time make it nice and simple.

Start with what you already know and build on it. This is particularly a good strategy when you don’t have the pieces of the puzzle together yet.

One more tip that helped me a lot in laying down the foundation to my new life is to use other people as a resource. In other words if there’s anybody you look up to, think about:
What do you like about them? their personalties? relationships? life?
What would you like to have from their personalties? relationships? life?
For example, you like somebody’s self confidence, decisiveness, commitment, communication skills, etc… You might like a couple’s playfulness, deep sense of connection, mutual respect, trust, good familial ties, etc.. (you get the idea)

Write these things down and please note that the intention of looking at other people’s lives isn’t out of envy, but it’s a way to have a compass that helps guide you to your destination.

Keep working on this list until you’re happy with the list you came up with. Try to
 get this done in one or two sessions because if you take any longer, you might start to procrastinate (again).
You just finished the first and the most essential step in designing a fluffing life that you fall in love with everyday.
Tomorrow we’ll work on the second step towards figuring yourself and your life out, which is “current state of being”."

**(Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results)**  

A quick recap on the three steps we’ve gone through so far: 

First Step: Becoming clear on what you want to achieve out of this journey. 
Second Step: Your current mental and emotional situation. 

Yesterday we finished the third essential step pf finding out what’s the obstacle that’s really holding you back from achieving the results you want. That could be a belief that you adopted over the years as a result of your misinterpretation of past experiences.

Now that we have our hands on the real cause of the pain, we will begin to look at what strategies have you been using to distract yourself from facing the real problem. This is what we do to meet our need instead of working out the real problem. 

You can find this out by asking yourself the following: 

**what have been I been doing so far to feel loved, appreciated, needed, excited**, etc (whatever emotional need you found out you focus on the most from previous steps). 

For example, somebody might have decided to meet the emotional need for love and connection by staying depressed most of the time. This way people could sympathize, offer love and help. Another person decides to escape the pain of not being able to love and be loved by doing drugs or over eating. A third chooses anger to feel important and have others comply to her or him. 

Then ask yourself: 

**What has this destructive behavior (current strategy) cost me in all areas of my life** (physically, emotionally, mentally, financially, and socially)? 

You see what really got me to change and get out of depression, anxiety, and anger was that I realized that their cost was way more than their benefit. Here are some things it cost me in my past life: 

1. Physically: I was at the lowest point of my weight (38 KG/83 LBS), weak, exhausted, very low energy, get sick most of the time 
2. Emotionally: Easily provoked, angry, irritated, frustrated, impatient, sad, unable to love or give to anybody including myself
3. Mentally: unable to focus, low productivity at work (actually I didn’t even go to work most of the time), no creativity, foggy. 
4. Financially: Too many absent days (cuts off my cheque), low productive and for performance delayed my promotion and higher salary
5. Socially: my relationships were all over the place with my family, my then fiancee, and my friends. Low quality relationships, no genuine love, caring, and connection. Even when I was present, they felt like I was absent. 

The key here is to be as detailed as possible in your description of how this destructive behavior is slowly tearing down your life. This will create momentum and give you the energy to commit to taking action. 

Tomorrow, in our final step, we will be looking at how to come up with an empowering alternative to this destructive behavior to meet your emotional needs in a healthy and empowering way.

I have been trying for awhile now to practice mindfulness and, really, potentiate conscientiousness. Less regarding minor anxieties, but rather being TRULY present.

However, I have recently really noticed that I seem to always hold tension in my face and, specifically, my shoulders. For some odd reason,  though, I have always subconsciously felt.. tense. Maybe not tense...uncomfortable may be a more appropriate word? I don’t know...my personality is generally easy going, (good coping mechanisms, however, occasionally uncomfortable in interpersonal relations — which I truly believe everyone feels to some extent).

I used to never noticed this or even have thoughts of any level of self-critique (or other-critique for that matter!) in such an analytical way. I was always an extrovert, and I’m curious if there is any level of correlation between sensibility and how such senses of acknowledgment come to reason. 

Off-tangent...but anyway, I often notice myself seeing/feeling said tension. For those of you who have worked toward greater mindfulness or self-improvement, has this ever been experienced and what are your tactics in controlling and overcoming?

0,"Step 3 to figuring things out: what’s holding you back 

In the past two posts we’ve become clear on two essential steps in our journey to transform out of anxiety and depression. 

The first: Becoming clear on what you want to achieve out of this journey. 
The second: Your current mental and emotional situation. 

Today our third step is to find out what’s holding you back from achieving the result you’re after. So let’s explore what obstacle(s) are holding you back from getting what you want.

When we’re faced with a mental and emotional challenge such as anxiety or depression, we think that this is the problem we have to handle. Whereas most of the time this is just a cover up for the real issue that needs to be dealt with. I know that so many people get so much attached to the labels of different kinds of anxiety or depression which makes the issue sound like a physiological problem, but if you continue to dig deep behind all of that, it will come back to a different problem than the one on the surface. 

Here’s how you could discover the root of your pain, the real reason that holds you back from getting the result you’re after. 

**Disempowering beliefs**

After we have a number of experiences in life, we start to organize the results of these experiences into an emotional idea. This emotional idea, which we call a belief in turn guides many of our decisions and actions unconsciously. The issue is that gradually these beliefs could become a hinderance towards what we think we’re capable and incapable of doing and achieving. 

For example, a lady or a guy who seeks a love relationship but things don’t work out a couple of times. This person could adopt a belief that s/he is unworthy of love because s/he gets rejected or left behind. As a result this person might never seek a true loving relationship to avoid rejection altogether. S/he continues to think about that and becomes depressed or anxious because s/he functions from a mental and emotional state of “I’m unworthy of true love”. 

In this case depression or anxiety is nothing but a symptom to a deeper problem.This person needs to make the distinction that s/he doesn’t have a fulfilling relationship YET because s/he hasn’t found the right strategy, and not because s/he is “unworthy”. The minute this distinction is crystal clear, everything changes. 

Here’s how you can find out what disempowering beliefs guide your decisions, feelings, and actions. Ask yourself: 

**1. What do I believe about myself/this situation/this person? (this depends on the situation you’re in and the result you’re after) (for example, if you’re depressed, you could have a belief that you’re pathetic, worthless, or you’ll spend the rest of your life alone)**

**2. What makes you think that? (for example, if you think you’re worthless, what makes you think that? what happened that got you to develop this belief about yourself? did somebody tell you you’re worthless? did you have a number of relationships the ended not so well? In other words what was the first point in time that got you to come up with this conclusion? (this is one of the most essential parts because this is mostly where the real issue lies)**

**3. What do you get out of indulging in this unhealthy emotion and thought? Do you use this emotional pattern of sadness, anger, indifference, overwhelm to distract yourself from making a bigger decision that you’re scared of making? Do you use depression to get other people’s attention? Do you get anxious  and stressed to feel important and to have others listen to you? Do you use drugs to forget how lonely you are? Do you eat to have a sense of achievement that you don’t get at work?**  

 You see too often we keep complaining about destructive emotions and how much of a problem they are. We TRY to get over them and get rid of them. But deep inside we’re actually using them as a shield to protect us form facing our fear. The moment we become aware of the dangerous game we’re playing against our own good, this is the time we could have the advantage of making a decision and taking action to turn things around. 

Tomorrow, we’ll look at your current strategies for overcoming these destructive emotions and how effective you’ve been so far.

0,"Good diet for stess: products that reduce stress levels As we know, stress is an inseparable part of our lives. Some feel it in a smaller and some more. What it depends on? There are many reasons. Certainly, this is related to our childhood and atmosphere at home. Parents should teach us how to react in stressful, unforeseen situations. However, often parents themselves cannot adequately cope with stress. In such cases, we must take control of our reactions to stressful events. We are responsible for our own lives. Not our surroundings, family or friends. There are many methods. Which help in the fight against stress. We will start with the basics or the diet. We are what we eat so carefully choose the products we eat. In this article, you will find products that reduce stress levels.

**Tip #1**

First, follow the principle of regular food. Thanks to this your body will benefit better from the nutritional values ​​contained in the food. Eat about 5 meals a day. Thanks to this, you will take care of the correct metabolism in your body as well as reduce the risk of weight gain. Frequent food (this should not be confused with overeating) regulates the metabolic process.

**Tip #2**

Now let's go to the merits or the list of products that help us [cope better with stress](https://perfect24hours.com/15-best-tips-on-how-to-relieve-stress). Undoubtedly, you should start with blueberries. They look similar to Polish berries. They are one of the healthiest fruits in the world. They contain vitamin C, which helps in the fight against stress. Blueberries are also rich in fiber. It regulates the level of sugar in the blood. Its elevated level contributes to a greater sense of stress.

**Tip #5**

Also, pay attention to the turkey. It contains a valuable amino acid, the so-called L-tryptophan. It increases the production of hormones (melatonin and serotonin) responsible for maintaining a good mental state. It eliminates sleep problems and accelerates the regeneration of the body. L-tryptophan also has sedative properties. Avoid fried turkey. It's best to bake it.

0,"An App for Discovering of your Psychological 'Shadow' Hello Everyone,

I developed an app based on Carl Jung's concept of the 'Shadow' (i.e. the deeply ingrained negative patterns in your automatic thoughts.) It's available for FREE for the next 7 days on the Android Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ievolve.androidapp.iEvolv&amp;hl=en

I have been using it on myself for the past few months and it has helped me become more self-aware and psychologically disciplined. This is my first app and I'd love to get your thoughts and feedback on it =)

The app is called ""iEvolve - Defeat the Darkness Within"" (long and vague title, I know.) It is basically an objective-based app, which sends reminder notifications with response buttons, which feed a Line Graph on the Status page, giving the user the ability to track 'violations' of their objective.

The introduction page provides the user with the basic concept of the 'Shadow.' The user can select one of the 3 preset objectives, or define their own custom objective. The preset objectives (negative traits) are Bitterness, Arrogance and Greed. The objective pages provide brief description of each objective/trait. Once activated, the App sends notifications (which can be customized in settings) reminding the user to monitor their automatic thoughts for 'violations' and providing the ability to track 'violations' of the objective on the Status Page via a Line Graph.

Here's a feature video showing how it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq6Mkvs--vk

Personally, I have found that during times of vulnerability or high stress, my 'shadow' tends to pop-out and take control of my thought process. I have certain negative tendencies which are ingrained very deeply into my psyche and last year I discovered them, after I became familiar with Jung's concept of the 'Shadow.' The purpose of this app is to help myself (and hopefully others) become more aware of the 'shadow' and begin to integrate it methodically.

Hope it helps =) Please let me know what you think. Thank you."
0,"Step 2 to figuring things out: Your current state of being 
Yesterday we took the first step in the journey to finding your true self and transforming your life out of anxiety and depression. The first step was to become clear on the destination that you have for yourself, your life, your relationship, or any other area you want to change. 

Today we will be looking at our current situation in life. This makes it clear on where we are and where we want to head towards. 

Today’s step is exploring and understanding your current state of being. Our state of being is the mental, emotional, and physical condition we have ourselves in. In life we experience a number of emotional, mental, and physical states. This could be healthy states such as excitement, enthusiasm, curiosity, love, and joy. It could also be unhealthy states such as depression, anxiety, stress, anger, fear, overwhelm. 

However for the majority of us we have a couple or a handful of states that create repeated patterns which we experience weekly or daily. The importance of these patterns is that after some time they form an unconscious operating system that directs the majority of our decisions and actions. So when we become aware of these patterns and understand them, we could have the ability to change our behaviors and to produce the results we’re after. 

Let’s assume that someone is challenged with anxiety and depression. The result s/he wants to achieve from yesterday’s step (this is the answer to the question of where do they want to go from yesterday’s exercise) is to feel joy, love, and passion in their lives. The next step for this person is to find out more about her/his current pattern of emotions. In order to find this out, you could ask yourself the following questions: 

**1. How do I feel everyday/every week?**

**2. What are the set of emotions I experience on a given day/week (the most frequent ones)? (e.g. anger, sadness, overwhelm, anxious)** 

**3. what do I think about when I’m experiencing these emotions? (e.g. the amount of work I have to do, past unsuccessful relationships or experiences)**

**4. what do I tell myself when I’m experiencing these emotions? (e.g. “I’ll never be able to finish this work on time”, “I’ve never had a successful relationship”, “nobody likes me”, “i’m pathetic”, “I’m lonely and I’ll probably be lonely for the rest of my life”**
 
**5. How does your body translate this emotion? how do you breathe? how do you move? how do you walk? what’s your tone of voice?** 

Write the answers to these questions down and keep them safe long with the answers to yesterday’s answers. 

Now you have two blocks of valuable information. The first is your end destination and the second is where you are at the moment. 

Tomorrow we’ll look into what’s holding you back from getting to your destination until now.  "

For the past nine months, I’ve been living in a time loop. When she broke up with me, I tumbled down a rabbit hole of bipolar disorder. At the time, I was halfway through rehab from surgery I had received for a torn ACL and menisci in my left knee. Having restricted mobility that limited my physical activity was detrimental to my mental health because I’ve always used sports as a coping mechanism. Not knowing what to do, I closed myself off and allowed my emotions to build. When I couldn’t hold them in any longer, I’d hit myself to release the stress that had built up. It was a really confusing span of time for me because my mood was the victim of sporadic changes that I didn’t understand. One second, I’d be laughing with friends, and literally five seconds later, my mind would wander to the past and fill my head with spite and I’d have this dying urge to hit myself in the head.
 
Being bipolar really screwed with my life because it held me back from doing a lot of the things that I wanted to. There were times when I felt an intense desire to stop breathing, times when I aggressively lashed out at others because they said something that made me irrationally angry, times when I experienced extreme lethargic episodes laying in bed not doing anything, followed by all-nighters typing madly away on my keyboard trying to get assignments done hours before they were due. There was one morning, around three on a school day when my parents had to drive me to the ER because I was having a panic attack—struggled to breathe, experienced chest pains, lost mobility—and seriously thought it was a heart attack. I felt okay by the time we arrived at the hospital. I felt ridiculously ashamed when the doctor told me I was physically healthy and instead directed me to talk with one of their mental health support workers. Simply put, I was disgusted with myself. Disgusted with the monster that bipolar disorder had turned me into. The reason I describe bipolar disorder as living in a time loop is because there were so many times these past nine months when I genuinely felt like my mental health was improving. But each time I felt improvement, I’d relapse back into another spiral of undesirable emotions. The worst part is, I think there was a point in time when I stopped trying to resist the mood swings, a point when I gave up. A point when I gave up, and started using my condition as an excuse. An excuse for my work ethic, for my deteriorating academic performance, for the way I treated the people around me.
 
And that was wrong.
 
I realized this past week that drowning in my own self-pity wasn’t going to get me anywhere. I had refused to open up to other people and I had refused to listen to the people who tried reaching out to me—so it was up to me to get on my feet again and turn my life around. The things that helped me:
 
1) One of my teachers recently showed us a documentary titled “Touching the Void.” If you’re searching for some motivation, I would really recommend watching it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4LD9vQ3Fjs. My surgeon had warned me against running to delay the effects of osteoarthritis in my knee, and this documentary made me feel ridiculous for being so willing to sacrifice something I love simply because someone else told me to. So instead of indulging myself in misery, I was inspired to get up on my feet again (participating in runs!) and if you’d like to read a bit more of my story and support a great cause, give this a read: https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/walking-to-fight-juvenile-arthritis/. I decided to start the campaign because it’s rewarding to know that you’re making a difference in the lives of people who have it so much worse than you.
 
2) I bit my lip and listened to the people trying to help me. My dad had been on me for being “lazy.” Each time he lectured me, I would retort that he didn’t understand my situation. And of course he didn’t, because I had refused to open up about what I was going through. When I finally accepted that I was merely using my mental health as an excuse for my poor work habits, I became more aware of my actions, and sought proactive change. Sometimes, other people see things in our behaviour that we’re oblivious to. It’s good to stop talking and listen every once in a while.
 
3) Accept that the past is the past, and move on. If your mind wanders to the past because you’re constantly reminded of it by things you see on social media, cut off contact. It’s difficult, but life moves on—with or without you.
 
4) Write down small goals at the beginning of each day or the night before in a journal. Take on bullet journaling if you’re into that, or simply jot down a to-do list. At the end of the day, take a look at how much you’ve accomplished. Keep a record of your lists and observe your progress. If you find that you’re not getting anything done, maybe your goals are too ambitious. Start with baby steps. Stick to a schedule for a few weeks, and you’ll have developed great habits. I’m still struggling with my own time management, but it’s a goal we can work towards together! If you watch the documentary I linked in the first tip, you’ll recall that Joe uses time pressure to motivate himself. If you set a timer for your work periods and breaks and discipline yourself to abide to those pre-determined time intervals, you’ll be more productive.
 
5) Do something everyday that you enjoy and makes you feel accomplished. For me, that’s being active, and I find that taking a bit of time out everyday to workout or even just stretch does wonders.
 
So for nine months, I was caught in a cycle of self-doubt, self-hate, and general negativity towards myself. You need to be the person lifting yourself up so I challenge you to change the way you talk to yourself. Positive self-talk only! It wasn’t until last week that I really started seeing myself recover from my mental struggles—and it took a full nine months, and I'm still not 100% there, but the finish line is in sight. You don’t see it, but you’re constantly working towards recovery everyday. For every step back you take because you relapsed, hold yourself accountable and take two steps forward. Recovery’s kind of like an iceberg. You’re stuck at the surface for the majority of the ride, but one day you’ll wake up realizing that you’re able to hold your breath for long enough as a result of all the months you’ve been working towards self-improvement. That’s when you get to dive into the water and embrace the entirety of your recovery. Good luck!"

0,"The first step I took to figuring myself and my life out 

The journey to the safe shores of my true self wasn’t an easy one, but I enjoyed it and more importantly I learned a lot. So I decided to write this post to anybody who wants to go on the same path, but isn’t sure where to start.  

This is a very simple way to finding out who are you and who do you want to be, which is a very essential step when it comes to transforming yourself out of any unhealthy emotions such as anxiety, depression, anger, or overwhelm. These were some of the destructive emotions that challenged me throughout my entire life. 

In this post I will be writing about the first step and in the next few posts I will follow up with the other four steps.

**step 1: Become clear on the destination** 

The first thing I noticed about myself is that I had no sense of direction in my previous life. I’ve always been an ambitious person, but didn’t know exactly what I wanted to accomplish. As a result of this unclarity I’ve spent the majority of my previous life pondering in different directions trying to find my path amongst thousands of traveled roads. 

At first I thought I was the only person, or at least among the unfortunate ones, who have absolutely no idea what they want to do with their lives. But I found out that it was the other way around. I was sharing the same boat with the majority of people who had no clue what they want out of their lives. Whereas the fortunate minority are the ones who are already designing their dream life. 

Up till that point my ambition has taken me to amazing places, but I was busy living others’ dreams rather than my own. I mentioned in my previous posts that it was my parents dream for me to join medical school. They - and I - have been disappointed when I didn’t get the high school grade that qualifies me to study medicine. So the next logical step - that’s how it looked like back then - was to go for graduate school and turn to academia as an alternative dream. 

The mistake that the majority of us fall in is that we have no clear sense of direction to where we want to go in life. The danger of this is that when we don’t plan, we become part of others’ plans. The lack of a clear destiny is an easy prescription to an unfulfilled life and probably a miserable one. This applies to everything including the life we want to have, the people we want to become, the relationships we want to build, and the health we eat to enjoy. 

The best place to start transforming your life is to become as clear as possible on the results you want to achieve. This means to start with the end in mind. If you want to transform yourself, your relationship, your body, your business, or any other aspect of your life, start with where you want to go. 

So go ahead, bring a pen and paper, set down in a quiet place and answer the following questions: 

**Where do you want to go?** 

**In three years from now, where do you want to be?** 

**what kind of person do you want to become?**

 **what kind of life do you want to have?** 

**what kind of relationship do you want to be part of?** 


If you’re not sure what do you want in your life yet, it’s ok we’ve all been there and no need to judge yourself for it. One of the keys to moving forward is to make things as simple as possible to do. Often we have great goals, and a lot of energy, but then we end up doing nothing because we get caught up in the details and the complexity of execution. So this time make it nice and simple. 

Start with what you already know and build on it. This is particularly a good strategy when you don’t have the pieces of the puzzle together yet. 

One more tip that helped me a lot in laying down the foundation to my new life is to use other people as a resource. In other words if there’s anybody you look up to, think about: 

**What do you like about them? their personalties? relationships? life?** 

**What would you like to have from their personalties? relationships? life?** 


For example, you like somebody’s self confidence, decisiveness, commitment, communication skills, etc… 
You might like a couple’s playfulness, deep sense of connection, mutual respect, trust, good familial ties, etc.. (you get the idea) 

Write these things down and please note that the intention of looking at other people’s lives isn’t out of envy, but it’s a way to have a compass that helps guide you to your destination. 

Keep working on this list until you’re happy with the list you came up with. Try to get this done in one or two sessions because if you take any longer, you might start to procrastinate (again). 

You just finished the first and the most essential step in designing a fluffing life that you fall in love with everyday. 

Tomorrow we’ll work on the second step towards figuring yourself and your life out, which is “current state of being”.

0,"Is life a dream? The other day I was in a field with two close family members having a chat under the sun. It was a beautiful spring afternoon and we were debating the idea of aliens. When all of the sudden I remembered something, I recalled that I was actually sleeping and this was all a dream. The moment I did so I looked closely at the fabric on my clothes, the feeling of the breeze running through my hair. It was all too real. But my two cousins were agreeing with me, “you should go” they said, “you’ve got a life to live.” I got a rush of excitement, a nice afternoon turned lucid dream and I began flying around like Superman. Then I woke up, in what we call “the real world.” That entire morning I spent contemplating life, is this real? The dream almost seemed more real than this. Who am I really? Why am I here? What is life? Is this like inception? A never ending cycle of dreams?


This all seems extremely philosophical but it gets good. Now I thought to myself, the only thing that remains is my consciousness. It doesn’t matter what’s real or not, I’m conscious! In my dream I was conscious and in this “reality” I’m just that, conscious! So I thought of an interesting way to look at life. By seeing life this way you banish fear, anxiety, stress and many other awful mental conditions that seem to plague our society.


Think of your life, like a dream. If you were in bed at night dreaming and you were conscious of the fact that nothing was real and you would wake up soon, would you ever be embarrassed? Could you be stressed? Would you beat yourself up for mistakes you’ve made?


The great saint in India, Muktananda, was asked, “What is real?” He replied, “What is real is that which never changes.” Your consciousness! The silent observer in the back of your head that just sees everything take place, whether it be in a dream or in what we call real life. Wayne uses the lovely example of your body, and how every cell in your body changes every 7 years. Meaning the 12 year old me was made up of completely different stuff than the now present 19 year old me. But I remain. The silent observer just witnessing everything.


That is the true self. In our culture we are taught to identify with our bodies, our career, our talents, our accomplishments. Jim Carrey calls depression “trying to keep up an image in the world.” Whether it’s a self image or a reputation with others, we try so hard to be someone we are not. If you are the car you drive, and some steals it, than you become “nobody.” If you identify with your smooth complexion than the moment wrinkles start to set in you lose your identity.


The ego is nothing but an idea in our minds of who we are and who we should be. When deep down you have a calling, a purpose to create something powerful. Regardless of how good in looks in the eyes of others. Think of life as a dream. Don’t take things so seriously. Of course there are others in this dream, they have their own purpose, there are consequences to everything. To dedicate your life to the ego will lead you down a path of disappointment and sorrow.


How do we get rid of the ego? Simple, live your life in service of others. Put your own worldly pleasure and reputation aside and do something for someone else. I will leave with this second half the peace prayer of Saint Francis.


O divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek
to be consoled as to console,
to be understood as to understand,
to be loved as to love.
For it is in giving that we receive, 
it is in pardoning that we are pardoned, 
and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.

0,"How to Choose What Books You Should Read If you have read a few books in your lifetime, you probably how important it is to read.
However, how can you choose the books that will be helpful to you? Here’s how.

**1. Choose a relevant topic**

If you want to build a business, don’t read about poetry. This one is pretty obvious but I just wanted to point it out just in case.

To do : choose a topic that’s relevant to what you want to learn

**2. Check the reviews**

If you want to read a book, it’s most likely that the people who have already read it were lookng for similar information. What does this mean ? It means that if they liked it, you probably will.
This is why you should check the reviews, to see if that book has helped the people who have a similar issue. Of course this is not a foolproof metric, but in most cases, it will reveal if the book is any good.
Where to find the reviews ? The best sites are Amazon and Goodreads.

To do : before reading a book, check the reviews.

**3. Check the author**
Reasearch the person who wrote the book. Read a little bit about his biography and career. This can give you an idea of how credible the author, and therefore the book is.

To do : before reading a book, research the author.

**4. Consider who’s recommending the book**

I got this one from Valuetainement (great channel for entrepreneurs by the way). Sometimes people tell you to read a certain book. It can be a friend, a familly member, and even an influence on youtube or on a blog.
When you see someone recommending a book for you, consider wether or not that person knows what he/she’s talking about. If you see that person as a credible source, why not accept the recommendation ?
I have personally read some books that were pretty long just because someone I trust recommended it.

To do : read the book if it’s recommended by someone who’s credible.

That’s how you can choose what books to read. I do this for most of the books that I read, and till now, most of them were pretty good.

This isn’t a foolproof tactic but it will definitely help you choose the best books for you."

0,"The Confidence Paradox We all know at least one or two people who carry a vibe that is so attractive and fun to be around. We know this because when we meet these people they make us feel comfortable, they make us laugh, they keep things interesting. They’re enthusiastic and charismatic. I’m talking about confidence. But not the big ego pride that some people have where they do nothing but brag and talk down to people. Real genuine confidence. I have an interesting way of looking at confidence, especially coming from a guy who has dealt with shyness, social anxiety and insecurity his entire life. I’ve had my fair share of embarrassing moments and self doubt. But recently I have been able to completely eliminate nearly all fear and replace it with unwavering courage and confidence in my self. I achieved this personal transformation in a seemingly counter-intuitive way. Just keep in mind we are not the human bodies and persona’s we are constantly being judged by and judging. We are so much more.

--

1 — DO NOT PICK AND CHOOSE
I stopped caring about the GOOD things people thought about me. I basically gave up on both ends of the spectrum, good and bad. Here’s the thing, when you say to yourself, “I don’t care what others think when it’s bad cause they’re just stupid anyways, but I looove when people compliment me and appreciate me” you are inviting a world of problems. Think of this way. I want to catch shrimp with my big net in the bottom of the sea, I’m going to have to grab everything that’s down there. Including plants fish, mud, rocks etc. Meaning: IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE GOOD YOU MUST CARE ABOUT THE BAD AS WELL. When you care about opinions there’s no way to filter out a certain kind of opinion anymore than there is a way you can filter only shrimp when you drag your net through the water. You’re gonna catch whatever is in there. the ego is a package deal. So stop caring all the together. Don’t let the good get to your head anymore than the bad. Let people think what they want to think. Try your best to view the good as equal to the bad. They’re all simply opinions at the end of the day. Whether they are good or bad is a human construct. We see a counter top where we prepare our food, and our cat sees a lovely bed they can lay on. Everything in this world is subjective. So stop caring and you find an amazing sense of freedom and release of tension. You’ll be yourself because there’s no more need to impress or convince.

--

2 — STOP TRYING 
Confident individuals don’t try, they go with the flow, they follow their heart. They do what their heart guides them to do. They have lost their ego and so bliss and flow is their natural response to life, and that is what we strive for! Consciously or subconsciously we want to live a life free from concern, acting without fear, we want happiness, we want confidence and courage. But we try too hard. I believe there is a constant flow of good energy, happiness, confidence and love but we create resistance but chasing after these things. 

For example, imagine you’re at a market and you see an attractive guy or girl. The thought of approaching them and trying to talk makes you super nervous. You’re friends bugs you so much to the point that your finally talk to them. As you approaching you’re trying really hard not to be nervous. You’re focusing heavily on not looking nervous and appearing confident. You say hello, they notice how much you’re sweating and shaling. With fear for their life they ignore you and speed walk away. 

If you would have simply not cared about the outcome. Not cared whether or not they thought you were attractive or cool. If you would have not cared even what language they speak. If you would have just been your true self, and not put this person on such a pedestal, you would have paradoxically appeared more interesting, confident and attractive. 

I actually learned recently to just be myself when I make Humbowl videos as an example. I used to try real hard to put my thoughts into words that people understand, and as a result it would appear disingenuous. Once I relaxed and let myself mess up, let myself ramble on and speak the “language” of my mind rather than try to filter it into generalized concepts for everyone. I appear more confident. Like I’m having more fun, and paradoxically, people understand me more!

So quit trying to be happy and you’ll find happiness. Quit caring about what others think, and chances are you’ll feel much more comfortable in your own skin and in turn become much more confident. Confidence is easy, it’s natural.

0,"10 Useful Life Lessons to Give You a Head Start **1. Experience without deep analysis is useless**

I’ve seen a lot of people who have plenty of experience. They’ve been to a lot of places, talked to tons of people, worked at many jobs, yet their level of thinking didn’t change at all. Why ? Because despite their experience, they never took the time to make conclusions from their trials and errors.
If you compare someone who learned a lot of stuff just out of awareness, and someone who’s had plenty of experience but who lacks the proper thinking, the first one will easily be more successful in life just because the first one will avoid the mistakes even if he never experienced them, whereas the second one will keep making the same mistake because he won’t get the lesson behind it.

**2. Don’t trust people too quickly**

I think you already know this, so just take it as a reminder. A lot of people make the mistake of trusting too fast, opening up way too quickly than they should. Well, I think the lesson is pretty obvious here, don’t do that.

**3. If you wait for something to be happy you never will be**

I’ll be really happy when ____ fill in the blank. This is a huge mistake that most people, including me, make at some point in life. There’s this illusion the somehow, a person, an event or a material possession will suddenly make us happy.
Let’s pretend it’s true for a moment, how long do you think that happiness is going to last ? Not very long I guess. You have to understand that the only way to be happy is now. Of course, I’m not asking you to just ‘be happy’ that’s just not very logical. What I’m saying is that you should stop waiting for something to be happy, that’s it.

**4. Wishing for something won’t make it happen**

A goal without a plan is just a wish
Saying you really want something or talking all day long about it won’t make it happen. This is more of a reminder than a lesson, but still, it’s useful to remember it. If you want something, make sure you take action, even if it’s minimal at first, but the important thing is to move, do something.

**5. Not giving up actually works**

You’ve heard it a thousand times, you see it everywhere, and you think to yourself — that’s just bullsh*t, real life doesn’t work like that — Well, guess what ? It does. If you don’t believe me, go and read the stories of the people who are really successful nowadays, a good example is steve jobs.
The main reason why people aren’t doing what they want to do is because they give up too soon, then they start blaming life as if life was a person. If you read the stories of people who are insanely successful, you’ll notice that one of their common traits is persistence.
Sometimes, just reading about how some of these people were living makes you wonder how they didn’t go insane. If you want something, don’t give up on it.

**6. We often make excuses just to feel better**

We’re all guilty here. Sometimes you want to do something but you jump on the first chance you get to justify why you couldn’t do it. You know, you say you don’t have time but you watch TV for 3 hours a day. You say you don’t have the money but you can’t wait to buy the latest smartphone that you don’t need. You say it’s impossible when someone you know with half of what you have has done way better.
We’re really good at making excuses and thinking about why we can’t do it. The problem with that is that these excuses seem real and legit when in fact, it’s just a way to escape the reality which is that we’re afraid to put in the effort and fail. And here everyone is different. Some are afraid of what people will say, some are afraid of wasting all that time for nothing, some are just lazy so they try to make it look as if they can’t do it.
I think you get the point, even if your excuses seem real, they’re just a way to justify your inaction, so start taking action instead.

**7. Social norms are bullsh*t**

One of the biggest and most common fears that all human beings on the planet share is the fear of what other people think. Think about it, the world as you know it, and the social standards that you were conditioned to pick up were created by people who were no smarter than you, they were just born before you. Does that make it right ? Not really.
If you think maybe 40 years ahead and imagine yourself 40 years older. If you look back on your life, now that you’re way older, does it matter to you what people were thinking of you when you were younger ? Did it do any good if they thought you were good or bad ? Not at all.

**8. The real risk is not taking any risk**

Mark zuckerberg said it well, and he’s actually right. We’re always so afraid of taking risks, so we just stay in that comfort zone that we think will somehow protect us and make us feel safe. Here’s the thing : you’ll never feel truly good about yourself if you never take any risk.
You have to stop being close minded and start considering new possibilities. Try new things even if you might fail. If you never take risks, you’ll never have anything remotely close to success. You have to try and step into the unknown, and even if you fail, there are people who were in situations that were more difficult, with fewer options, but they managed to create success because they take risks and always try to find a way out. Remember, no risks = no success.

**9. Until now you probably never realized what you’re really 
capable of**

You know when you hear those inspirational talks and they say ‘you can do it’ and you start thinking they’re crazy or something ? Well, they’re not. Unlike what some people might say, the reality actually shows you real proof that even the average person is just average because of his own self-limitations.
Our limits are self-imposed because from childhood to adulthood, we are bombarded by beliefs that aren’t ours, and we’re forced to think that that’s ‘reality’. You want an example ? Have you ever tried to tell your friends or family about a big ambition of yours ? Maybe you want to invent something, become famous, or really rich. What do you think their reaction will be ? It’s more than likely that they will make fun of you. Do you know why ? It’s because their model of reality was imposed by society, and they didn’t hesitate to take it as the absolute truth.
Even if there are a lot of people who broke this common belief that we’re all meant to be ‘normal’ and that’s just a polite way to say mediocre by the way, most people still manage to find excuses like I mentioned in #6 by saying that the successful are lucky, that it’s destiny, or that they’re super talented. When you think like that, how can you possibly succeed when you think that success is related to stuff you can’t control ?
The bottom line is that you can do way more than you think, and I’m saying it seriously, not just to motivate you or anything. It’s a proven fact

**10. The majority isn’t always right**

“Wrong does not cease to be wrong because the majority share in it.”
― Leo Tolstoy
This quote makes the point really clear. You have to understand that even if 99.99% of people believe in something, it doesn’t mean in any way that it’s right. This belief itself, the belief that if a belief is accepted by the majority then it must be true is widely accepted, but it has been proved to be false countless times, so it’s a great example.
In fact, the majority of people is often manipulated by the media, war propaganda, ads on TV, and the list goes on.
There are even more example that you’ll find in the history books. Countless inventors whose inventions have greatly revolutionized our lives were believed to be crazy and made fun of. Just do the research and you’ll find out yourself.
“Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to reform (or pause and reflect).” 
― Mark Twain"

I’m excited for ya!

A little background before getting started, 

So who am I? What have I done with anxiety and depression? 

Well, long story short, 

I’m just a joyful and a loving person who is extremely passionate - maybe even qualified obsessed over human emotions. Since young, I’ve been curious about human behavior, emotions, and psyche and how we can use this knowledge to tap into the power of living up to our highest potential. (I think this is clearly illustrated in my previous posts) 

How did I go about to discover who am I?

The journey of discovering my own identity began at young age. When I was in high school my friends and classmates seemed clear and confident on what they wanted to do with their lives, and the kind of lives they want to have. I’ve always wondered wether they got this confidence at home from their families. I felt that having your parents as role models makes the task of deciding your career and your future less of a challenge. 

I’ve always admired my parents perseverance and hard work to give me and my sisters a better education and life. I remember thinking as a child that I didn’t want to work that hard to make ends meet like my parents. I didn’t want to spend a lot of time working to provide even the most basic stuff in life. I remember telling myself if I can have better education, my life is going to be a lot better than my parents’.

So, I did good until my grades in high school didn’t qualify me to study medicine in college. Med school was the natural choice for people who wanted to have respect and a good quality life. My mom was very sad the day my grades came out. I translated her sadness as my failure. I was very ashamed of my result and all of a sudden my dreams of having a better life became further and harder. 

The day I joined college to study education was one of the worst days in my life. I thought of myself and everybody who was their in the class with me as a complete failure. We were a group of failures who weren’t good enough to be accepted into the club of smart people who studied science and medicine. 

I did a great job in my study at college and my grades qualified me to not only find a great job, but to also receive three scholarships that funded my graduate study abroad. Despite all of my success, I’ve always viewed myself as the failure that didn’t get enough grades to join the faculty of medicine. 

Besides my issue with study and grades, I’ve always felt lost and not sure about who I was or what I wanted in life. 

For years I tried to pretend that my anxiety and depression aren’t there. I tried to find reasons to justify my feelings. At times I even thought it was a personality defect that needs to be fixed, but I didn’t know how to fix it. 

I tried to fix myself more than I tried to work anything else around me. I never even questioned people’s ideas or suggestions of how my life should be. The more I tried to do that, the harder it got. Then I tried to completely ignore my feelings and just to pretend it’s not there. This almost drove me insane more than anything else, because I was constantly lying to myself and to others. This is what I call “emotional pretending” and it’s the worst kind of acting you could ever do. 

When I got frustrated after trying to work this out in different ways and not getting the result I was looking for, I decided to give up and just keep my life going the way it was. Then during a work trip abroad something happened and it rocked my whole world. The amount of fear I had at that time was more than I’ve ever experienced in my entire life. The intensity of fear and pain forced me to either accept this to be the reality of my life or to step up and do something to save myself and my life. 

 Since I made this decision years ago, my life has been going from good to better in a way that I could’ve never imagined. 

———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Following are the five emotional stages I went through to discover my true identity and they are followed by five principles that hugely impact our identity formation over years of our lives. 

Often when we get stuck in life we could pass through these five stages of emotions. The intensity of these emotion varies from a person to another and from a situation to another. Some people are more aware of these emotions and they know how to utilize it to get what they want in life. Whereas others ponder in these emotions for a while until they find a way out. Unfortunately, there are also people who live their entire lives without having a clue what their lives were even about. 

Before we get to the 5 stages, let me answer two questions that could be going on in your mind now: 

The first is “can I do that?” “Do I know who I am?”  

The second question is? “what would I benefit from finding out my true identity?” “ what’s going to be different in my life after I finish this process?”

The answer to the first question is “yes” you are capable of doing anything that you believe you could do. I believe that ALL of us have the answer to this question deep inside, but some people choose to dig this answer out while others leave it buried down underneath daily routines and busy life. If you give yourself the gift of taking some time to yourself to sit in a quiet place, you will find out who you are and you will come up with the answers to this question. 

The benefit that you will get by answering this question is the ability to understand and then change your behaviors and actions to get the results you want. When you find out what makes you who you are, you find out the reason you do what you do, and once you have the ability to change the way you define yourself, you have the ability to change the behaviors that get in the way of living up to your fullest potential. 

Now that we got the answers of these two questions out of the way, let’s begin with the five emotional stages that you could pass by to find out who you are. 

1) Confusion and loss 

This is how the majority of us start to feel when we are not sure of what’s goin on, we feel this subtle discomfort, we feel unhappy, but we don’t even know what’s it all coming from. This feeling of confusion slowly creeps in and steals clarity and balance from our lives. We start feeling confused about a career, a relationship, or any other circumstance. The next thing we don’t even know who we are. 

The intensity of our emotions about our lives circumstances impacts our perceptions of everything including ourselves and our identities. During this time of our lives if we’re asked directly “who are you?”, the only answer we could think of is either surprise, shock, or a blank stare. 

People could spend various amounts of time in this stage. I know I spent high school and early college years in this stage. During those years I’ve always been uncomfortable and unclear on what I wanted to do with my life. I had no sense of clarity or direction. 

When I was in high school I thought I wanted to study medicine like my classmates, but deep inside I knew this wasn’t what I truly wanted. I tried to hide my confusion and loss by pretending to seek a dream that wasn’t mine.

Confusion is a sign that we need to do something to gain clarity back. Confusion is the first signal that you receive to notice that something isn’t right. 

So if you’re in the confusion stage of your life, I invite you to get a pen and paper and ask yourself: 

“What am I confused about? Is it my career? is it my relationship with my partner, my mom, my dad, or a friend? is it an important decision that you need to make, bu you don’t know how to?” 

So, the first step is to get clear on what you’re confused about. 

The second step is to ask yourself:

“Why am I confused about this?” “Is it because I need more information to get more clear? or because I need to talk to somebody to get clear on understanding a situation or behavior?”

The third step is to find out what you can do to get past confusion to gain clarity, make a decision, and move forward. 

So, ask yourself:

“What can I do now to get clear on what I must do to resolve this situation?” Write down all the ways or solutions you could do to get clear and take action. 

Fourth step, start with the solution that gets more results with little effort (the 20% that gets you the 80% results). 

For example there were many things I could’ve done back in high school to resolve my confusion about studying medicine. Talking to friends who already joined medical school, reading about medicine, volunteering to any medical associated roles, all of this could’ve given me a better feeling and understanding of studying medicine. 

2) Battle 

When confusion isn’t resolved in the right time, it could turn to a feeling of inner emotional battle. We start to contemplate things and ask questions that we’ve never asked ourselves before. Our energy is often consumed by the emotional fight between feeling that we need to do something, and fear of the unknown. we’re torn and stuck in the no man’s land; we have so much pain and yet we’re too scared to do something to end our pain. 

To set ourselves free from this emotional battle, we need to find sufficient answers to our questions, and take action to move ahead. 

So if you’re currently stuck in the battle stage and you want to do something to free yourself, here are some steps to guide you forward: 

First, write down the issue that’s causing you the emotional battle, this could be a problem with your job, marriage, losing weight, making a business decision, anything that giving you this sense of emotional fight over what to do. 

Second, write down the things that you’ve lost and the things you will still lose if you continue in this battle mode without resolving things. So, let’s say, you have a problem with your marriage or intimate relationship, the cost of this problem could be things like: 

Emotional pain
Constant disputes and fights with partner 
Sleepless nights for fear of loosing him/her
Inability to focus at your job 
Loosing money bonus at work for poor job performance 
If you have children, negatively impact children mental and emotional wellness 

Third, write down the things you’ll gain in all areas of your life when you resolve this issue. Back to the same marriage example, some of the gains could be: 

Having a soul level relationship with spouse or partner 
Deep and genuine feeling of love and joy 
Deep emotional connection with partner 
Emotional strength to give to others 
Dedication and passion at work 
Having the mental and emotional clarity and peace to focus and give your best at work and at home 
Confident, strong, and kind children who have amazon loving parents as a role model 

Fourth, intensify the feelings of lose and gain, make them so vivid and powerful in your mind that you have no other option but to get up and act to resolve things. 

One mistake that I did back when I was in high school was that I stayed for far too long in this battle stage. I asked myself what if medicine isn’t the answer, what if I want to be something else?”. 

However, I didn’t utilize the emotions of lose and gain. I didn’t think about the cost of keeping my battle unresolved on the longterm, and I didn’t consider the reward of clarity on the trajectory of my life. 

The result was that my emotions evolved into the next stage of crazy loops. 

3) Crazy loop

The common mistake that most of us do is to treat our emotions as though they were the root of the problem. Whereas, they are nothing but signals for an unresolved problem. 

When we don’t pay attention to our emotional battles, they intensify and could revolve into other emotions that become the way we satisfy our emotional needs. 

This time the inner fight is shaped into a repeated pattern of emotions that perpetuates our pain. The longer we stay within this stage, the harder it becomes to break out of it and the deeper the emotional impact becomes on our lives. 

The repeated emotional pattern varies from an individual to another. For me it was hanging between anger and sadness. Whereas anger represented my need to gain control back and take action to change my life, and sadness represented missing the connection with others whom influenced my decisions more than I did. 

These emotional loops became my new comfort zone where i lived almost all the time. It represented the new limits that I unconsciously set for myself to avoid making any decision or taking any action. 

The mistake I did at that time was that I allowed others to have more control over my life’s decisions than I do. I gave up some of my power to others and I felt angry and weak because of it. 

If you’re reading this and you’re experiencing this crazy loop of emotions, here’s how you can break out of it if you’re ready: 

First, get clear on what your emotional crazy loop is by asking yourself: 

“What are the two emotions that I swing between most of the time?” write them down 

Then ask yourself: 

“What do I get out of these emotions?” “What’s the emotional need this pattern currently meets?” 

I knew I need to have more control over my life, my decisions, and my actions. This is what I got out of anger because when I become angry I feel that I have the strength to claim back my power to make overdue decisions. Anger also was my way to show others my power to make sure their control is limited and so is their influence. 

So “what do you get out of the destructive emotions you currently indulge yourself in?”

4) Peak moment of pain 

We could continue living in the crazy loop stage for a while until an event or an experience breaks our ongoing pattern. For me I lived in this stage for years after graduation and early career until a series of painful events pushed me to the uncomfortable zones of new emotions land and out of my crazy loop. I experienced high and intense levels of emotional pain that forced me to reconsider who I was, the kind of choices I made, and the kind of life I lived. 

This was the peak moment that could either make or break. I was faced with two choices and was forced to choose either to change and expand myself and my life, or to continue to live with pain or the rest of my life. 

Remember that this peak moment of pain could’ve been avoided by a decision to resolve things out before the intensity levels up. The exercise I guided you though in the second stage of “battle” could be used to sort of create this peak moment without having to wait for the tide to throw you off shore.

5) Resolve or revolve 

The decision we make at this peak moment is a critical one for the rest of our lives and the lives of generations to come. Our decision to face fear and to get clear on who we are and what our life is about will shape our lives in a completely different way than if we choose to live in closed circles of destructive emotions, problems, and disempowering life stories. 

It’s also important to note here that when we first try to work things out, we could experience a temporary feeing of frustration. This is normally because we’re at the stage of searching for a strategy that gets us the results we want. However, we could easily get lost in this search for the effective strategy. We might mistakenly think that if our strategy doesn’t work, then there’s a possibility that the problem is unsolvable. 

In this case it’s essential to remember that our primary goal is to resolve our emotional struggle not to prove ourselves right by sticking to a strategy that has proven not to work. This distinction is very important because the clearer we are on the problem we want to solve and the result we want to achieve, the less likely we’ll become distracted by any shiny object in the search journey, and the easier it becomes to maintain our focus on where we want to go versus where we are stuck at the moment. 

Part of emotional strength is the ability to keep going when your strategy isn’t working. your power lies in persistence and flexibility. Once you become clear on the result you’re after, develop enough flexibility to try as many strategies as needed until you get the end you want. 

————————————————————————————————————————————————————— 

Truth of the matter is that none of the previous exercises could get you the most effective results unless you are crystal clear on what you want. The easiest way to know what you want in life is to know exactly who you are. It’s common for people to get confused between the ends and the means in life. 

My parents’ desire for me to join medical school was the means to get to the end result of financial security, social recognition, and a better future for my children. But instead of having me focus on different ways to get security, recognition, and a better future, I was caught up in the means to get the end result. 

They had the best intention and they did it with love, but the focus was on the wrong target. 

There were countless ways I could’ve achieved my goal, had I known what the real goal was in the first place. Medicine was only a possibility among thousand others. Medicine in itself is, like many other professions, requires hard work, dedication, and passion to the study and application of medicine to help elevate others’ suffering. 

Now, I’ll guide you through the ten principles that could assist you to find out who you are, and to get clear on what you want in life. 

Principle 1: Is your identity yours or is it what others have decided for you 

Our identities are developed from beliefs, and past events or experiences of our lives. Now the question here is, did you consciously choose those beliefs and events? have you consciously constructed these beliefs? or were they imposed upon you by others consciously or unconsciously? have you chosen to take part in these events or were they imposed upon you without your consent or choice? 

The majority of the beliefs we get in our childhood are usually the result of others ideas or opinions. They gradually get the emotional association that turns them into an effective part of who we are. Then we start using these beliefs to define ourselves and to set boundaries of what we believe is possible or impossible for us. 

For example, a teacher calls a student “a slow learner” or “retarded”, soon this teacher’s opinion of this child becomes his new reality and he starts to define himself/herself as such. The danger with this is that this personal opinion that was planted in this child’s mind long ago could shape the decisions and the actions this child makes for the rest of his/her life. 

Unless this child grows to believe of one’s ability, this child might never tap into into power to be and do beyond the limiting belief of his teacher. 

You see, the danger of treating others opinions as facts that couldn’t be questioned or doubted is that we could spend our entire lives as prisoners of these beliefs. Social proof is nothing but a source of opinions that we could solicit if needed, but it should never be the reference or the ceiling that keeps us confined. 

Pages of history books are full of heroes and heroines who decided not to listen to what others’s beliefs. They decided, acted, and lived out of their own strong beliefs and achieved what have been once perceived as IMPOSSIBLE. 

So what you could do right now is to find out whether you consciously chose the beliefs that constructed your identity, or whether your beliefs were mainly driven from social proof? 

You could do that by asking yourself:

“What beliefs govern my identity?” “when I think of myself, what beliefs come to my mind about myself, my skills, my abilities, my relationships, my mission in life, my future, my finance, and my health?” 

The next step is to read all the beliefs you wrote out loud, then ask yourself: 

“Which of these beliefs have you consciously developed and chosen to use in your life? And which of them have you unconsciously picked up from others in your surrounding environment (e.g. home, school, club, etc…)? 

How many of all of your beliefs are actually yours? 
 
Circle the ones you have consciously developed and chosen on your own, and ask yourself:

“Does this belief empower me to be my best, and to do my best?” 

if it does, then think of ways to expand the use of this belief in different areas of your life.

If it doesn’t, then ask yourself: 

“How does this belief ruin my life and cost me a lot?”

 Then turn to the beliefs you think you got from outside, and ask yourself: 

“Does this belief empower me to be my best, and to do my best?” 

if it does, then think of ways to expand the use of this belief in different areas of your life.

If it doesn’t, then ask yourself: 

 “How does this belief ruin my life and cost me a lot?” “Was the person I got this belief producing the results I want to get in my life? Does he deserve to be a role model for me? Is s/he the kind of mentor I want to learn from?” 

This step alone will get you in front of thousands of people who live their entire lives without having a clue of who they are, or what their life is about. 

More importantly, it will give you the power of clarity on your identity, which makes it easier to understand your emotions, and change your behavior. 

Principle 2: True capacity vs belief of maximum ability 

Normally we use our beliefs of who we think we are as an indicator of what we are capable and incapable of achieving. The problem is that these beliefs are built upon our interpretations of previous experiences and events in our lives. Now the question is, what if these experiences weren’t all positive? what if you attempted to do something, but things did’t work out for your that time. Let’s say for example a person tried to learn how to swim and during one of the attempts this person almost drowned. This person could use this one experience and develops a belief that he/she is unable to learn how to swim. 

What happened here is that a misinterpretation of a past life event was used to generalize a result of a one time attempt that didn’t work out. However, can we say that this person has any factual reasons that prevent him/her from learning swimming? No, it’s just a belief that was developed and sustained to back up a limitation that this person imposed on him/herself. 

The reality is that everybody could learn how to swim - even the people who were told they were unable for physical issues - so the capacity to learn how to swim is always there. However this person’s ability to tap into this capacity is confined by his belief that he’s unable. All this person needs to do is to shift his belief and find an effective strategy to learn how to swim. 

This applies to many beliefs that we have unconsciously developed over time. A business that didn’t work out, a relationship that bottomed out, an attempt to quit smoking or drugs, loosing weight, not getting the desired results out of these experiences could lead us to inaccurate conclusions that we organize into beliefs. These beliefs become the boundaries within which we live and the frame that confines the maximum of our abilities. 

Hopefully you did the exercise described in principle one, if you did I want you to go back to all the beliefs you wrote down and ask yourself: 

“Which of these beliefs have I developed from previous not so successful experiences?”

“Is it possible that I misjudged the situation to develop this belief?” “How could I have misjudged the situation?” 

“What did this belief cost me in the past, present, and future?” 

“Do I want to continue be directed by this belief?” 

By asking yourself these set of questions you find out whether you’re currently using your full capacity or you’re prisoned by your belief of who you think you are. 

Principle 3: Labels become identities 

One of the dangers of buying into social proof is that we could easily believe in the labels that are generated by individuals, organizations, or systems. 

The day I was “diagnosed” with ADHD was one of the very tough days of my life. When the learning specialist handed me the big file that carried the results of my scan, I felt as if a badge was suddenly stuck to my forehead branding me with “ learning disability “. He said very little words during the whole procedure and his serious and strict attitude gave me an impression that my case was hopeless.

The impact of this procedure is that if we’re not couscous, the label could easily become our new identity. ADHD isn’t a “learning disability”, but rather its a sign that you need to find a more effective way to learn. 

The minute I started buying into my new identity as a “learning disabled”, I doubted my capacity to learn or to produce the study work that was required to get my degree. Even though I’ve always been a good student with very good grades, I allowed the new label to confine me and to rip away my previous achievements. 

The mistake that most of us fall in is that we treat the label as the ultimate truth that shapes our present and future. We trust the labels more than we trust ourselves, and we believe in them more than we believe in our capacities. 

How many great people in the history of mankind were given labels that could’ve kept them captives to limitation and weakness. However, these great people and thousands of others who live amongst us have chosen to uncover their deepest powers and summon their right to shape their lives the way they want not what they were told. 

It’s key to remember here that our identities are constantly evolving and expanding. What seemed to be hard one day becomes our everyday reality as we keep pushing the boundaries that we’ve previously set for ourselves. 

This is your opportunity to push your boundaries back, by asking yourself: 

“Which of the beliefs I wrote is developed from a label that was stuck to me by a person, a system?” 

Ask yourself: 

“How does this belief hinder me from tapping into my full capacity to achieve what I truly want?” 

Now replace this “lie” with your new truth as you write the antithesis of this lie. 

Reflect back to your past and find experiences that support your new truth. 

If you can’t find any experience to support your new truth, the next principle will give you an alternative. 

Principle 4: You’re not a prisoner to your past 

Often we identify ourselves according to our past identities and experiences. This could create limitations that no longer exist in our lives. 

Let’s say for example a person used to consume drugs in the past, but now this person is ready to quit. The challenge here is two fold; first this person has to create a new identity as someone who never even considers the possibility of using drugs under any circumstances, the second is that people around this person has to approach him/her as a different person from the one he once was. 

Associating the old behavior to the new identity is the recipe for failure in changing any destructive behavior. 

People assume that changing a behavior is enough to create the life you want, but in order to ensure achieving the desired result, a change in behavior has to be accompanied with a change in identity. 

Putting your present and future in the box of your past will only get you the results of the past. This allows a picture from the past to miss up your reality and your dreams. 

People and societies might give us a hard time when they keep us hostages of our past misdeeds, but even this changes with time. When you continue to prove once and once again that you’re no longer who and what you’ve been once, there comes a time when people have no choice but to recognize your new identity and approach you with respect for the discipline and commitment you showed in reshaping yourself and your life.

So if there’s a part of your identity that has given you pain in the past, you could take this opportunity to change it right here and right now. Here’s how you can do that: 

Ask yourself: 

“What’s one way I identify myself that I no longer want to use?” 

For example, after I was told that I had ADHD, I used to believe that “I am a slow learner”. I truly thought of myself as someone who’s unable to receive and process information fast. Of course this belief kept me from even trying to do better or looking for a better way to learn faster. 

Shifting my identity to “a fast learner” as well as finding the right strategy to receive and process information in bitable chunks made a huge difference in my learning. 

Then, choose an opposite empowering identity to the disempowering one you currently have. 

So, if you used to think of yourself as “a fat person” only because you couldn’t lose weight, your new identity could be “a health nut” or “a power of energy”. Any exciting and enticing identity that empowers you to get up and do the work with a strong conviction that you are “a heath nut” and no longer a “fat person”. 

You see the power of this exercise is that we all have an unconscious need to maintain consistency with who we believe we are. We think that sticking to our identities is what keeps us anchored in our lives. We feel that if we give up who we are, then we no longer have a clear sense of direction to guide our feelings and behaviors. 

So the challenge isn’t that you can’t “give up” drugs, but it’s that you identified yourself as “a drug addict”. Drug addiction is a temporary circumstance that you could change anytime you decide to. Whereas, being “a drug addict” labels you as someone who has the thoughts, the feelings, and the actions of a drug addict. You have to divorce your identity to be able to change your thoughts, feelings, and actions about addiction and about who you truly are. 

Principle 5: Consistency is rewarded and inconsistency is punished 

One of the very common reasons that keep so many people from changing their identities is their sense of commitment towards what others recognize them with. At the end of the day we all want to be loved and accepted. This is one reason why we continue to act in consistency to past beliefs or views.

For example, let’s say that a person has joined a political party, and at one point in time this person starts to question the ideology of this party. This individual could develop a strong belief that this party doesn’t represent or work for people’s true needs, yet he or she continues to become part of it. The reason is that this individual has associated his or her identity to being a member of the party. 

Leaving the party could mean that this person’s behavior isn’t consistent to her/his beliefs about the party and its ideology. So the person could continue as a member just to avoid being called things like hypocrite, or flakey. so the punishment of the inconsistency between behavior and belief overcame the reward of being true to oneself and claiming a new identity. 

So the decision each and everyone of us has to make is to choose between: 

1. The external reward of being called trustworthy, honest, consistent, woman or man of integrity with the inner pain of knowing that your behavior isn’t who you truly are. 
2. The external pain of being called flakey, liar, untrustworthy with the inner peace and integrity of being honest with yourself and others regardless of any temporary consequences. 

The good news is that the external pain in the second option will change over time when people recognize your commitment to your new identity. 

So, person who’s “a recovering drug addict” could be ridiculed or enticed to get back to being “a dirt addict”. But with commitment and consistency to new identity this person gradually turns into “a health nut” who’s crazy about maintaining emotional and physical wellness. This then changes to “a health expert” who’s approached by others who ask for advice and guidance to replicate her/his results. 

You see, behavior, action, and results speak louder than words. So s/he who shows the most commitment to one’s decision of change is the one that gets all the rewards, even the respect of those who once talked you down.

0,"Seven ways to get rid of stress **Seven ways to get rid of stress**

Today I will show you how to throw away all the stress of your life effectively. It does not matter whether you are stressed daily or only in specific situations - you can make the stress disappear once and for all.

It only depends on you whether tomorrow or the day after you allow yourself to be under stress. This article will give you the opportunity to be calm and relaxed, even in the most sensitive situations.

**1. Smile**

Laughter releases the body from tension; it relaxes the whole body. No one can honestly laugh and feel stress at the same time. Even an artificial smile releases the hormones responsible for well-being, so laugh as often as possible!

**2. Identify stressors and eliminate them**

Take 10 minutes to think about what's the most stressful for you during the day. Write out everything that comes to your mind. They can be people, activities, objects, etc. Anything that causes you stress. Now, looking at each stressor separately, think about whether you can eliminate it. If it is possible, throw it out of your life immediately. Also, think about how you can prevent some situations. I decided that I would choose routes where there are no traffic jams, or I would leave the house early enough always to have time for a meeting.

**3. Take responsibility**

If there are still items on the list and these are things you can not get rid of, change your approach. Above all, take responsibility for your stress. It is not these things that stress you, but you stress them! And that makes a huge difference. If you feel stressed, it means that you let something upset you. You are entirely responsible for this. Standing in that traffic, I knew that my emotional state depends only on me and I decided that I would not be stupid enough to stress something that I can not influence anyway. Remember, if you are stressed, then you allow it. However, you can change this by taking responsibility for your emotional state.

**4. Meditate**

Meditation and relaxation exercises are by far the best way to reduce the stress level in your life to a minimum in the long run. Practicing these exercises three times a week will make you resist stress after two months. This point helped me get rid of the stress of my life. After a while, I was completely calm in times when everyone else was upset. It is even scientifically confirmed that regular meditation or relaxation exercises after some time significantly reduce the average level of cortisol (stress hormone) in the body. Such exercises also have many other benefits, such as improved memory or better concentration.

**5. Use NLP techniques**

Get rid of negative thoughts. We often get stressed even when we are not in a typically stressful situation. This is because we are winding ourselves - we nervously talk to each other, we have only black and unpleasant thoughts. Your thoughts are closely linked to your physiology, and when you think about stressful things, your body is stressed. Your muscles start to tense; your forehead crumples, cortisol is released. By changing your thinking strategy, you can get rid of these negative thoughts and turn them into positive ones. Your body will respond to such thoughts with relaxation and relaxation.

**6. Organize your surroundings**

Whether at work or home - the mess can always stress. We do not know what's where; we are looking for documents when we need them immediately; we lose the most important things. Even if we have not lost anything, the sight of the mess itself creates chaos in the head. Therefore, take care of the order. As soon as you see that your desk or cabinet needs it, put everything in its place. Organize the space in which you work or rest. Your mind will then be able to relax quickly. Relax your mind on a short vacation, as you can read here: [tips to relieve stress](https://perfect24hours.com/15-best-tips-on-how-to-relieve-stress/)

**7. Do one thing at a time**

I remember that once I used to do several activities at the same time. I wrote some text on the computer, in the meantime, I packed something for mailing, watched television from the corner of my eye, and I also talked on the phone. Such a habit can produce a lot of stress in your life. Therefore, always deal with one thing at a time. No stress is just one of the advantages of this approach. When you do one thing at a time, you'll pay the most attention to it and make it faster and better. When you do several things at the same time it's not enough that it will take you a lot more time, it will still be worse quality."

0,"How to improve creative thinking - 7 simple tips Creativity is today an extremely desirable feature, especially on the labor market. Why? Creative thinking not only allows you to create beautiful and valuable things but also to skillfully deal with stressful situations. However, sometimes creative thinking does not come quickly at all. Many of us are known for the lack of original inspiration or so-called ""Heavy thinking."" How to prevent this? Exercising and stimulating creative thinking. Several reliable tricks will help. Here they are.

**Listen to music often**

The first way is to listen to music regularly. Scientific research confirms that music stimulates the part of the brain that is responsible for creativity and emotions. Classical music works best for the brain. It improves not only creative thinking but also concentration and other essential cognitive functions. If you want to increase your creativity, go for classics or jazz.

**Try to write by hand**

Handwriting also has a beneficial effect on brain function. In the computer age, unfortunately, we practice it less and less. However, it is worth to write something by hand from time to time. Our gray cells will work better, and the head will gain more new ideas. The most dangerous thing for the brain is a schematic and routine action that kills creativity and weakens the condition of the mind.

**Walk a lot**

The fresh air, specifically oxygen, also has a positive effect on creative thinking. Therefore, you should regularly walk, run and practice different types of outdoor sports. Also, even light, but regular physical exercise improves memory and concentration.

**Regularly sleep**

It is well-known that sleep is the basis of health and proper functioning, although many of us forget about it and take care of work and study nights. If we want our brains to be a matter, we should sleep regularly at night, but also remember about dozen minutes of naps during the day. A short rest after work will help us relax so that we can think better.

**Learn new things**

Science stimulates brain cells to work, improves intellectual performance and - as you can easily imagine - increases creativity. That is why it is worth continually learning new things, getting to know the world and setting ambitious goals. Our brain requires constant gymnastics to work well.

**Create when you are tired**

Hardly anyone is aware of it, but the most creative ideas are born in our head when we are tired. Why? Because creativity is the result of wandering around unrelated issues. It is therefore worth creating when we are slightly tired but not overworked!

**Surround yourself blue and green**

It has been scientifically proven that blue and green increase mental performance and improve cognitive processes. Thus, they enhance creative thinking. That's why it's best to work in green or blue rooms. We feel less tired then and think better."

0,"Take this dirty dishes challenge, and you'll be much better equipped to tackle huge, real-life problems. Next time you do the dishes, clean the house, or do the laundry (insert your worst nightmare here), I have a challenge for you. Do that frustrating thing in the best way you possibly can. If you’re working on the dishes, turn on some music, focus in, and make sure every single dish is as clean as can be. Skip the dishwasher for this round. Try and enjoy this process. This will help you with fixing real life problems, because… Guess what?

There are always going to be dirty dishes. 

That pile will be right there again tomorrow, with no sign of your previous efforts. How maddening is that? There will always be laundry and trash. There will always be pain, hunger, financial issues, fights with family and friends, or what have you.

So, do you just give up? It sure is an option. You can *contemplate the meaninglessness of your existence,* and that gives you a pretty good excuse not to do the dishes. But that comes with consequences, doesn’t it? When you don’t work on solving your problems, your problems spread like weeds. Gardens will always have weeds. It’s just your job to deal with them, so you can enjoy your garden.

If you want any chance at having a happy and healthy life, you can’t try and make the dishes go away forever. That’s quite silly. The only sane thing to do is figure out how to enjoy doing the dishes. And that is very different from seeking the accomplishment you get from finishing the dishes.

There is an old story called the Myth of Sisyphus. 

He was a man banished to hell, and his punishment was to roll a giant boulder up a hill. As soon as he got close to the top, the boulder would roll all the way back down to the bottom, no matter how hard he pushed. His only option was to try again, even knowing the eventual fate of his struggle against the boulder.

Unfortunately for the devil, Sisyphus found happiness. He spend eternity trying to solve an unsolvable problem, and loved it. Maybe he went crazy, and maybe being crazy is actually being sane. Maybe we all have to be a little crazy, if we want any chance of enjoying this life.

So, go do the dishes. Then, do the next thing. 

Deal with your financial debt, start the most uncomfortable conversation in the world, or dig into the worst part of whatever your career makes you do. Lean in. Have a laugh at the ridiculousness of your situation.

Maybe next year, you’ll have a million dollars, the partner of your dreams, and complete inner peace. You’ll still have some version of “dishes” to take care of. Just breathe and get to it."

0,"Is your energy trapped by fear? Before i made the conscious decision to break free from the emotional trap i was stuck at, every time i tried to change, i would come up with a story why i can’t or why it’s too hard. I used to back away to story mode as a reason why i’m the way i am and things are the way they are. 

However, the day i hit rock bottom i realized that i used a story to justify not taking action and not doing what i knew needs to be done. The reality is that i was scared, i was scared to make a decision and i was scared to get out of my comfort zone. 

Blaming others and circumstances was usually a story that i used a lot. i used to blame my parents for not having enough money to give me a better education. I used to blame them for not having the education and the profession that would guarantee a higher social status for our family. I used to blame them for not giving me the best experiences as a child; we didn’t travel much, no fancy toys or clothes. 

i felt that by not having all these things, i had to work harder to earn it all. This has put extra pressure on me to study and work hard. I always thought about how my life would have been different had they given me everything i ever wanted when i wanted it. 

I’d never told my parents any of these feelings, and sometimes i was ashamed of myself to think that way. This made me push my feelings away and sometime dismiss them as an embarrassing personal problem. On the long run this approach didn’t help much because my feelings tried to find a new outlet since i refused to acknowledge them. 

The realization that sifted my life was becoming aware of how my emotions were shaping every step of my life. Fear was taking control of my emotional system and hacking the code of my mind to blind my mental and emotional wise vision. 

The truth is that this story is nothing but a distraction form the real problem. My mind was trying to keep me safe by holding me back from going to unvisited territories. My mind didn’t want me to make serious decisions to resolve many things in my life because i was scared. So instead of facing my fear, my mind used this story as a camouflage to hide it. 

Truth is that my parents were never the problem, they did the best they could to give and me and my sisters the best life they could provide us. They held no effort back to make our lives way better than theirs. They were nothing but supportive and loving. If it wasn’t for the challenges they faced in their lives, they would have never been so determined to bring me up better than the way their parents brought them up.

Being aware of the tricks that fear was playing on me made me appreciate their love, effort and sacrifices in ways i never did before. I finally was able to see the view from their seat and it’s light-years different from my version of story. I was too selfish to feel the suffer and pain they endured for our family. 

Now, I couldn’t be prouder of them and everyday i’m grateful to have them by my side. Every time i look at their eyes i can see long work days, little sleep, tired bodies, and worried minds thinking about how to provide and give more. Anytime i feel exhausted in my air-conditioned Lakeview office, i remember how hard it must have been to work in more difficult conditions. This tiny comparison puts things into perspective and brings my selfishness and fear to their knees as i go back to work harder and give more. 

My energy to work, give, love, and live was trapped by my fear of divorcing my story. It was trapped by fear of making a decision, going outside, meeting new people, working hard for my dreams, daring to live the life i want. I was set free the day i decided to face my fear and design a new story that emperors me to be the best i could. 

My parents hardship made them the people they are, but it also made me the person I am, and it will make my children the people they would become. It would have been hard to achieve this level of awareness that pushes us to do more and to be more if it wasn’t for the hard time my parents went though. This is how a couples’ challenge could continue to impact generations when we’re honest to face our fears and not to scared to give it all. 

Truth is we’re all scared and we all have stories about our difficult circumstances, and these stories are valid and worthy of respect. But at the end, it all comes down to what Andy Dufresne said in his brilliant scene in The Shawshank Redemption “Get busy living or get busy dying”. That’s all it is.

0,"5 Good Reasons You Should Start Reading Books Today I’m sure you’ve heard it before “you should read books” and maybe you’re thinking that it’s a bit boring or even a waste of time. I don’t blame you because I was the same way until I accidentally read my first book.

Before you read any further, let me tell you that the only way you can really see how useful books can be is by actually reading a couple of them. It’s one of the things that you appreciate and see the value in them only after doing them.
Okay, now let’s get to the point. How will reading books help you ? Let’s find out.

**1. You gain a lot of experience in a short time**

Most of the time you want to read a book that was written by someone who’s had a meaningful experience because he can teach you stuff that you don’t know.
The biggest advantage when you read a book is that you can pick up many years of experience just by reading a single book in a week so you’re saving yourself a lot of time, effort and potentially money just by learning from others’ experience. This means you can avoid their mistakes and follow their advice since they have already achieved what you want to do.

**2. You can solve problems more easily**

We all have our problems but guess what ? Other people have already figured it out. Reading books can greatly help you to solve your own problems. There’s a book for almost anything now.

You want to get rich ? No problem. You want to develop yourself ? There are plenty of books to help you. You want to learn how to cook ? Plenty to choose from.
In a nutshell, reading a lot of books will help you solve problems becaue you have an already laid out plan that was created by someone who has faced the same problem before.

**3. You learn from real-world experience**

You know how we learn a ton of stuff in school and university but we never really use that in real life ? That’s exactly the opposite with books. The good thing is that you get the real stuff. You can learn lessons from real people who tell you how you can do what you want to do without the unnecessary nonsense that you see in formal education.
In other words, you strictly get the information that you need, not some abstract theories.

**4. You become more knowledgeable**

That’s not a surprise. You read books so you know more stuff, it makes sense. Becoming more knowledgeable can help you become a more interesting person and a better conversationalist since you can talk about a wide variety of topics.

It also helps to know more stuff because you’ll face small challenges every day. Having basic insights about social skills, self-help or even finance can help you deal with whatever life throws at you.

**5. You pick up a new mindset**

While books can provide useful information, they can also teach you an entirely new way of thinking. You can discover some ideas and truths that will make you dramatically shift the way you think.

You know, the ‘aha’ moment. You get to a point where you feel like you figured something out and you were totally wrong before. This means that you can pick up a mindset that will allow you to reach the desired result.
Books don’t just teach you stuff you didn’t know, they also teach you how to think in a certain way.

#You Are Not Your Thoughts

What is mindfulness? In his book, The Mindfulness Solution, Ronald Siegel, an Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical School, gives a pretty good answer.

Via The Mindfulness Solution: Everyday Practices for Everyday Problems:

&gt;The working definition of mindfulness that my colleagues and I find most helpful is awareness of present experience with acceptance. 

You might say: But I’m aware. I’m present. I’m accepting.

And I’d say: No, you’re not.

You’re not aware; you’re staring at your iPhone.

You’re not present; you’re worrying about the future.

You’re not accepting; you’re shaking your fist at traffic because the world doesn’t match the vision in your brain of how it “should” be.

Very often, we’re all stuck in our heads.

We’re not taking the world in; we’re just listening to the stories we tell ourselves about the world, trusting the endless parade of thoughts flitting through our heads instead of actually paying attention to life around us.

One of the fundamental tenets of mindfulness is that we all take our thoughts wayyyyyy too seriously. We think our thoughts always mean something. In fact, we think we are our thoughts and our thoughts are us.

And that’s one of the reasons we worry so much and experience so many negative emotions — because we take our thoughts about the world more seriously than the world itself.

Via The Mindfulness Solution: Everyday Practices for Everyday Problems:

&gt;Mindfulness practice brings all sorts of insights into the workings of the mind. Perhaps the hardest to grasp is the idea that thoughts are not reality. We’re so accustomed to providing a narrative track to our lives and believing in our story that to see things otherwise is a real challenge.

You know as well as I do that all kinds of ridiculous thoughts go through our heads. And sometimes you know not to trust them. When you’re tired, drunk, angry or sick you don’t take your thoughts as seriously.

Mindfulness says you should go a step further. Because you have lots of crazy or silly thoughts all the time. And they can make you anxious or bring you down.

The great psychologist Albert Ellis said we should dispute our irrational thoughts. Great advice — but it can be difficult. You have to be exceedingly rational for it to work.

And sometimes disputing those thoughts can be like a “Chinese finger trap” — the more you resist, the more they ensnare you.

So what can you do?

#Observe. Don’t Judge.

Sometimes you can’t easily dispute those worrying thoughts. So mindfulness simply says: let them go.

Via The Mindfulness Solution: Everyday Practices for Everyday Problems:

&gt;Mindfulness practice helps us avoid the trap of counterproductive thoughts by learning to let them go.

You can’t turn your brain off. And even if you meditate for years you can never fully clear your mind. But you can see those troublesome thoughts, recognize them, but not get tangled in believing them.

Via The Mindfulness Solution: Everyday Practices for Everyday Problems:

&gt;Remember, this practice is not about emptying the mind, getting rid of difficult emotions, escaping life’s problems, being free of pain, or experiencing never-ending bliss. Mindfulness practice is about embracing our experience as it is—and sometimes what is can be unpleasant at the moment… We usually try to feel better by decreasing the intensity of painful experiences; in mindfulness practice, we work instead to increase our capacity to bear them.

And scientific research shows this really works. People feel better and are more engaged with their work after 8 weeks of mindfulness practice.

Via The Mindfulness Solution: Everyday Practices for Everyday Problems:

&gt;Dr. Davidson and Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn recruited a group of pressured workers in a biotechnology firm and taught half of them mindfulness meditation for three hours per week over an eight-week period. They compared this group to a similar group of coworkers who were not taught meditation. On average, all of the workers tipped to the right in their prefrontal cortical activity before taking up meditation. However, after taking the eight-week course, the meditating group now had more left-sided activation than the nonmeditators. The meditators also reported that their moods improved and they felt more engaged in their activities.

I know, I know: Easier said than done, Eric. 

Ignore your thoughts? Let them just float by? Sounds great but how the heck do you do that? Especially when they’re emotionally powerful feelings like worry.

The key is attention. Yeah, that thing none of us seems to have anymore.

But there’s a way to get it back.

#Don’t Distract. Immerse.

I’ve posted before about how important attention is to happiness. And one of the key practices of mindfulness is meditation, which has been shown in scientific studies to improve attention.

While I’m a huge believer in meditation, yes, it can be hard and takes time. Is there another way? Yup.

Next time you’re worrying, remember that your thoughts aren’t real. Life is real.

So turn your attention to your senses. To the world around you. (No, not to your smartphone.)

How does that cup of coffee smell? Did you even notice the people nearby?

Don’t distract yourself. Immerse yourself in the world around you.

&gt;The approach teaches people mindfulness practices with a particular emphasis on not taking any thoughts too seriously but rather staying grounded in sensual reality here and now… Instead of fantasizing about the next moment of entertainment, you can turn your attention to the sights and sounds of standing in line, buying a cup of coffee, and walking down the street. Instead of getting frustrated because the train is late, you can study the other passengers (discreetly), notice the architecture of the station, and attend to the sensations in your body as you sit and wait. There is always something interesting to do—just pay attention to what is occurring right now.

I know what some of you are thinking: The worries keep coming back, Eric. Smelling the coffee didn’t make them go away.

No sweat. We have tools for this.

#Noting And Labeling

Rather than dodging, disputing, or distracting (which can all lead to you just wrestling with those ideas further) acknowledge the thoughts. “Note” them.

You’re not avoiding your thoughts. You acknowledge them… and then turn your attention back to your senses. To your breath. To the feel of the chair beneath your butt. To the person next to you.

For thoughts that keep playing like a broken record, try “labeling” them. Siegel suggests giving the thought a funny name that trivializes it: Oh, that “it’s not going to work out” tape is playing in my head again.

Via The Mindfulness Solution: Everyday Practices for Everyday Problems:

&gt;When the thoughts arise, label them silently before letting them go. You don’t need very many categories. You might choose labels such as “planning,” “doubting,” “judging,” “fantasizing,” obsessing,” or “criticizing.” The particular labels aren’t crucial; what matters is using them to avoid being captured by stories or repetitive tapes. Once you label a thought, gently bring your attention back to the breath. If you find that your attention is repeatedly carried away by particular stories, try making up a humorous label for them. Give these greatest hits their own names, such as your “I blew it again” tape, “I can’t get no respect” tape, “I never get what I want” tape, and so on.

Sound like silly, hippie nonsense? Well, you know those worries that bring you down and make you sad?

A study found mindfulness therapies were just as effective as antidepressants. In fact, many who practiced them regularly were subsequently able to ditch their medication.

Via The Mindfulness Solution: Everyday Practices for Everyday Problems:

&gt;In another, more recent study, MBCT was shown to be as effective as antidepressants in preventing relapses of depression and allowed many subjects to discontinue their medication.

Okay, let’s round this up into a simple system you can use.

#Sum Up

Here’s how to stop worrying and start being mindful:

You are not your thoughts. Sometimes they’re downright ridiculous. Just because you think it, doesn’t make it true.

Observe, don’t judge. Acknowledge the thoughts, but let them float by. Don’t wrestle with them.

Don’t distract, immerse. Do not check your email for the 400th time. Take in the world around you. Turn to your senses. That’s real. Your thoughts and the stories you tell yourself about the world aren’t.

Note or label intrusive thoughts. Yeah, the thoughts fight back. 

Acknowledge them. Give the intrusive ones a funny name.

Return to the senses. Really pay attention to the world around you.

And when I say to pay more attention to the world around you, that doesn’t just mean things. It’s also people.

What ends a lot of relationships? “You don’t pay enough attention to me.”

When we endeavor to let the thoughts in our head go and embrace the world around us, we can focus more attention on the ones we love.

As mindfulness expert Jon Kabat-Zinn points out, in a number of Asian languages “mind” and “heart” are the same word.

So mindfulness isn’t a cold or clinical process. It might as well be translated as “heartfulness.”

0,"You snooze, you loose There were times when i wondered why would i even wake up or get out of bed in the morning. I had nothing to live for. I had no good enough reason to get me to want to move and do something. Nothing in my life seemed compelling or exciting to look forward to. I knew i had to start there, I needed to set a very exciting goal that fuels me and puts the biggest smile on my face. 


In my past life, I used to have this conversation with my mind every singe morning: 


Me: “The alarm is on, I need to wake up” 

My mind: “Just couple more minutes, press the snooze now and we’ll get it next time it’s on!” 

Me: “You’re right, it’s still early anyway”


Ten minutes later, alarm goes on again


Me:”There we go again, time to get it”

My Mind: “wow that was the fastest ten minutes in history!”

Me:”I know that really didn’t feel like a lot of time”

My mind: “see you can’t even get something done in ten minutes, so why not use the time and get some rest!” 

Me: “Yes but I’ve been sleeping for like 8 hours now”

My mind: “well yes that’s because people’s needs for sleep vary from one to another. It looks like your body have special demands!”

Me: “I guess you’re right, I wish i could be my sister, she gets by with only 5 hours of sleep. I have no idea how the heck she does that. I envy her, i really do” 

My mind: “see told you! you probably use your brain too much during the day so you need extra sleep to give your neurons some time to process these information” 

Me: “OMG you’re probably right. Alright, maybe today I’l get enough sleep and then tomorrow I can get more done. Besides, it’s really early, who wakes ups at 7 am? only birds, but they have a mission, I DON’T!!!” 


The amount of effort i had to endure everyday to convince myself to get out of bed was painful. I truly thought it was a global phenomenon, until i found out that there were actually people who wake up right away. It literally blew my mind and i thought what makes them get up that quick and without hesitation. 


It turns out i have been training my brain for all these years to keep repeating the same pattern. The hesitation and the dwelling that I put my mind and body through isn’t peculiar to waking up in the morning. I carried it away with me to almost all areas of my life and it really got me in this anxious mode of thinking and feeling. I knew I had some many decisions to make every single day, little decisions, but they take a lot of my energy. 


Anxiety was fed by my hesitation and fear of making decisions. I had to think a lot before i could make up my mind. My hesitation trapped my energy and aliveness. It robbed me of my respect to myself because i never felt capable enough to decide. 


So whenever you take too long to make a decision, know that fear is holding you back. The longer it takes you to decide, the more you anxious you become. You feed your anxiety by hesitation and you nurture it to grow and suck life out of you. Decide once and for all to never allow to live one more day and just decide. 

Having exciting goals is the reason i wake up everyday now. My mind does’t drag me to these time wasting conversations because it’s excited to get up. I don’t have to think about whether or not i should get up, i just get up. I know that if i don’t wake up, my goal will take longer to become real. This is the power that kicks me up and keeps me going. 

Next time your alarm goes on, shake off your anxiety and wake up. If you don’t you’ve just given it another day to live. Snooze will get you to loose another opportunity to make your dream a reality. "

0,"Falling into the trap of unconscious conformity 
One of the very first things i did to transform my life was to reconsider the beliefs that lead my life. Going to this long unvisited territory was mind-blowing to say the least. I found out i had beliefs that i unconsciously formed years ago and never even questioned ever since. 

These beliefs kept me stuck in the mind of a 12 year old who’s been making my life decision and choices ever since. How come I never paid attention to the amount of damage that these beliefs have caused in my life? why did i allow these lies to shape how i think, feel, and act? why have i accepted these ideas as the ultimate truth and never even questioned their validity? 

I think one key reason was what I call “unconscious conformity”. Throughout my life one of the driving forces has been to be like everybody else, to think what they think, to do what they do. I might have done it unconsciously most of the time because I thought why would anybody want to be different.

A key reason most of us do that is because we want others to love and accept us. So we assume that we should be like everybody else because this is the main way to get love and acceptance. We use other people’s thoughts, beliefs, and experiences as reference points for us to think, belief, and act the same way.

 The problem with doing this is that we start living other people's lives rather than our own. We become versions of others echoing their thoughts, and actions. We might pretend to own these thoughts and actions as ours. But the only thing we can’t pretend is how we feel deep inside about it . 

I’ll never forget the day when i was preparing the thesis for my masters degree and my supervisor’s comment on my work  was “I don’t see you in this work, I only see regurgitation of other scholars works and thoughts, where are you? what do you think?”. I was too embarrassed to tell him that I don’t know who I am or what to think. I’ve been others long enough that i didn’t even know how to be me. 

Using and learning from other people’s thoughts, experiences, and teachings is great and it could save us a lot of time and effort because we don’t have to reinvent the wheel. But using others as THE ONLY reference to build our identities and our lives is like building a sand castle. It could be knocked off in seconds because it’s not built on the strong foundations of OUR beliefs, values, and identities. 

The biggest favor you could do to yourself, your loved ones, and the whole world is to be the best version of your true self. This is where you can find genuine love and peace that lasts a lifetime and leaves a legacy that lives long after you’re gone.

0,"Here's why it took me so long to turn my life around From the last posts on my journey out of depression and anxiety, I realized that a lot of people are struggling with the same challenges i went through back then. One thing caught my attention about some of the comments and messages I received. I realized that most of us often know that something is wrong, something needs to be done, but the majority get stuck in deciding that they’re going to do something about it. So i thought of writing this post about the 3 things that held me back from doing something to figure myself and my life out. This could be helpful to people who are stuck in a situation between wanting to change and being scared of doing something to change.

1) Silence is a killer

One thing i now know for sure is that had i spoken up earlier about some of the difficulties i was going through, somebody would have offered me the right help. But there are two beliefs that stopped from doing that. First, i thought that what i’m experiencing is very peculiar to me and nobody else is going through the same thing. The other thing is i believed that nobody could help me because they don’t know how i feel and there’s nothing they could do about it.

2) pain wasn’t painful enough

The roots of my anxiety and depression started to grow when i was in high school. I’ve always felt something was wrong about how i feel towards events, people , and myself. At first those feelings were subtle and going on in the background. Then they started to grow stronger and take the front screen of my mind. However, all this time the intensity of my emotions was not one that seriously threatened the quality if my life. That’s why i never thought of something about it. The pain still wasn’t painful enough for me to get up and decide to work out.

I had all the time starting from high school to fix my issues before they’re too big to handle, but i never did. I let my emotional issues grow older and stronger as time passed by. But as soon as I experienced a level of pain that’s life threatening, my decision was instant. I realized that if i didn’t change it, my life could be the price to pay (literally and figuratively).

At that moment, issues of years were wiped in months because i had high level of serious commitment to show up to myself, do the work, and make the change i want in my life. I knew if i waited a bit more , my loss would be bigger that it could ruin my life.

3) This belief held me back the most

The biggest barrier that held me back from doing something to change was a belief i used to have that “I can’t really have what i want in life”. Even though i didn’t verbalize that belief out loud to myself, but i really lived by it. i thought about it, heard others talk about it, and i truly bought into the idea that i had to be born a certain way to get what i wanted. So the result was that i never tried in the first place.

I have no regret what so ever for the time that took me to get to where i am today, but i truly believe that this journey could be cut very short when you become aware of the three points above. Being smart is learning from other people’s mistakes so that you don’t have to make them yourself. It saves you ton of time, effort, and money when you’r willing to listen and act on it.

So my advice to anybody who’s facing similar challenges in life is to listen and act to save yourself.

Feel free to ask any questions, hope this helps."

0,"2 Discoveries that changed my life I have looked into the lives of people from all classes of the world.

Observing the rich from a distance and tapping into the wisdom of the poor in person.

And what I have discovered is something that continues to blow my mind on a daily basis.

Actually, I discovered two things.

First, I realised  that no man is never happy unless he is dominating a specific area which he is passionate about.

Man is happy when he is dominating and excelling in any area of passion.

But man can only succeed if he puts in the work and time in a specific area.

This leads me to my second discovery.

Wallace Wattles once wrote that ""THE CAUSE OF SUCCESS IS THE MAN WHO SUCCEEDS"".

I have realised from this statement that the true cause of success is the personality of the individual.

Who you become on your journey to success is more important than success itself.

Your enviroment and challenges are not the reason why you are not successful or living the life you desire.

  All these things are nothing as compared to the power that lies within a man who has conditioned himself for success in character and attitude.

And just like Wallace Wattles once wrote ""POVERTY IS NO BARRIER TO GREATNESS, FOR POVERTY CAN ALWAYS BE REMOVED"". I also want to tell you that your enviroment and challenges are no barrier to greatness, for they can always be removed.

You can do great things despite what you facing right now.

0,"My relationships didn’t save me, only I did! 
Lately I’ve been contemplating how transforming out of depression has allowed me to get a different perspective on some of the things i used to do in my past life. Depression and anxiety kept me too blind to see a lot of things that i clearly get now. Being stuck in the dark caves of my own emotions held me hostage to all sorts of limiting thoughts and behaviors. 

After finding my true self, i realized that i approached the majority of my relationships from one of three emotional needs. I mention them here to give anybody who’s stuck in anxiety, depression, or similar unhealthy patterns of thoughts and feelings an opportunity to look at yourself through a third person lens. This might give you more awareness of the way our emotions shape our behaviors and relationships. 

I’ve always wondered about the formula of having successful and fulfilling relationships. I think about what makes some relationships amazingly fluffing and playful while others empty and pointless. I knew that when i figure this out, it could be a gate to one of the most precious happinesses in life. I wanted to make my relationships loving, joyful, and playful. 

looking back now i can see why my relationships were not where i wanted them to be. There are many things that go into having a fulfilling relation with a partner, a family member, or a friend. But one key was how i approached my relations. i found that most of the time i entered a relation for one of 3 reasons, to get saved, motivated, or distracted. Bare in mind that most of these reasons were going on in the back of my mind and unconsciously driving my relationship decisions. 

1. To be saved 
I’ve always felt that my life wasn’t where i wanted it to be, but i didn’t know what was the reason or how to put things in the right place. I got stuck in the not-knowing area for a long time during which my attitude towards a relation would be to a hope to get saved by somebody else. so i always had this idea that maybe when somebody else finds out about the difficulties i’m going through, maybe they’ll save me and help figure things out. 

2. To be motivated 
Because most of the time my mode was fluctuating between anger and sadness, I thought that  it could be good to have someone to motivate me to do stuff and keep me going. So i expected my relationships to be kinda of ongoing motivational videos, i needed them to get the pump and the rush to get things done. You know, we might disappoint ourselves but it’s much harder to disappoint our loved ones. 

3. To be distracted 
And there also were times when relations were there to distract me from being alone and having to deal with my issues. Somebody else needs me to talk, to go out, to solve a problem. So i felt needed and distracted. i no longer had to worry about how i felt or what i should do about it.The most important thing is that i wasn’t alone to deal with it and i was busy doing something, anything!

Relations are an essential source of love and happiness when they are built for the right reasons. The minute we use them as an excuse to run away or a reason to get something, they’ll become a source of pain or a barrier towards gain. 

The minute i realized that i reshaped my relations and reconsidered the way i approached them. From that day on i don’t feel the need to be saved, motivated, or distracted. 

My advice to anyone who’s having issues with a relationship is to think of why do you have the relations you have and what makes you maintain them. If your reason is to hide, I highly recommend you consider facing whatever you’re running away from. It’s not as scary as it sounds.

I am a product designer student/entrepreneur  that needs some help with a project: I need to find a innovative or creative  subject/idea/concept that has something to do with the concept 'smart city' and that connects to the city in someway and has to improve the life of the citizens in that city.
Improving the life quality in atleast 1 of those hatches: Smart mobility, Economy, Security, Education, Living, Environment.
The product has to be a digital product so a website, platform, application,...

I came up with some ideas/concepts this weeks but right now I'm still kinda unsatisfied about the ideas/concepts..
The ideas:

- Smart Tour Guide (Tourism)

- Carpooling Platform

- Breakdown assistance: that means when your car breaks down, towing services will view your location by your smartphone's location and send a professional to help you immediately and reduce traffic jam.
- Digital customer card with discounts \ offers
- App that gives real-time info about shops, city,..
- Local platform neighborhood so that you know what's happening in your neighbourhood only, to reduce facebook groups, get notifications (f.e events, bad traffic/road,..), lend stuff,  message, get to know ppl,... 


So those where the ones that stick out the most during the brainstorm sessions If you have any good, refreshing idea/concept please let me know.

Thank You for reading and I highly appreciate some feedback to help me out!"

Since then I’m still committed to the decision I made back then to reinvent every area of my life, and live a fulfilling life. The level of pain i hit that time of my life shock my existence to the core and brought me face to face with the hardest truth of my life. I realized I’ve been living a life that didn’t reflect who i truly was, or what i wanted to create out of it. I’ve been living according to expectations of others and society. I decided that i no longer accept to be, think, feel, or behave as expected. This was the day I allowed myself to live a life true to myself no matter what. 

Working hard and being successful only to meet the expectations drained me emotionally. I used to believe that as a girl I had to hide my feelings because showing them would mean I was too weak to be perceived as successful. So I often acted as a strong person even at the times i most needed help. To me success, respect, and a good quality of life meant i had to be a certain way and keep my emotions to the side. In a modern society where there’s more pressure to be, do, and have, sometimes our feminine side gets buried under pressure and work. Our emotions suffer because we forget a valuable and an essential side of who we are and what we need. 

Living up to expectations is like wearing a mask and hiding our true identity to show somebody else that we are who they think we are. The conflict between our true identity and the fake one creates unbearable amounts of emotional pain. At a certain point our energy is drained and the mask starts to wear out. At that time we’re either lucky to use the pain as a wakeup call or we let the moment pass us by and gets the best of our lives leaving us with the bitterness of regret. 

years ago i was on the floor of my then one-bedroom apartment all alone and crying at the lowest point of my life. Back then I knew that if i let this moment pass me by without using it to turn my whole life around, I would live the rest of my life in regret (if I live at all!). That moment defined my life and it put everything into perspective. All of a sudden, things, people, and life had a different meaning and taste. I was no longer able to live out of fear to let somebody down, instead my values, beliefs, and vision became my compass to never get lost again. 

My advice to anyone who’s stuck in expectations, is to free yourself out. You’re far more fulfilled and useful to others when you live life according to your standards and choices. Disappointing some people might be a by product at first, but the ones that truly love and care about you will get it. Only then you have the power to be, and give more to yourself and to others. It’s fascinating how much we’re willing to do for others and not as much for ourselves. But know that if anybody deserves to be given anything, it would be you deserving freedom to live the kind of life you decide. 

Wish you freedom and fulfillment.

0,"For Two Months, I Got My News From Print Newspapers. Here's What I Learned. "
0,"This is how my unhealthy emotions sucked life out of my relationships! Hi guys, 

I read a number of posts and comments about depression and relationships. So I’m writing this post to tell you my experience of how anxiety and depression made my relations suck until I figured things out. 

I’ve always felt like I’m missing so much in my relationships because I often felt prisoned my own emotions and thoughts. I was confused most of the time because I was treating others in a way that I dreaded, and felt guilty about. I felt like i was being someone else I wasn’t; angry or sad most of the time venting my emotions on the dearest people to me. 

After I transformed myself out of depression i realized that it was my depression and anxiety that was driving me to behave that way. I thought and acted out of the depressed and anxious state that i was locked in. I was blind to the value of my relationships and how much happiness and fulfillment they could bring to my life if I know how to approach them out of love and joy, instead of anger and sadness. These are 3 of the most essential realizations we need to learn about to be able to build happy and fulfilling relationships that last a lifetime. 

1) It’s not just about me 
At the time of my depression i was constantly thinking and focusing on myself. What do i want? How do i feel? why am I having these weird thoughts at the middle of my talk with my best friend? am I gonna be depressed my entire life? I wonder if they notice that i’m not myself? 

 This is not to suggest that I didn’t care about others because my sense of guilt and blame meant i did. But I was thinking about myself way more and focusing on my problems, my issues, and my emotions. Always worrying about what I want, what i’m not getting, and how miserable my life was. 

However, i found that it’s key in relations to also think about the needs of other people who are sharing these relationships with you. Thinking about how to help others get their emotional needs helps you cultivate the art of giving which is the essence of life. The minute you learn how to get out of your own head and give others your genuine undivided attention, the minute you’ll connect with them in the most truly powerful way you’ve ever had. 

2) Communication is key
There were many times I felt stuck in loneliness while having many family members and friends around. Why didn’t i reach out to anyone of them? why did i constantly held myself back from telling them what i was going through? why did it feel like pushing a very heavy rock up a mountain to talk about my depression? 

i was fighting myself, my emotions, and it brought a lot of anger and eventually resentment to my life. This made my relationships with my family or then fiancee seem very empty and at times even pointless. My phases of sadness and anger left me unable to genuinely connect with the people that mattered the most in my life. There was always this absence of true expression of feelings that kept me stuck in a shell of my own dark emotions that were eating me alive. 

Part of it was because i didn’t know how to verbalize my feelings, so I didn’t know what to say or how to approach my mom, one of my sisters, or then fiancee. They might think I’m exaggerating when i say “I’m depressed, I don’t know what to do, and I think I need help ”. 

Another thing was that I didn’t even know what exactly caused my depression and anxiety. Most of the time when i intellectualize facts of my life, I don’t find dramatic events that might’ve caused my depression to be that severe. This would often stop me from talking because people might think i’m making it up to get some attention. 

what i found is that so many times our emotions get in the way of our communication. We hold ourselves back form doing something only because we’re acting out of our emotional focus of the moment. When we’re depressed, we approach our relationships with sadness, anger, hopelessness, or indifference. But this isn’t who we truly are, it’s just our emotions speaking in our behalf. 

3) They expected something from me, I expected something back, and we got lost in the way (bummer) 

Back then my sense of identity wasn’t clear yet and so i was challenged most of the time on who i was, what i want, and what to do. I was stuck in the frame that the society and others has put me in. I was acting according to that frame, and i was feeling and behaving according to the expectations that came along with it. My unconscious feelings of confusion about who i was and what i should do with m life left me resistant and defensive most of the time. 

The high expectations I had from my relationships with people often left me disappointed and hurt. I had a certain idea of what action, word, behavior, feedback, or emotion I want to get from somebody, and when that doesn’t happen, I find myself falling back into deep loneliness. Getting the expectation became a sign of being understood and the absence of it meant the absence of understanding. 

I was operating from a belief that “people don’t understand me and they can’t get me”. So I didn’t even try to genuinely communicated with them. The truth that shifted everything (literally) to me was believing that “Nobody owes me anything in life, nothing!” and acting out of this. The day i started putting that belief into action was the day i stopped having any expectations from others. 

This is not out of indifference about others or not giving a shit about them. I just don’t look at my relations as a trade anymore; I don’t dwell upon what am i gonna get out of it, or what this person has to do to prove me anything. Giving others and serving people brings far more joy, love, and satisfaction than getting from them. This is key in building healthy fulfilling relations that enrich our lives instead of making us miserable. The best thing i did was becoming more to give more, and that makes me more fulfilled than I’ve ever been in my life. 

Now that my life is in a far better place, i can clearly see how my my depression and other limiting emotions were keeping me blind and so tunnel visioned on what i thought to be my reality. Now I know I have the power to change anything in my life, I know I have the power to live the reality I choose. 

Learning how our emotions shape our realities and relations is a step forward towards opening ourselves to understanding and communicating with ourselves and the people we value the most in our lives. 

Hope this helps anybody who’s challenged by depression and trying to build meaningful relationships.

0,"“Who am I?” was the first question in my journey to finding myself A few days back i wrote a post on [“Who are you?” is it ok if I don’t know (yet)!] about how finding my identity helped with my anxiety and depression, and I got some messages asking about the process and some other details. I thought I’d write this post as a follow up on the four things I wish I knew back when i was starting the process of transforming myself out of anxiety and depression. Of course, you don’t have to be depressed or anxious to want to figure yourself out. I found this to be a fantastic starting point to designing and living a more fulfilling life.

Years ago I took the first step to change my life and put an end to the anxiety and depression that I’ve lived out of for a long time. I spent a lot of time stuck in where to start from. I, then, realized that I’ve always had difficulty answering essential questions like “who am I” and what do i want in life, so i decided this could be a good place to start. These are the 4 things I wish I knew back then when I was at the beginning of the quest. 

1. why does it even matter to answer that question in the first place? 
Sometimes I thought of this question as a philosophical approach towards life and maybe it wasn’t that essential to know who i am to be happy and have a good life. Until one day we were having a leadership training for graduate students and one of our colleagues came late to the session. The professor who was a leadership expert politely embarrassed the guy telling him that true leaders who are committed enough act like ones. It was a big aha moment for me to finally see the power of identity. We behave according to our identities and that’s why its essential for us to answer that question to start acting according to who we truly are. 

2. There are many ways to define ourselves 
One of the most common ways to define ourselves is according to our professions, our income, our possessions, our religious beliefs, our accomplishments, or even our looks. But later on I noticed that this is only the verbalized way though which we describe ourselves. However, there are more powerful but less used (or to be more accurate less outspoken) way to define ourselves such as our emotions (lover, joyful, sincere, or caring), our behavior (a lier, a gambler, a a crock, or a smoker), our self image (worthless, unique, special), or our past results  (successful, or a failure). I know that i’ve always defined myself according to my profession, and the frame I was expected to be in. Even when i referred to the past i was very selective in only choosing to focus on the times i didn’t get the results i wanted and defined myself as a failure. 

3. Our identities evolve! (I didn’t know that …) 
I’ve always thought of identity as a fixed description that we sort of get stuck in and it stays with us for life. This may sound no brainer to me now that i’m aware of all these aspects of my life, but back then when I defined myself as a failure (even just thinking about it), I didn’t see it as something i could change or get rid of. I thought of it like a stamp that I got for a life time (even if i didn’t ask for). Back then I saw myself as a pathetic, depressed, anxious, angry, and sad person who’s bound to be that way for life. As such I acted out of who i was, so i was either depressed, anxious, sad, or angry at any given time (see i was committed to my identity). 

4. We have the power to reinvent who we are 
Since our identities evolve, then we have the power to change them any time we decide to. Quitting your job and starting a business is a change in identity. Finding out your values and starting to act out of integrity instead of following the spammy trends of the market is another change in identity. So being aware that we have the power to change any disempowering side of our identities is a crucial step in getting ourselves  to behave out of our new ones.  

So my advice to anyone who’s about to start this journey soon is to first consider these four points before you start doing the work. The second is to be in a good mental and emotional state, to be curious about learning, and finding out more. When you try to do this out of fear, your answers might not reflect who you think you are at that time. 

Hope this is of value to anybody who’s in search for meaning and an exit out of confusion. 
Feel free to ask or comment.

0,"The 1 thing that shifted my game of life Hi guys, 

I see many posts from people battling anxiety and depression and going around in closed circles of mental and emotional pain. As a person who was severely depressed at a certain point of my life, I thought I’d write a post about the one thing that made a huge difference in the journey of healing my anxiety and depression. I also think this could be of great help to anybody who's been stuck in limiting emotions. 

I was trying to find out where depression stems from before it starts to take over my body, mind, and heart. At the beginning of my depression I used to have a lot of swinging modes from sadness, to happiness (which wasn’t pure happiness either!). Sometimes the speed with which these modes change drove me insane (literally). I would be having an amazing time with a friend, a family member, or even by myself, then the next thing i know is that i’m feeling depressed. 

Because I’m an intellectually open person, i was willing to consider all sorts of possibilities and explanations for these swinging modes. I started experimenting with some ways to monitor my mind and my emotions to arrive at the reason for these modes. I so much wanted to find out where depression comes from. 

Then one day I was having a good time with a friend when she started telling me about how worried she was for the future of her children if her husband didn’t get the position in that big corporation. It suddenly grabbed my attention that it all starts from thoughts. I started to recall the times when i experienced these swinging modes, and I noticed that the one thing that shifted my mode was a thought. When a certain thought took the center stage of my mind, the result is either happiness or depression. 

Mostly these thoughts were either about the past or the future. When I think about something not very pleasant that happened tome in the past, I automatically feel depressed because I feel like I have no power to change it. When I become worried about how something would turn out to be in the future I again get into the depression mode. 

 
At first I dismissed this explanation, but when I put it to practice, it proved to be very effective in stimulating or shifting my depression emotions. The speed with which these thoughts were taking over my mind was absolutely fascinating and scary at the same time. I could be be doing ok one minute and the next I want to crawl back in my bed, and it’s all because of a thought! 

At first I tried to track my thoughts, and of course it didn’t work out because I’m having a gazillion thought every minute. So I decided to go the other way around and start with the end in mind. My emotions became the compass that directed my thoughts, not the other way around. I decided what I want to feel, and started having thoughts that generated this feeling for me. 

Emotions and thoughts are two major powers that shaped my experience with depression and anxiety. Taking inventory of my life started by leading my emotions and thoughts instead of having them lead me. 

Hope you find this of value. Feel free to ask any questions, happy to help anytime.

0,"“Who are you?” is it ok if I don’t know (yet)! Hi guys, 

I’ve come across many posts and comments from people who are going through different types of emotional challenges. I noticed that a common theme between many of these posts and comments is a sense of loss, and confusion about one’s self. It seems that the loss of clarity about who we are is a pain point that’s causing our emotions to put us through a constant battle that drains our energy. So, I thought I’d point out how finding my true identity helped me in healing anxiety and depression. 

Long ago my sister fell off the stairs and hit her head pretty bad that she suffered from temporary memory loss. She couldn’t  remember who we are, who she was, or any other details about her life at all. She was scared and even though physically her life wasn’t in danger, but the psychological effect of the accident was getting the best of her. 

It was both scary and fascinating to watch her navigate her way through all the overwhelm and confusion of her emotions. She had us, her family and friends, but yet fear and confusion was all i could see in her eyes and face. 

Years ago when my anxiety and depression was the worst it got in my life, I remembered that accident. I felt the same fear and confusion that I had seen in my sister’s eyes. Even though I hadn’t lost my memory, but it felt like my loss wasn’t any less painful. I had absolutely no clue who I was, I had no sense of direction, and I felt that everything that could possibly connect me to this life was outside my reach. It was all circumstances, things, conditions, or labels that dictated how I think, how I feel, and what I did. 

Suddenly I could see myself in my sister’s body and feel the pain of losing her identity. I finally realized that almost all the things that made me who I was didn’t come from deep within. My body, my sex, my job, my relationships, my political tendencies, my hobbies, and the material things I own are NOT who I truly am. I finally grasped the reality that none of this matters if it’s not a reflection of my true identity and if it doesn’t flow from within.  

The things my sister needed back then were love, security, and compassion. That was the language she understood when no words seemed to comfort her pain. These were the emotions that shaped her experience and brought her back to life. All she was vanished in a minute and was quickly restored once we knew what she needed the most, love.

On the day I was shocked to contemplate ending my life, I realized the one thing that could bring me back to the safe shore of myself was to find my true identity. I knew life would be meaningless unless I Know who I am and what I want out of it. Anxiety and depression were a signal that I was mentally and emotionally lost, and I had to find myself to put them to sleep once and for all.  

Beliefs, thoughts, values, and emotions were the vehicle I used to arrive at the safe destination of my true self. 

If you’re stuck where I used to be, I recommend you start there. 

Hope this could be of value to you in your journey. Feel free to ask any questions, I’m always happy to help.

0,"3 key things that finally turned it around for me Hi guys,
 
Been seeing a lot of posts from people challenging anxiety, depression, and the rest of the package that comes with it (self doubt, low self esteem, negative self talk, etc…). I thought I’d just point out the top 3 key things that turned my anxiety and depression (as well as some other emotional negative package!).
 
A quick background, I have been suffering from anxiety and depression for as far as I remember. Over the years it took so many forms and translated into different physical and emotional symptoms (stomach aches, negative relation with food, and general exhaustion). I had emotional swinging modes of sadness, anger, and hopelessness. During my study years, I had difficulty focusing and usually got interrupted by daydreaming (was told to have ADHD and dyslexia!).
 
Few years ago, I was in a work trip abroad and my depression had reached the top it ever got in my life. I started contemplating ending my life, and even though I didn’t attempt or consider actually doing it. I was shocked because i never thought the idea could even cross my mind, and so this was the alarm that got me dead serious about figuring my shit out.
 
So I thought I would give you a quick summary of the top 3 things that were key in turning everything in my life around (that includes my body, my relations, and my work). i just want to say that there is never one thing that has the absolute answer, but the combination of these steps made the huge difference I’ve always been looking for (of course there’s more into it than these 3 steps, but these were the best start)
 
1)         Where does it all start
 
During my depression and anxiety time I found it very difficult to make decisions. I spend a long time trying to get a lot of information, thinking, and over analyzing things. Even the smallest types of decisions (like ordering a food at a restaurant, or a piece of clothes) would take me long to  finally decide. I used to ponder a lot and think about whether this decision is the right one or is it yet another mistake. I’d also worry about what others think of my decisions, and so I’d ask most of the people around me about what they think. I was also worried about failing because what would that would make me.
 
There’s nothing wrong with asking for opinions, and getting some background information. However, excessively doing that drained me of two essential things; energy and self confidence. i realized that I weigh people’s opinions against mine and gradually that left me dependent on others. Suddenly, I realized that most of the things I’ve done in my life were directly or indirectly the result of social and environmental pressures. My clothes, my education, my profession, and the nature of my relations are nothing but clear representations that my decisions were not entirely mine.
 
So I started reading and studying more about how we make decisions, and what are some of the decisions that I could make to completely change my life. I suddenly realized that everyday I make millions of tiny decisions that could completely change my life if I become more conscious about how I make them. The decision to eat healthy rather than junk, the decision to exercise instead of watching TV, the decision to work on a side project rather than surfing the internet, the decision to wake up early rather than hitting the snooze button. All these might be small decisions but they shape my life and they make me the person I am. My life is shaped by the decisions I make everyday. So, I chose to save my emotional, mental, and physical energy by deciding once and for all to win the game and build the kind of life I want to live. Most people spend their entire lives without making that decision, and they continue to exist in the no-man-land (swinging and hanging in between).
 
2)         Some people live and die without figuring this out
 
It’s funny how sometimes the most important moments in our lives are so little that it could be so easy to miss when we’re not paying attention. We were having a sports leader training for a volunteer event when one of the coaches asked us to do an exercise in pairs. The name of the exercise was “who are you?!”. I was back to back with one of my mates when we started asking each other the “who are you question?” each time we were supposed to give a new answer.
 
Most of the people in the room answered the question referring to things like their jobs, relationships, sexes, religions, hobbies, sports activities, nationalities, political ideologies, or even pets. It suddenly hit me that all these things were actually circumstances, and none of them reflected who we truly were. I thought what if I lose my memory tomorrow? would that mean I’m no longer who I am, then who do I become?
 
This is one of the reasons that drag people into pain when they lose any of these circumstances. I realized that our identities is hugely attached to what we have, and what we do, but not as much to who we truly are. I came to know that who I am has nothing to do with my job, my relations, or my appearance, but it has everything to do with my beliefs, values, and emotions.
 
At the end of the day we all want what we want because we want to feel something out of it. Customer psychology revealed that people don’t buy products, but they buy identities. We buy a certain brand show to feel a certain way. This is not only peculiar to buying, but to most of the decisions we make in our lives. We get married (normally), have kids, have friends to feel loved, cared for, and appreciated. The basis that we use to make our decisions are beliefs, values, and emotions.
 
3)         Always looking, don’t know for what! 
 
It used to annoy me when I walk into a store and a salesperson ask me, so “what are you looking for today?”. It’s a simple example, but it’s a critical one and it used to happen to me a lot. Most of the time I had no idea what I was looking for and what I really wanted in life. When i was at school, and somebody ask me this silly question of “what do you want to be when you grow up?” and because i was too embarrassed to say “I don’t know!”, I’d say something like like the rest of my mates “I wanna be a doctor “, truth is I didn’t!
 
Most of my life I didn’t know what I wanted to be, have, do, feel, be with. I just didn’t know! So when i made the decision to change my lief, I figured that the first thing i needed to find out was what I wanted to be, have, do, and feel in all areas of my life.
 
So one day I sat down and I wrote everything I wanted in life. starting from my body, my relations, my work, my mission in life, my emotions, finance, travel and fun. I asked myself “who do I want to be? What do I want to do, and have?” I decided to design my life the way people design their homes. I consciously pick emotions, thoughts, experiences, people, and things I want to have. 
 
It’s a true pleasure for me to wake up in the morning knowing that I have the power over how I want to feel, think, and do in my life no matter what happens.
 
These strategies didn’t develop overnight and they don’t come in default mode, but now because this is how I live day to day, they become my second nature. I don’t fight over to do the work because this is who I am NOW. I just flow out of my nature.
 
Hope this helps anybody who wants to make a true change and own their lives. Happy to help out with any questions.

1,"If you feeling that you stuck in your practice, try traditional Stoicism, where Logos is vital part When I was modern stoic, who just started diving into stoicism, I was shocked by amount of divinity in texts and blocked my mind from understanding. Because I was thinking that Logos it’s a some kind of monotheistic god. 
But after stoicism on fire podcast I learned that I was wrong and disabled all mental gymnastic created to ignore Logos in stoicism. 
Logos demands nothing, except your virtue, without any prayers. And without it, I think practice will be hard"

10 months left in my lease and people moved in upstairs who are LOUD. Every way to make noise, they are experts. Stomping, dragging furniture constantly, barking dogs, trashy late-night shouting matches, random hammering, the whole enchilada.

After my lease is up I can move, but until then I'm in a situation I cannot control and I find myself losing my temper. I'll have an outburst and pound on the ceiling. Of course they completely ignore my ""hints"". I feel like a prisoner in my own house. How do I overcome my emotions and accept my situation for the next 10 months?"

There's a part about breaking someone's heart with a hasty word. I've never been called out by a song before, but this song had me by the throat. Having a tendency to make quick decisions and regretting hurting people because of it.

I've read William B. Irvine's *A Guide to the Good Life*. I made cliff notes for myself and have been focusing on practicing a single idea from the book each week. This seems to be really effective for me so far. I plan on doing this with other books as I find new practices or ideas in them.

I read *Meditations* a few years ago and still have a copy. I also have *Discourses* and *Letters from a Stoic*.

What references have worked best for you? Any pitfalls to avoid that you would share with a beginner? Any feedback is appreciated."

1,"Can you be Stoic and a nihilist at the same time? Hello.

When it comes to morality and the value of life, to me it only comes down to how much you value it. A kind of subjectivism. 

Proponents of the is/ought say you can't derive morality from how something is. Morals have changed through history and were not set in stone, so how can you argue for moral objectivty? Or argument from nature, in psychopaths nature there is a lack of empathy, but it's his nature. 

Nature it self seems cruel, look at things as parasitic wasps, what did the caterpillar do to them to deserve that? 

Or things from my own case, the genetic flaws, I was born with them. The only thing that could have been done here is for my parents to see they have flawed genetics and not to reproduce. 

But then again bashing your head about this does not yeild any results. That is where Stoicism comes in.

Accept the fact and try to improve what you can. That is the greatest merit of Stoicisim to me. 

What I don't agree with is holding out for things like virtues, to benefit the society. I did not give consent to be born in the first place. 

For example, I want to die by suicide. It's not something that I had in a emotional break down, I was born broken. I may not have terminal diagnosis, but all of my conditions require me to focus 100% on my health and build everything around it. 

Nietzsche said, if one can't get to ones goal of life because of health, suicide is a way to go. 

Stoics were also for it, as a user pointed in my last post here. You just said that, if I am unsure that is a sign I am not ready for it and that I have duties to others, the latter, no I don't. Only in the case of kids I made and that is not the case, it's one of the reasons why I was, am and will be childfree. The former, can be debated."

You can, however, suggest. If they don’t care, they don’t care. And neither should you.

The book is a passionate and beatifully written set of accounts of gay men struggling to come to terms with their emotional wounds. Written and narrated by Alan Downs, a clinical (gay) psychologist who believes in the power of dialectic behavioural therapy (DBT), a branch of psychology similarly to CBT and hence Stoic in essence.

 I wanted to share this hidden gem with anyone interested in tsiloring their own Stoic practice for self acceptance and/or understanding of the lgbtq+ community.

Quotes from book:

&gt; The damaging part of learning to live your life in two parts , whether in reality or fantasy, cannot be underestimated. It is an infectious skill that you learned, one that would eventually spread beyond the bedroom of your life. Life wasn't ever what it seemed on the surface. Nothing could be trusted for what it appeared to be. After all, you weren't what you appeared to be. In learning to hide part of yourself, you lost the ability to trust anything or anyone fully. Without knowing it, you traded humane innocence for dry cynicism.

&gt; Contentment is created when your behaviour is consistent with your values. When you act in ways that are consistent with the core of who you are, even when your actions aren't approved by others, you increase your overall contentment. Happiness, success, money, relationships, and even the approval of others will come and go in your life, but what is ultimately satisfying is feeling content."
1,"On Permanence and Reason &gt;He who has vehement desire for posthumous fame does not consider that every one of those who remember him will himself also die very soon; then again also they who have succeeded them, until the whole remembrance shall have been extinguished as it is transmitted through men who foolishly admire and perish. 

\- Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, Book IV - 19

Aurelius likes to go back to this theme of endless time and oblivion. Memento Mori, or remember that you will die is a common saying. Nothing is permanent. Your problems, life, legacy, not even the universe is permanent.

I started thinking about this a lot when I started to do things for the permanence of it, like journaling, writing letters, or getting a tattoo. And I guess in this age, anything you do or say on the internet is permanent now. We seem to be obsessed with leaving a mark, recording our lives, leaving a legacy in this world when our time is up. People always want to leave the world a better place than how they found it; they want to be remembered. But why? Like Marcus Aurelius said, Memento Mori. Nothing is permanent.

&amp;#x200B;

Permanence

It’s a funny word actually, is anything really permanent? We tend to refer to permanence with respect to something else -- an interval of time, usually of a human lifespan (i.e. scars, tattoos, etc). What about ideas? Stories and philosophy? Myths, legends, and knowledge go back thousands of years, so they’re permanent, right? Well yes, but only with respect to our species. 

We can go even deeper and say that matter and time aren't permanent either because it's only with respect to our universe (time not existing before Big Bang).

If life isn’t permanent, then clearly death is. Death is permanent...isn’t it? 

Well, only with respect to the linearity of time. Humans are 3-dimensional beings, where time only goes in one direction. But if we try to think bidirectionally and if we define death as unconscious nonexistence, then wouldn’t that mean we were dead before we were born? If time went backwards, then life would come from death. Benjamin button style. Death would, therefore, not be permanent according to the universe. The only permanent thing is impermanence.

Well if nothing is permanent and we all die in the end, then what’s the point of life? Seems pretty Nihilistic. Who cares, right? We all die, nothing matters. That’s a pretty shit way to live life -- without meaning or purpose.

&amp;#x200B;

Marcus Aurelius’s original intent behind his theme on permanence was likely in the context of  detachment from things. From possessions, fame, fortune -- that kind of permanence. For when your favorite mug breaks or a pandemic strikes, or losing a loved one. 

But for the type of permanence that that I'm getting at, Seneca’s Letters from a Stoic can help us answer that question. in Seneca’s 65th letter he kind of delves into permanence in a long, convoluted way. 

&amp;#x200B;

Reason

In this letter he and some friends are debating the root causes of all thing, they used a sculptor and his statue as an example. In this discussion Seneca analyzes the thinking of Aristotle and Plato. Aristotle says there are four causes: matter, the workman, the form, and the purpose of the work as a whole. Plato adds a 5th cause to this: the pattern or “the idea”.

Seneca disagrees and argues that there is only one cause, something that supersedes all other cause with no dependence on matter or time. Something that is truly permanent. And that one sole thing, is creative reason or logos.

I didn’t understand this at first and I still don’t but as I thought about it, I went back to my original question of, ""what is permanent?"" Are the laws of physics permanent? Well only with respect to our universe. Physics could be different in other universes. Ok what about math? And then that’s where it hit me. 

MATH. Is 1+1=2 permanent? Our ability to perform basic arithmetic or our logic/logos is our ability to reason. Other universes may have different physics, dimensions or representations of logic, but the underlying foundation of math and logic are absolute and immutable. Reason describes the structure of truth. 

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion

It makes sense that stoicism is a philosophy based upon logic and reason. It’s the one thing that makes us human. It’s what gives our life meaning. Our reason and purpose in everything that we do is what matters. Not the outcome or external things that result from it. Sisyphus pushing a boulder up a hill just to have it roll back down again every day represents our lives. It’s meaningless. But Sisyphus rolling up that boulder with purpose and focusing on that one task every day with a smile on his face is what gives life meaning.

1,"15 points that compress so much (for me) I am sure none of this is earth-shattering, but it rocked me as a bunch of pieces all fell into place as I was showering one day.

What follows is the sudden product of a long journey of journalling, reading and thinking. It will not map as vividly to your own mindset and precepts as it did mine.

As such, I offer it here in hope it can be a useful schema in your own development. So, in 15 points:

1. You will tend to regret (or regret more) the things you did not do.

2. Therefore it always makes sense to do the right kind of things.

3. The right kind of things are the inklings, hopes and notions in your mind that are recurrent, stable and persistent yet rarely engrossing or distracting.

4. This is because these things come from the stable and long-term aspects of your character, not your moment-to-moment lusts or hungers.

5. When you undertake the right kind of action, the consequences - good or bad - will make sense because they will accord with your values. You may invite grief by acting thus, but the grief will be meaningful.

6. As you conduct yourself this way, the proportion of your life that is meaningful to you will increase in line with how much of it is the consequence of your previous values-based choices.

7. Given all this, it is imperative you find - or find signs of - your values as soon as possible.

8. And then begin acting on these as soon as possible afterwards.

9. Always with a mind to know them more precisely as you evolve and your values become clearer.

10. Because, like it or not, your life circumstances are the product of your previous choices.

11. Because, whether or not you're aware of it, the older you get, the more of your life is the product of your past choices.

12. It is thus wisdom and maturity to accept this and accept that you are responsible for all the of the reasonably foreseeable consequences of your actions.

13. Thus it makes sense to seek to live without regrets - both of action and omission.

14. Yet, as no one is all-knowing, senseless hazard will still visit upon your wise life.

15. But, if you have enough wisdom, any turbulence will be a minor and temporary, lost in the vast calm of that is the estate of a wise life.

&amp;#x200B;

These and the relationships between them are still under development on this end. Nevertheless, done is better than perfect, and I hope some of the above is useful in your pursuit of wisdom."
1,"Abandoned messages on social media Ah, many times I started writing a paragraph to someone about how strongly I remembered this single thing they said years ago, and how I made that a part of my own, and how much a difference it had made to my life. How fondly I remember my time with them as classmates, colleagues, or just as friends, and how it soothed the passing of time. How, alongside splitting the bill for a lunch held thirty minutes ago, I would like to tell them how much I enjoyed it, how it refueled me with much-needed joy to share spaghetti with them.

And how many times I’ve abandoned those messages. How I’d just stick to the formal part; splitting the bill or silence altogether. Because I’d be certain they wouldn’t remember such a moment or didn’t catch the feeling. Unsure whether I could say such a thing, because it’s not something people do — so out-of-the-blue, so unsolicited. I’d convince myself it’s better to delete what I just wrote and forget about it.

And in such a moment I’d lose that opportunity of friendship.

Because every time I *did* proceed sending such messages, it brought joy to the person whom I was grateful for — which brought even more joy to me."
1,"What would a Stoics view be on dealing with crappy people involved in child’s life? I’m going through a divorce and it’s been incredibly painful. My soon to be ex husband has turned into a completely cold and hateful person towards me. Ive accepted I can’t control that, but I can’t seem to wrap my head around another issue. 

He and my friend, who was also our neighbor, had an affair. She was never a good friend, she was also never a great person. So, I am not terribly surprised but it hurt all the same. Neither of them care. They are both pretty inconsiderate, selfish people and they really don’t care about others feelings, only their own. 

They are now together and in our custody stipulation it says that we shall not introduce the kids to any significant other until they’ve been together 6 months. So, in 6 months, I’m sure she’ll make her way around the kids and I can’t help but be insanely worried about that. I don’t want her around the kids. It makes me feel incredibly uneasy, and I know I can’t do anything about that. So my question is... what would a stoics approach be here? I know I have control over being a great mom, and I’ll never stop being exactly that. But what can I do here? What should I do?"
1,"Stoicism on Attachment I just posted one about Sex, which got me thinking about Attachment, as I am currently struggling with feeling attached to a girl who just broke my heart.

What is the Stoic view on attachment and perhaps my situation?"
1,"Stoicism and Christianity I am new to this sub, so I apologize if this topic has already been discussed in-depth. 

I consider myself a Christian. I do not attend church, but I believe in the teachings of Jesus and striving to lead a virtuous life while treating others with love and respect. I am also somewhat new to stoicism, but I am drawn to many of its teachings as well.

My main question: is it possible to lead a life following the teachings of Jesus, and also as a stoic? The key difference I see is that Christianity teaches you to seek God for help during crisis, whereas stoicism teaches you to look within yourself and realize what you can and cannot control. Perhaps I’m thinking about this incorrectly, or these two ideas are not mutually exclusive. I’d love some insight from those more versed in stoicism than me.

More specifically: I’ve read Letters From a Stoic and Meditations so far. I very much enjoyed Meditations. Christianity was young during Marcus’s reign. How did he view the new religion? Did he support persecution of early Christendom as some previous rulers had? Based on his writings, I have a hard time believing he would tolerate harsh treatment of other humans (except perhaps where their behavior violated Roman law). I also think that biblical authors who lived during the time of Rome would have been aware of stoicism, and probably applied it to their lives as well. There are multiple scriptures that seem to represent a stoic philosophy.

This passage makes me think of the many lotteries I've won. Being born in a safe, stable country, with lots of opportunities. Any intelligence I have. My upbringing and environment. These are all things that instinctively stir up confidence or even pride at times. 

And yet, none of it is really my doing. Even my ability to reason is probably tied to factors that I didn't ""earn"".

Sometimes I struggle to see where the line is drawn. Can I really say that anything about myself is virtuous and not just luck and circumstance?"

1,"Thoughts on C. G. Jung? Having finished all of his majors works I can't help but feel he offers a lot of unintenrional stoic wisdom particularly in ""Modern man in search of a soul"". Anyone else share this feeling and can recommend other books in the same vein as I found Jung extremely enlightening."

1,"Can anyone describe what Marcus Aurelius means when he suggests living like ""Nature""? My confusion comes when I think about the Taoist Non-Action which suggests is living in accordance with nature, does not use rational thought.

Yet The Meditations is filled with suggestions  to use Rational thought.

Can anyone help me understand what he means by ""Nature""."
1,"Food for thought READ!!!! Marcus Aurelius's meditations have surfaced again in my mind. And I got to say, I had an almost eureka moment. There is this passage that reads, "" Body, Soul, Mind. To the body belongs sense perceptions, to the soul impulses, and to the mind judgements."" Now there is always this saying that one must conquer the mind before one can conquer the body. While this is true, often times the soul is left out of the equation. As a christian myself, I know that soul is our true pure essence. That when we die, everything else stays on earth but our soul. If I believe that as many do too, then if impulses belong to the soul, then our impulses to do wrong, think ill of others, and other shitty stuff, our body which receives sense perceptions facilitate this and we act wrongly. But this is where the mind comes in. The mind that owns judgement, then we have the ability to say no, as hard as that may be. Turn away from it,  it causes harm. Then slowly but surely, our soul will not be as corrupted because you abstain from those acts, thoughts or whatever else. And soon enough this will train the body to look at provocative, seductive things and not get a reaction from you because your soul is cleansing itself while your ""directing mind"" is judging for you. So what we have to practice and master is controlling your mind. Once you do that, whatever bad impulse the soul sends through your sense perceptions (body), the mind can say NO! and counteract such impulse, and as a result your soul will slowly shy away from that and will return to what the ""Gods"" wanted: A virtuous life. I do not know if this made sense at all, but I hope to at least get your minds thinking about this."
1,"How do I deal with guilt? I met some online friends, and last night I made a joke that really didn’t go over well. It was a grotesque subject, and though it sounds like a big deal I don’t see how they reacted the way they did. Regardless, I feel guilty. It may not be fair, but if the joke offended them then thats just the way they are and I respect that. How should I deal with my feelings of guilt?

1,"When should I worry about the future? Long time lurker (this sub has really been a positive force in my life!), I've recently been pondering the ideal of separating what you can and cannot control and attempting not to look at the outcomes of things we cannot control. However a problem I have come across often is discerning what is and is not in my control, I admit this it partially fueled by my anxiety but for example getting a flat tire the the other day. Well, yeah I guess that was sorta out of my control, but maybe if I had been more observant perhaps I could have prevented it? 

Or something like flying to Germany next summer to see my girlfriend. Maybe I'll get in despite covid, maybe I won't. I tell myself I have no control of the outcome then I begin to wonder if doing research, planning, and everything else under the sun now may decide the final result. I could go on but I think you get the idea. How does one decide in theirs lives what warrants ""worry"" and what should just be left up to the fates?"

A couple of years ago I realized I was a negative person: my interactions with people were truly negative. That realization set me free. I was causing misery in my life for no good reason. I realized I get to choose how to react when things don’t go my way. Why sweat it when you can’t control bad things that happen to you? 

I have several questions but thought I’d first ask: what does it mean to be a practicing stoic? I’m wondering if becoming a practicing stoic can help me.

1,"Brutal Schedules and Stoicism Hey everyone. I am a first year postgraduate resident, currently doing my specialty in Orthopaedics &amp; Traumatology. And it’s hard. It’s brutally hard. 

My schedule is usually working around 20 hours a day, with 4 hours to sleep on the good days. I have no free time to relax or do any activities outside of hospital stuff, and while inside the hospital I am at the bottom of the food chain and am basically treated like shit. Have been called anything from a retard to “we don’t see you as a human, first year residents are more like ants, you just have to go and work”. 

With every day that passes I feel worse, more tired, my mind feels like it’s ready to break at any moment. You can’t whine or complain cause that only makes it worse, and if you don’t like it “you are always free to quit.” Which I don’t want to do because the hospital I am at is probably the best to learn, but you need to survive this first year.

I’ve been trying to keep in mind things like Memento Mori but it doesn’t help much; if I knew I was to die tomorrow would I be doing this? Hell no. It’s an investment. The investment to be a top orthpaedics surgeon. The hardest investment I’ve done.

I need ideas to maintain a better attitude and basically to not want to fucking die half the time, which is hard on the days when you’ve slept less than 3 hours, haven’t showered in two days, haven’t had time to brush your teeth, and one of your superiors comes and tell you that you are a lazy piece of shit because you didn’t do the one thing they asked you to do (while still having 100 other things to do.)

-Just because my parents don’t understand my outlook on life, doesn’t mean they’re right or wrong; only different.

-I am in charge of my philosophical journey. If I am going to grow, I must take the steps that lead me to the destination I want to arrive at.

-Just because I can’t find or don’t have a mentor, doesn’t mean I can’t continue to learn and grow. 

-Resenting the past isn’t changing it. I need to learn to change how I judge past events.

-I understand the concept of judgment value, I need to learn how to practice and apply changing the value of my judgements.

-I don’t need to be anxious about believing differently from my friends. Their beliefs are not in my control, nor are mine in theirs. They accept me for who I am and I shouldn’t ask for any more.

-Just because I feel incompetent doesn’t mean that the work I’ve done/the knowledge I do have isn’t worthless. 

-I must continue to remind myself that pure happiness isn’t the goal, contempt and virtue is.

-I need to learn to love myself so that I can move on to loving others in a way that isn’t crutched by self-loathing. 

-No matter how long my relationship with my best friend has lasted, it is entirely possible for him to outgrow me. That is not in my hands, so it’s ok.

-As much as I want to be in the future, there is only ever now and I need to learn to live in it more often."

1,"The Daily Stoic and Ryan Holiday: their Unstoic Unreliability Long story short: they took my money, never delivered my order, apologised for their mistake and said they would issue a refund, and then have proceeded to completely ghost me while never delivering their promise for a refund.

Here's a timeline of the events: 

**Oct 18th**: Item ordered.

**Dec 3rd**: I send them a mail asking what happened with my order, and whether they haven't forgotten about it.

**Dec 5th**: Since I never received a mail saying they shipped the item, I ask them to cancel the order altogether because I know longer want it.

**Dec 9th**: I send them another mail asking if I'm to assume that I'll be seeing neither my money nor the item I ordered, because of their total silence on the matter.

They reply back on the same day with this:

&gt; We sincerely apologize for the delay here. It looks like we missed your initial inquiries and have received your most recent email. We had some fulfillment issues with a previous fulfillment center we are no longer working with which caused a delay/miscommunication about your order. We are working on getting tracking for your order now and would be happy to issue a refund for the shipping cost of your order as the very least. However if you still wish for a full refund, we completely understand. Please let us know if you would prefer the full refund at this time or if you have any additional questions. Thank you and we hope to hear from you soon!

I then reply positively, thanking them for the offer to refund the shipping cost, and ask them when I might realistically expect to receive the item.

**Dec 14th**: I send them a mail, asking them if my mail got through. I'm wondering about this, because in the one and only reply I ever received from them, they alluded to not receiving my other mails and only receiving the latest.

**Dec 16th**: due to the ongoing total silence, I let them know that I want them to cancel the order altogether and issue a full refund.

**Everyday from this point on, once a day**, I have been sending small one line emails, hoping that they are ignoring me not out of malice but by a genuine technical error of some sort due to which they are somehow not receiving my emails.

**Other steps I have taken to try to contact them**: 

- tried DMing both Ryan Holiday and Daily Stoic on Instagram, but I assume that they probably get flooded with DMs which is why they never opened my messages.

- tried forwarding the email thread both to Ryan Holiday's Gmail address, as well as to the other Daily Stoic contact mail address (""info"" rather than ""store""). 

- tried contacting /u/ryan_holiday directly on reddit, both with a DM and a comment mention, assuming that he probably receives way less notifications on reddit than he does on Instagram so I should have a fair chance of obtaining some kind of response this way. But no: he was active in the last day as his post history shows, which is honestly making me wonder whether or not I am being ghosted intentionally. Still, I am patient, assuming outstanding incompetence and failure to do good, rather than unstoic ill intentions to steal. 

I am running out of ideas on what to do. Got any tips? 

Some of you might want to tell me that money is an external, that it's no big deal, that I should just let go of my 44 dollars and take it as a lesson not to get tricked into buying overpriced trinkets (though my initial intention was to thank the Daily Stoic by buying their merchandise, rather than seeing value in the merchandise itself; obviously I've lost that feeling towards them now). 

**To these people I reply that it's not the money that is my concern, but justice.**

I'm not angry, I'm not all that attached to the lost money, even though I would of course prefer it if I got it back: my main desire right now is to encourage justice, to encourage standards of behaviour, especially coming from people who claim to follow Stoic principles. 

Whether ill intentions or outstanding incompetence, the Daily Stoic ought to hang their heads in shame for how they are (not) dealing with my situation."
1,"Grateful Just wanted to share that stoicism has helped me alot. In the past years, I’ve always been the anxious person whose always afraid of anything. I’m not always good with handling difficult people and situations but upon reading about stoicism and slowly applying it to my life, my fears have decreased even if the challenges that i’m facing is still the same. I became more grateful about life and finding my own peace which is rare. In the next year, I plan to continue my stoicism journey and hopefully strengthen my new found values and principles."
1,"My mental framework, a bit similar to stoicism When I was a teen, I looked at my life as a sine wave(like this - 〰️). My explanation was that, if my pursual of happiness/success was large, the level of anguish/hurt/disappointment would be large too. So I mentally recalibrated myself to not pursue anything too much. To not be obsessed. To passively react instead of actively engage. 

In my 20s I got a bit more ambitious. I opened myself up a bit and pursued a few things more seriously. Even then, I never dived deep into almost any aspects of my life, career, relationships etc. I was always as close to the surface as I could, so that if something went wrong, I could pull myself out of the water quickly. I always had and have an escape route. 

I also make it a point to never celebrate success so that I would be able to endure failure. 

I don't really know if my mental framework is right. Don't know how to measure it's worthiness. 

I don't really know what made me adopt this approach. May be it's a coping mechanism to too many disappointments growing up? I did do something as a teen which left me a lot ashamed with my friends though.

Thank you for reading my post.  Sorry if it seemed like a ramble."
1,"How do you actually practice being indifferent to externals? Anybody else find stoicism slightly impractical? I totally understand the dichotomy of control, and the consequences of overvaluing or becoming dependent on externals. 

Putting your happiness in things outside your control is a recipe for disaster and all suffering is a result of not being able to accept what is. 

I get it and it makes perfect sense. 

Here’s my issue though. HOW do you do it. HOW do you actually practice it? This is a question that I have yet to find an answer to. 

I’m a private music teacher and it would do my students no good to explain why theory, technique, and understanding your scales and chords are important if I didn’t give them step by step exercises to practice these concepts."

During a challenging time in my life, I found a lot of inner peace through the Stoic practice of contemplating death. It turns out a few friends had the same experience, so we decided to create an app to help others explore this practice.

After a year of development, we just launched the first version of Mortal on the iPhone. It has 21 original audio lessons, called “contemplations”, exploring various aspects of life, death, and mortality – many of which are inspired by Stoicism.

1,"We assign meaning to our days -- for good and not Hi all. Long-time lurker here. I was just reading up on how my country (Canada) will likely see a large spike in Covid-19 cases following Christmas. The comments in that thread contained moral justification and rationalization from those who've decided to ignore restrictions because it's Christmas. Even for some who have gone all year adhering to restrictions, this is where they draw their line.

I'm posting here to reaffirm the Stoic belief that we control our own responses to external situations. In my mind, today and tomorrow are like any other day -- I do not need a calendar to tell me when to celebrate life or to be thankful. Those are attitudes I can enact on any day.

So, for those who might find this holiday season to be tough and rough, I hope this thought offers some solace. The public response in recent months to restrictions around Halloween, Thanksgiving, and now Christmas are all about responding to external sources of meaning (i.e., tradition). In times such as ours, we must be critical of how much meaning we *choose* to give these aspects of our lives.

I wish these words could offer some comfort for those studying and practicing Stoic philosophy."

I am new around here, and I wanted to ask how I can apply Stoic principles to help me through periods of extreme emotional pain.

This is compounded by feelings of extreme isolation and loneliness (even when I am around people, I feel alone and disconnected). 

Sometimes the pain becomes so unbearable, that I wish I just didn't exist. I wish I could get some terrible disease or die in my sleep. I have been feeling this way for most of my adult life (I am almost 34 now), and it's getting to the point where I feel so helpless and miserable. In the past I have tried medication and therapy for several years, but it was not helpful for me. Please let me know if you have any advice from the Stoic perspective.

The way I see it, we have three paths forward:

1) Just keep doing what we are doing right now. I've been modding here for over a year, and I've seen more unhappy users in the last week than I had in the first 12 months here. I'm not a fan of this path.

2) Ban images again. 

3) Allow filtering between two sensibly-chosen flairs. (For technical reasons, users are pretty much limited to selecting either one flair, or everything, to view).

I think the flair option can be good if we get the flair right. Here's a few ways we might do it:

1) Beginner / Advanced

2) Inspiration / Discussion

3) Image / Text

4) Offer a single flair: ""Classical Stoicism""

Other suggestions are more than welcome.

Whenever I listen to music, any type of music, my repressed pains, frustrations, worries and problems appear in my head and get amplified.
I start thinking about them with victim mentality and get depressed. It can ruin my days. Music rarely cheers me up.

I don't know what to do anymore. I tried avoiding music altogether, but at the end began listening to music again. No matter how hard I try to avoid being triggered by music, It happens.

I even sometimes listen to music with an ""indirect"" intention of feeling that way...which is not healthy and I regret it afterwards, but do it again. It can distract me from doing daily tasks and studying sometimes.

How can I quit listening to music? What should I do?"

It’s a beautiful song all around but it also shows an acceptance of things that I would love to gain throughout life!"

1,"The holidays are super stressful and at times depressing during a good year let alone 2020. I've added a few tips which help me make the most of the season, hope this perspective helps! For me, reducing stress, anxiety, and depression during this holiday season is about eliminating negative/toxic influences and replacing them with positive and healthy ones. It also helps by staying present within awareness and being grateful for all that I have... without comparing what I had or what I did to celebrate the holidays last year - this is vital to ensuring my peace and joy through the season and beyond. 

For instance, I can't travel to be with my family this year so I will do a Zoom call... which is lame and depressing in comparison. So to help make it interesting I'll make the Zoom call more fun by playing games with my fam, (jackbox, quiplash, etc.) and putting the screen on my family room tv so I feel like they're with me instead of on my cell phone screen. It's not about which is better, being with them in person or on a webinar, but making the most of my circumstance and adapting... finding the light so to speak and residing within the positivity of that adaptation... and going one step further and being grateful for it! Many people will not even have the opportunity to have a zoom call with their family, I will. This is a BLESSING. 

Anywho, I just released a new video on YT sharing ten tips to help us all make the most of this holiday season. These tips will also help us just feel better by eliminating some stress and anxiety and help decrease the loneliness and  depression. I'm wishing you all a very peaceful and joyous holiday season!

1,"Proposed Rule Change Discussion Thread The mod team has received a lot of feedback recently, and we have two groups of people here who are unhappy with the current situation. On the one side, we have folks are are dismayed at the proliferation of less-serious posts, often image-based, which seem to have displaced the more focused discussions of the past. On the other, we have a much larger community of people who are annoyed at what they perceive as nitpicking rules that cause many of the most popular posts to be taken down, even when these posts have generated useful discussion. The more we try to navigate the middle road, the more annoyance we seem to generate from both sides.

Flairs were mentioned as a possible solution to the problem, which would hopefully allow users to filter posts and focus only on what they want.

The main obstacle to this approach is that Reddit's implementation of flair filtering is poor, and only really works nicely for filtering one sort of flair at a time. Happily, it turns out that this can work to our advantage.

Our proposal is to require posts be tagged with one of only two available flairs - **Image/Media**, or **Text**. Image/Media will include direct links to any media, including gifs, video, music, etc. Text will be text posts, which may include embedded links to whatever we would normally allow.

Users can gracefully filter out one or the other with a single click, and they can bookmark the resulting URL - you can just click on any tag now to see how it works. (Users of ""old reddit"" can use this functionally too, but in a slightly [less graceful way](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/khg167/discussion_flair_and_flair_filtering/)). Most apps support this single-flair filtering as well.

The relevance rules could be applied with a somewhat lighter hand to the image posts, allowing more general content while still disallowing memes, unattributed quotes, and stuff that's really off-topic or low-effort. Our rules will be applied more strictly to text posts.



This is not a bad idea, and crucially, we do not have a lot of other good ideas for how to make both groups happy.

Let us know what you think, how we might alter this idea, or what else we might consider. A community vote on the resulting proposal will follow shortly.

Thanks."

1,"The Shortcut to Virtue: Dichotomy of Necessity Epictetus called the Cynic way shortcut to virtue, as it was an intense regime of asceticism and poverty meant to test a person's resistance and commitment to a strong character. However, merely practicing poverty isn't really what is meant by virtue, it's the underlying principle that has the key meaning. A Cynic isn't poor merely to be poor,  the Cynic practices what I call the dichotomy of necessity. Diogenes was said to have gotten rid of his wooden cup after seeing a kid drink water with his hands cupped. It was unnecessary, thus a burden. 

This is the real practice that catapults people into wisdom: Knowing what is necessary from what is superfluous. What is required from what is unnecessary. What is meaningful from what is vapid. This applies to all the things within your control. You already know how to separate what is up to you from what isn't - now you can learn what is necessary from what can be discarded, omitted, and ignored. 

You're not going to abandon everything, wear a sack, and live homeless. What you will gain is the awareness of how much of your time and attention is spent on things you could absolutely do without that you thought mattered more than they did. And if you so choose to spend that time, or money, or keep those possessions be prepared to say ""this is my vanity, I keep this out of complacency"" in order to keep yourself honest. No need to make excuses, it's your self indulgence, nothing else. With time, if you keep your honesty about what you don't need, it will come undone painlessly."

1,"You are living the dream life Hello, today I speak on the dream life. My dream life. I am journaling on a concept introduced to me by William B. Irvine and giving my opinion about it.

Yesterday I journaled about my wish for a car. Today I am grateful for my life in general. Although humans tend to want more and more, this will never suffice. We simply want more if we don’t train our brains to think properly, naively thinking materialism will suffice for our despair and unhappiness.

Notice on how good you live, to be able to connect to me from all the parts of the globe, to be able to take an antibiotic if you catch a disease that would likely kill you 200 years ago, to celebrate Christmas and have food at the table, to be able to read and educate yourself, and so on.

Not so long ago, kings would not have plumbing in their facilities, something for us that seems pretty basic and we take that for granted. In terms of material possessions, we have so much. My life is the dream life of millions of people in, say, the past (if time travel was possible) and in more impoverished countries. 

I recognise we should be more thankful for what we have for others have wished it much more. Don’t think for what you don’t have; rather, try negative visualisation and imagine not having the things you have and how you would be that way… Be thankful. Take 1 minute of your day and use negative visualisation; then stop, and smile for what you have imagined is not true for you, but it is for many other people. Know that.

To conclude, I’ll leave you with something that sums up what I said:

&gt;""Do not indulge in dreams of having what you do not, but reckon up the chief of the blessings you do possess, and then thankfully remember how you would crave for them if they were not yours.– Meditations 7.27"""
1,"Instead of being anxious for some plausible unknown scenario, be grateful it is not happening in the now. Lately I have been feeling really anxious about plausible dark futures where I get cancer, a family member dies, I get expelled from school because someone tried to sabotage my career, etc. 

These negative thoughts all detract me from the only moment that exists, the present. I remind myself to instead feel grateful that these terrible scenarios are not happening right now."

1,"Working Christmas Hey folks! So I’m a college student who’s been trying really hard to implement stoicism into every applicable  situation. I’m currently working at a place with a pretty unlikeable, seemingly soulless boss. I’ve worked there for three years and I’ve worked Christmas every year for the past two years. I’ve also brought him multiple employees, stayed after hours, and done countless favors for this guy. This year he wants me to work Christmas and Christmas eve again even though I told him I’d really like to spend it with the fam (only immediate family this year, but still). It’s pretty hard to explain to him that Christmas is an important holiday for me (I know it is for all who celebrate) since I’ve got old grandparents who I don’t know how much time they’ve got left, and divorced parents (who are still amicable) that I really value spending time with when they’re together because he only thinks in terms of business. What’s the stoic response here? Should I suck it up and just work since his thinking/scheduling is mostly out of my control? Or should I give my two weeks notice? What would y’all do."

1,"Putting your principles into action. The first step in becoming better is understanding what better *is*. What are the principles you want to follow? What does your ideal look like?

You have to know where you are going if you ever want to get there. 

This is the easy part.

What really matters is putting those principles into action.

This is where the real work begins. Going against your animal instincts. Conquering your inner demons with rationality and consistent practice.

A Stoic is not someone that is living perfectly according to the principles. 

A Stoic is someone that is aware of his shortcomings. And is consciously and consistently taking steps towards overcoming them.

With every day that passes, a Stoic is hopefully one step closer to the ideal. 

It's a lifelong learning process. Perfecting your principles, and most importantly, putting them into action."
1,"Stoicism for a Better Life - Weekly exercise (December 23, 2020) Hello there,

Another year has come and gone. I would like to use the next few exercises to help guide you in rounding up the year and beginning the new one in a new light. To that end, next week I will end the year with a picture as opposed to a quote, so this week I would like to seek inspiration from the first and foremost Stoic teacher to be studied.

In my opinion, each and every Stoic philosopher has important teachings. As Seneca says, it is the forest of wisdom that is to our benefit. How can we distinguish one tree from the other when we are looking to absorb the fresh air of the entire forest? We can’t. However, if I were somehow limited to only one master to study for the rest of my life, or just one teacher to recommend to Prokoptons new and old, it would undoubtedly be Epictetus. Not just because he’s funny (seriously...out of 30-40 original philosophical works I have read, there are ***only two*** other ones that made me laugh out loud the way the Epictetus’s Discourse and Enchiridion did), but because Epictetus cuts right to the heart of what Stoicism is about: Control what you can as ardently as you can, and forget about the rest. This is from his Discourses II 16.2:

&gt;""Where is Good? In our reasoned choices. Where is Evil? In our reasoned choices. Where is that which is neither Good or Evil? In the things outside of our own reasoned choice.""

2020 has objectively been one of the harshest years in our modern history. Between political turmoil, huge forest fires on two continents, civil unrest in many western countries (USA and France leading the way) and...oh yeah that COVID thing, 2020 has impacted everyone in the world to varying degrees. We have all faced challenges, and even the most stoic (adverb, not philosophy) of us felt a deluge of negative emotions, depression, anxiety, fears, etc.

Having feelings, anxieties etc is a normal part of being human. As much as we try to focus on the rational mind, we exist in these imperfect and all too easily fallible vessels that react emotionally to external stimuli. So we can’t be upset over what we felt during the year...what we did when we were emotional...times we were not virtuous. We can’t control these anymore than we can control blinking. Moreover, all these moments of ignobility are in the past. Both the body’s reactions and our past choices are in the domain of that which is not dependent on us: externals.

By definition (as Epictetus reminds us so succinctly) things outside of our control cannot possibly be good or bad. How can it? It’s just luck of the draw. It may be preferred or not, but it cannot be good or bad. What can be good or bad is the judgments and choices we make now. And in the next present moment. And in the next one...ad infinitum until we have no more present moments. Life...a good life is really that simple.

**So as an exercise this week, when you are reflecting on the past year, remind yourself that everything that happened (including YOUR judgments and choices) have no impact on you today and in your future present moments, other than being a potential lesson learnt.** Look back, by all means, as we can learn from the past. Look externally, by all means, for we can only make the best possible judgments and choices with all the information available to us, which includes all externals (like our emotions and what’s happening around the world). But always recall that these are data points to learn from in helping you make good decisions now. They are not good or bad in their own right. Just data sets.

I wish you all happy holidays and the strength to view things the way you know them to be, not the way you feel them to be.

1,"Politics &amp; Stoicism Despite having read Meditations and another secondary source  'manual' by Irvine, I'm still not sure where I fall on the aspect of ignorance or apathy in Stoicism. I've been focusing a lot on politics in the last couple of weeks, even sharing my views, but isn't this against Stoic 'doctrine'? Isn't it much more Stoic to disregard such ephemera? This is especially amplified when considering other people's opinions. I often feel bad now about my caring about politics. Sometimes I feel like Stoicism just can't work. How can I be in the world and yet out of it? It's important to know the things happening in the world. Right? Wrong?"
1,"Pick your Poison We all know the poison in our life, the thing we know is wrong and yet we still end up doing it, and regretting it afterwards. 

You know that and huge project/assignment’s completion deadline is one month from now. You have 2 choice, Complete now and perfect it throughout the month or wait until the day before and pull an all nighter only to barely finish. 

The only reason you procrastinate is because you know you CAN complete it in a night. Don’t give yourself that option, it’s only hurting you and the quality of your product. 

And we know that there are times when the deadlines aren’t fair; an assignment that would take at least a month to complete to perfection is due in 2 weeks. You have to give a big presentation and you only have tonight to prepare. 

Doesn’t that kindle on the lines of Momento Mori? 

Except this time we don’t know when we’re going to die, we don’t have a deadline, we just have to know we are doing the right thing. 

Death is the ultimate deadline, don’t procrastinate. 

Just because you’ve grown a tolerance to poison doesn’t mean it’s good for you. 

As Stoics we know that when “picking your poison” the only correct option is no poison at all."
1,"A request for a nice quote. Hello all.

I find that I like the thought of carrying with me, something that reminds me daily of my committment to the practices of Stoicism.
I have bought a locket that I will wear as a necklace. (I don't like carry extra things in my purse or handbag).

The locket is currently empty but I want to add a quote inside. Not engraved, but a piece of paper that I can fold/concertina and have with me.
There are of course, lots of great quotes. Can you recommend one that resonates with you? 

Thanks"
1,"I am in need of help. Desperately. I will try and keep this as short and concise as possible. If anyone would be interested in more details I have made many posts in various subreddits. 

I have battled self-hate and depression my entire life. Ever since I Could remember my mind would constantly remind me that I am not good enough. Growing up however I was focused on goals. Things like doing well in school and athletics. While I battled my self-hate and the idea that literally everyone I meet is better than me I move forward in life. I did well enough in school to be accepted to a decent college and I played sports throughout high school and college. I was social and did well in nearly every aspect of my life. 

Even through college the idea that everyone has it figured out and is better than me was there but I firmly believe that my goal oriented lifestyle and doing what I enjoyed truly kept it at bay. 

Fast forward a few years. I am 31 the last few years I have no lived life. I truly hate myself. I got into alcohol and drug use and have done things in the past that I truly cannot forgive myself for. I am in constant fear of this coming to life. They were of a sexual nature when I was drunk and high. I didn't hurt anybody which is the only thing that I can hag my hat on.

I pushed all the woman I have loved in my life away because I convinced myself that I will eventually let me down and hurt them. I was lonely and desperate. I have been sober for over a month for the first time since I can remember and I am trying to tackle the idea of progressing in life. Being in the moment, not worrying about what ifs and I simply can't. I have tried everything.

I feel like my life is over. I take stock of my life from a ration position and I truly am the biggest loser I know. Worst part is I had every advantage anyone could ask for. I don't have any physical or mental ailments that hinder me in pursuing whatever it is I want to do.

now, there is evidence out there of how disgusting I was acting while doing drugs. The only idea that brings me any solace is death. Not 'memento mori' but I am hoping I die soon. I would have committed suicide last year if it weren't the pain it would cause my mother. It is so hard for me to do anything positive as all I think about is my past, and how it defines me as less of a man. I am simply tired. 

I rambled and was a bit incoherent. Thanks for reading."

How do you view *thinking of the worst* ? Is it stoic or not?

I know that a stoic should balance his mood (aka not being too happy) by visualizing bad things. Also, a good stoic should be aware of the things he can control and those he cannot. Now, for an important event in the future, how a stoic should act?

2. I want to utilize the time I have and be less distracted.

3. I want to learn the art of not giving a fuck ( don't want to care what people think about me )

4. Be mindful of what I'm saying to another person.

And my main goal is to live every day to the fullest without a single regret of wasting time.

He answered telling me it's useless that I try to study if I can't pay his course since If I'm ""that poor"" I won't  be able to afford education of any kind. I was feeling very uncomfortable and angry because of his assumptions, but I tried to remain polite. I just thanked him for his answer and left the chat shortly after.

1,"Is it at all contradictory to follow Stoic principles and be an anti-natalist? I have been applying Stoic principles to my life and way of thinking for a few years now, but one school of thought I have always heavily advocated is anti-natalism. In my own opinion I believe it is immoral to have children as in the modern world procreation serves little more purpose than to fulfil a desire for pleasure or purpose (if one should feel they are lacking it) and if we are to do that which is good and virtuous - which of course is all entirely subjective based on the individual - then from my perception to have children is to act selfishly.

In that same vein, we live in a world rife with unnecessary suffering. For a large part of my adult life I grew to resent my own existence as it was not my choice to be born to grow up in today's capitalist society in which people are valued more for time and labour than they are as individuals, and have to work the majority of their lives to merely survive. If I am to do what is in my perception is good and virtuous then I could not in good conscience make the choice to bring another life into this world for them to experience the same suffering I have endured. I know that we all need to find meaning and purpose in our suffering, but for the most part suffering is an unnecessary evil and to create life knowing full well that it will one day suffer as well is quite the opposite of virtuous in my opinion.  


This is my justification at least for being an ant-natalist. Does it in any way contradict Stoic philosophy?"

1,"How do you plan your day as a stoic? Virtue maximization? I am new to the concept of stoicism and trying to wrap my mind around it. I am confused about virtue being the goal, not pleasure. How do you plan your day then? 

I am not trying to mock stoics, but with my current understanding of virtue as the goal, I can imagine something along these lines by reductio ad absurdum: ""Hm, how can I be more courageous today? Guess I could save a kitten from a tree. Ok, next: how can I become wiser? Let's read this book on European history"" And so on. Apart from planning on fulfilling your well-defined duties, of course, such as going to work and cooking dinner for your children.

And how do you even choose among the many ways of pursuing a virtue if not by measuring subjective pleasure? For example, in pursuing wisdom I might have a preference towards reading history vs. physics. What to choose as a stoic?

And where do you even stop? Is donating monthly to charity enough when you can actually make your whole life about charity like Mother Therese? Does pursuing virtue have an end? You can always do more!

1,"Question on Meditations 5:26 Meditations 5:26  
The mind is the ruler of the soul. It should remain unstirred by agitations of the flesh—gentle and violent ones alike. Not mingling with them, but fencing itself off and keeping those feelings in their place. When they make their way into your thoughts, through the sympathetic link between mind and body, don’t try to resist the sensation. The sensation is natural. But don’t let the mind start in with judgments, calling it “good” or “bad.”  


I feel like the second half of the quote is in contrast with the first(I'm sure I'm misunderstanding it). In the first part he calls for not mingling, but rather fencing off feelings/temptation. But in the second half he calls for not resisting or judging the sensation?"

&gt;**""If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself but your own estimate of it; and these you have the power to revoke at any moment. If the cause of trouble lies in your own character, set about reforming your principles. - Meditations 8.47""**

&amp;#x200B;

**Discipline of judgement**

Today I journal about the discipline of judgement and to that matter, I use a quote from MA.

&amp;#x200B;

Anything we have, or feel, that’s an impression of anything external. Love, desire, fear, and so on.

Just before writing this, I wanted a car. I still do, I would say that the desire of wanting a car led me to search on and on in youtube about all the models and types, I would say I have become obsessed in some way to the cars. 

But I know that my desire is from a thing external that may never happen, so I make my peace with it. I won’t let it control my life.

I have the discipline to know that anything that stresses us, as the quote goes, is not inherent but from the outside and we have the power to stand up “I won’t tolerate more bad behaviour to my mind. Enough is enough. Enough is right now.” And then, just stop letting the car control you. 

&amp;#x200B;

I advise you to read the quote, and again. Reflect upon the meaning of it. If you feel bad because you have done something wrong or failed at the work today, or someone insulted you... what can you do about but make peace with it?

Don't rethink past or overthink future(like I did in the car example) but rather have the courage to be in the present, revoking all the impressions that may cause you trouble.

I wanting a car and the fact that I am thinking of it all the time are not going to buy me a car. So I have 2 options: continue in my procrastination or work for it. If the work is impossible to do, say, you are still 17 and can't do anything about it, then stop. It's not in your control and if are to have one, or the perfect one, or your favourite one, you'll get it, when the time comes right."

1,"Character is Key “Plato, Aristotle, and a host of other philosophers, all destined to take different paths, derived more from Socrates’ character than from his words” - Letters from a Stoic, Letter VI

Seneca implies to Lucilius that no matter your words, no matter what you write, the real thing people learn from is your character. 

All of what was written from Socrates’ teachings is still extremely insightful, but we’re it not for his curiosity that was only shown through his character that we know the benefits and costs of questioning. 

A philosopher isn’t someone who just writes insightful things, it’s a person who acts upon his insight. 

Marcus Aurelius practiced his philosophy, we know that whenever he had unphilosophical thoughts he’d go straight to his journal to affirm to himself that he, in fact, is a Stoic. 

Seneca had a journal, but most importantly, Seneca had a true friend in Lucilius. 

It’s not always a journal, its not always a person.

You character defines you more than your words do."

1,"Death in Harness Stoicism is a philosophy that helps us build better lives and be more productive overall, that’s why I started aspiring to become a stoic philosopher. 

In one of seneca’s letters to lucilius he states that a man should die in harness. a man should be so engrossed in his work, his philosophy that when death approaches, he is happy with all that he has achieved.

in the same letter seneca mentions that it may seem that he is at a current inactive state in his life, but in reality he’s still working relentlessly. He only slept because his body forced him to, otherwise his whole day is him studying and advising. He found meaning in life by doing that. 

Not all of us can find a robust meaning like seneca did, but all we can do is try. We don’t have to die working our 9-5, our last breath doesn’t need to be in the office. Seneca didn’t earn any money doing what he loved, so we shouldn’t expect our meaning to also be materialistic.

In Ancient Rome, the worst curse a person can wish upon their enemy is the curse of waiting for death. Falling sick again and again, but always recovering, waiting for death, only a step away and yet you’re crippled. 

As stoics we don’t want to die, we accept that is a natural feature of life, so because of the acceptance of this, we want to make the most of our short time on earth, after which we will be forgotten.

1,"Help with Stress and Anger Hi guys,

I used to be able to control my feelings and be a strong stoic. But this year has just been getting worse and worse for me and the stress at work has accumulated to the breaking point where my discipline has lead to some aggressive lashing out. I dunno what to do honestly as now I have reached a point where I am filled with Anxiety, Hate and Anger. The complete opposite of who I was a year ago. Honestly, I just terrified how quickly I have changed when I hit my lowest point. I still have the old values, it's just that I think all these other feelings are taking over and seeing their share during day time. I was hoping to receive some advice and Wisdom here or a reference to a passage that will help me get back the Stoic ways. I have gone through a lot and at first, I thought the boiling was natural but deep down I know its wrong since it sadens me. Please help a bro get back on track!"

1,"Visualization exercise I kind of made up to remind myself that much of my mind is not reality Note: I came up with this on my bed but maybe this is jsut called a certain form of meditation? I’m not claiming I invented this haha

“We suffer more from imagination than reality” - seneca

I had an epiphany one day when I was alone in my dark room.

I closed my eyes and envisioned a scary creature at the side of my bed.

The fear grew and eventually I had to just look in that direction to ease my mind - even though I knew there obviously wasn’t a creature there.

However I had an aha moment.

This could be an exercise that serves as a reminder of how the mind is just an illusion and can trigger emotions if you aren’t being mindful. 

I lay at the center of my bed.

To the right I close my eyes and envision something that creates fear spiders crawling up My bed, etc - open my eyes, see that it’s not there and fear is gone.

To the left, I close my eyes and envision something that would make me sad (the ghost of my father at the edge of the bed) - open my eyes and nothing is there.

Finally, I lay with my head straight up to the ceiling and focus on my breathing.

This is reality. I am simply in an empty room. My mind is an illusion."
1,"Negative visualization tool: Premature Eulogies This is something I've kinda done my whole life, and just recently realized how powerful of a tool it can be when done right. A lot of posts here ask about death, and how you can accept it's inevitability; both for you and your loved ones. The practice is simple: If you find yourself upset by the prospect of someone's death(including yourself) think about what you would say at that person's funeral. This can trick your brain into thinking that they are already dead, and help you accept their mortality; and move on. You don't have to physically write it down(I don't), and I wouldn't suggest sharing the fact that you're doing this with the person, just think about it. Envision yourself wearing your nice clothes, in a church or wherever, looking at that person in a burial container. Think about what you would say, both to that person, and to that person's loved ones. With practice, you'll find it more and more easier to think about and process death as an external.

This practice has the added benefit of you appreciating that person more, because as a Stoic you truly understand how inevitable death is, and that it can come for any of us at any time. 

An important caveat to note: don't overdo it, as far as your emotional capacity goes. If you find it too upsetting, stop. Negative visualization, as well as Stoicism as a whole, is a muscle, and takes time and practice to develop. 

Cheers."

1,"""Whoever is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city."" Proverbs 16:32, The Bible I noticed this first when reading *Lessons in Stoicism* by John Sellars, but there are a number of common threads and parallels between many Stoic principles and those found in the Bible (specifically the wisdom literature - Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Job). I read this verse today and it strongly reminded me of what I've read so far pertaining to Stoicism.  


That being said, I think you all would find Ecclesiastes an intriguing read if you're into ancient literature, which I assume many of you are if you're interested in Stoicism! I highly recommend it.

1,"Grieving and the grieving process I have learned to use the grieving process to help me deal with losses. I use Kubler-Ross' Denial, Anger, Bargaining, and Acceptance. I have found it helpful for me. 

I recently had a close friend and a relative die. I felt OK about the friend and not OK about my relative. I keep thinking about missed opportunities with my relative. 

My point: I recently listened to an interview with William Irvine. He mentioned the grieving process and asked why would someone want to feel all those negative feelings for months or even longer when they could not feel any negative feelings at all. He then described 'grieving' as feelings of guilt and remorse. If we engage fully in our relationships with those who are in our lives, we will not feel guilt nor remorse when they die. 

I had not heard of this before. I can see how I felt no guilt or remorse with my friend who died but I did feel remorse with my relative. Anyone else have a take on what Irvine was talking about? Thanks."

1,"How do I approach the thought of suicide with calm Hello.

I have posted here before and it's been colorful.

Something a little different from me.

I am pretty sure I am going to die by my own hand. Don't worry, I won't ask for methods or something like that. I am actually planning to do it legally, just have to move to the right country, it would take a year or two, but hey, at least I don't have to hide my intentions. 

What I want is not to be emotional about the past, i find myself ruminating what could have happened if this was different, that, if I made that choice. I cry and get mad for doing that to kid me, I still see that little me crying, what did he do to be get what he got. (it's a long story)

I don't want to dwell on what could have been, what's done, is done. I either have to live with it or die (I chose this option).

Stoics accept suicide as an option, that is why I am not against it, but I have my issues with it, being living according to nature and virtues. Objectively, that can't be pinpointed, if at all.

But acceptance is what I agree with, but my stubborn nature always wonders why? I lived by the notion live and let live, I still got picked on, others trying to direct my life and generally shit like my health issues, finances etc.

Well, the time has come to accept things my way, nobody can direct me if I am dead, I don't have the biological burdens, society's burdens and the of my own desires. 

Can't make the right or wrong choice, the true sens of freedom for me.

Why does society even care if an adult wants to die, they go through lengths to stop you with psychiatry coercion... Do I bring in so much taxes? Haha.

I want to go into that process calm and not to focus on the what ifs and the past, I want to go to rest relaxed and content that the end of this for me horrible ride is near."

1,"Suffering is truly a choice A few days ago, I took LSD with some of my friends and ended up contemplating philosophy for a lot of it, experiencing ego death, and what I would consider a state of enlightenment and came to some conclusions, here is what I learned.

No two people have the same perspective, due to the nature of language, it is impossible to be sure that someone has the same experience or perspective as you no matter how much they say they do. Most people would agree that grass is green, yet what to me is “green” could appear to someone else as what I interpret as “blue.” Though it is “green” to both of us, I can never truly know what they see, unless I were to become them. 

From this I realized that so much of my life is based on the opinions of others, and so is that of many others. In one moment, I may find myself suffering because of a perceived loss. Why am I suffering? Perhaps I lost my phone, or my car was wrecked, or something was stolen from me... are these things inherently worthy of suffering over? A stoic would tell you those things are indifferent, and they are. I suffer because I tell myself the things that happened are bad, but why do I do this? 

I realized that in this scenario, I think these things are bad simply because it’s generally agreed upon, other people think it’s bad, so I should too right? No. What’s to stop me from labeling this things as good, instead? Why should I allow anyone to tell me when I ought to suffer? 

All suffering is a product of perspective.

There are people who have less than you do, who live more difficult lives than you do, who have been born into circumstances that would cause you to suffer if you were to be placed into them now, but they are happier than you are. Why?

So much of the modern human experience is constructed, artificial, and completely subjective. Even the reality we experience does not truly exist in the way you think it does. There is no objective reality, because every living being perceives it differently.

Infinity: all things that ever have, will, or might exist. The mantra occurred to me: “Be at peace, for all things are, none of them good nor bad.” 

Recently, my entire life was turned on its head. I was given a weeks notice to leave my place of residence, removed from an organization I had to devoted the last three months of my life to trying to become a part of, having to say goodbye to everyone I know and love, and move to a different state to live with a family member with whom my relationship is troubled. I find my depression creeping towards me once more.

Yet, I do not suffer. I do not want. I need only what my body requires. I do not fear. 

How? Why? Because I simply choose not to. When I find myself experiencing negative emotions, I acknowledge them, but do not label them as good or as bad, and eventually they pass. Nothing can happen my mind, nothing can harm my soul, unless I choose to be harmed. My body may be harmed by circumstances outside of my control, and if that happens I will do what I can to mend my wounds. What else can I do? Suffering does not cause my condition to improve, so why should I?

1,"It's hard maintaining conflict boundaries in a relationship There's no need to attend every argument to which we are invited. But in practice, sometimes it's hard to tell when I'm cutting a conflict too short at the expense of my partner or if I'm maintaining healthy boundaries by not continuing the conversation further.

It can feel like the issues have been discussed and yet to do harm by exiting the conversation. It can be even worse to have actually addressed the problems as well as we can, but we keep talking, finding new things to fight about, letting our hot states lead the way.


That boundary: when to participate in a conflict and when to not participate is so hard to articulate beforehand, see in real-time, and practice appropriately.

1,"How do stoics view childhood abuse? I first learned about stoicism many years ago. I've tried applying the philosophy to my own life on and off throughout the years. However, there are some principles that i just don't know if are compatible with my own life. Mainly ones about how ""if an assault hasn't harmed your character, then it hasn't harmed you at all"" or  how people who commit evil acts harm themselves more than the victim.

I won't go into details, but I was subject to pretty severe abuse as a child, which resulted in trauma that I've been dealing with my entire adult life. I'm not sure if the statement about ""a harmed character"" applies here, because the events in my childhood definitely caused me to become a bitter, angry person. I grew up without being taught any basic social skills and only learned how to verbally abuse others and be violent. As a result, I spent most of my youth being an asshole to everyone and treating people in ways that I'm now deeply ashamed of. 

How would stoics advise a victim of childhood abuse to view their past? Is there any way to be ""stoic"" about a stolen childhood and abusers who never faced justice? Thanks in advance for any insights."

1,"New Years's message today, i wanted to share a short lesson from Marcus Aurelius as this new year approaches. In his meditations, he lets us know that the our mental faculties most likely than not, will not keep up with out physical conditions. The minds tends to deteriorate before we live the latter part of our lives. This is why he counsels us to learn as much as possible. Our youth is a gift from the Gods that must not be wasted, but used. For all of those young people in their 20's and 30's chasing after their purpose, do it with aim and with the understanding that the present is the only thing that matters because we own it. Like Marcus said, ""we can not let ourselves be concerned with which we do not have"" Cheers for this new Year, Champs!!

1,"Beginning the Journey and a New Year's Resolution I have always wanted to journal. I have made serious attempts to include journaling into my routine, however, for the most part, I have failed. When I ask myself why can't I do something so simple as journal? I realized my routine is non-existent. My New Year's Resolution is to journal, daily, with morning and evening entries that include my goals as well as all the bad things that could go wrong and prevent me from my goals. I started today, after being inspired by the Podcast: The Daily Stoic and an episode regarding Lessons on Leadership inspired by Marcus Aurelius. The lesson that is most memorable is preparedness and how Marcus Aurelius practiced and trained for 23 years before becoming an Emperor. 

My feats aren't as grand as Emperor, but I realized if I want to keep my New Year's Resolution, I must be prepared and I must practice. T-minus 12 days. 

If any of you have advice on how to keep myself accountable, I'd greatly appreciate it.

1,"I have a question: how do you value your opinion and your views on life of others. Example: Me and my brother look at this painting. I perceive the painting as good. But my brother on the other hand thinks it looks ugly. He tells me first that it’s ugly without me saying anything. I would agree to his opinion to avoid judgment. This is my problem not valuing my own opinion. 

Ever since I was a kid I was raised to believe that my opinion was always wrong and will always be wrong. So I rely on others opinions. How do I fix this i feel as though I don’t have control over my own values and end up accepting other people’s values instead of mine."

1,"I’m practicing stoicism and feeling significant emotional pain. How have you been able to integrate Stoicism? Does it reduce your pain or help you cope with it? I’ve had a challenging year and turned to Stoicism to help deal with it. When I experience negative thoughts/emotions, I try to reframe it. I just don’t feel solid or at peace. When I feel emotional pain, I try to accept it, face it, and reflect on the relevant Stoic principles. The ones I turn to most are the locus of control and evaluations of good/bad based on acting virtuously. I envision the goal to be that when emotional pain comes, you feel it, analyze it according to your principles, and move on with your day. My practice looks more like rocking back and forth, grasping onto the Stoic thoughts and praying that this will get me through. I don’t literally do that, but that’s how it feels. It’s like I’m praying for the wisdom to be analgesic. 

Much of this stems from a break up right before lockdown. I am able to get through the days effectively, it doesn’t stop me from doing anything. But I’m constantly experiencing some moderate background sadness, and every once in a while I’m brought to tears. In those moments I try to let the emotion pass through me and reframe things, but it just doesn’t feel like I’ve developed inner strength. I’ve developed the ability to cope with things without it changing my behavior which is nice, but I’m still feeling significant emotional pain. 

So what’s the realistic goal here? Does stoicism allow you to feel the pain and cope independently or does it actually reduce the pain? My issues all seem to stem from relationships, break ups, dating in general. I recently had a consultation with a therapist who specializes in relationships, loneliness, and quarter life crisis stuff(I’m 28). But I know all the wisdom needed to reduce unnecessary suffering is in Stoicism. I logically understand where my emotional pain stems from and how the source is fallacious, but I still feel inner weakness. 

Thank you."

1,"The town mouse and the country mouse I was just re-reading mediations and realised that I probably overlooked Book 11,22 the first time I read it. It reads ""The town mouse and the country mouse. Distress and the agitation of the town mouse."" 

I recently read this story to my daughter from a fairy tales compilation so I was quite surprised to see it mentioned by Marcus. A quick search revealed that this story actually originated around 600 BCE! I guess the moral is not too different from what we call the ""rat race"" today.

Fascinating to see that, as many Stoics have said, not much changes in time. Anxieties and worries today are not different from 100, 500 or even 2500 years ago."
1,"Music and Stoicism A principle of Stoicism, as far as i recall, is to be in control of ones emotions, to have power over how we react to certain situations without external stimuli. For example, when dealing with a traumatic issue, a member of the mob would act through drinking and indulging in fallacious behaviors, where on the other hand the philosopher would confide in himself as Marcus Aurelius would, or confide within a true friend as Seneca would. 
In Islam, it is widely accepted that music is not permissible as it has an affect on a persons mood and it affects their reaction towards a notion, which i have found to be true. Picture a poet reciting his poem, with music in the background, where the notes change and where the notes become intense affect the emphasis a listener would receive of a passage (go try it yourself). 
I have seen people publicly state that when they are in a bad mood or emotionally drained, they put on ‘sad’ music and because of said music they start sobbing, such is a great of example of how music negatively affects ones control over their emotions, which in my eyes seems unphilosophical. 

On the other hand, the examples i pull from, are examples from the mob, but as us aspiring philosophers, as readers, as people living in accordance to nature; though we live a similar life, our thoughts are far from alike.

If you have anything to say of such, please do share, I would love to hear your opinions on the matter!"

1,"Stoic Take On Depression(?) As I’m sure everyone is well aware this quarantine has had adverse affects on some peoples mental health. I have gotten consistent on my physical fitness, journaling, and stoic mindset and yet I fall into a cesspool of indulgence and misery every so often (every one to two months)

It never really went away. It always resides in my subconscious to some effect, sort of knowing it will come back. I am not sure how to break free of this. I do affirmations and read and apply stoic principles everyday to my best attempts. It’s not just the minor slip ups anymore, it’s a recurring problem that I see no end to.

I watch porn and just stay in bed all day when these instances occur. Anyone have any advice on how to build a habit to ensure this doesn’t happen again, or just what this is?

1,"Anti-aging research one day we may not die So I keep seeing a lot of quotes to remember our own mortality ""memeno mori"" etc.

I’m foreign in the U.S. so I really have to work extra hard for a “successful” future. Although I want to make it clear that I also don’t do anything that will stress me out too much, in other words I don’t hustle my ass off but I do hustle quite a bit. I also understand that being successful isn’t about having money or having cars but about living life being happy and content with what you’re doing. The thing is I do want to do good in school and maybe go to college so I could learn computer science and have flexible schedules and still be able to be financially stable, truth is I want time to work on music but I know that’s not something I can rely on. I’m also not too worried if college doesn’t work out since I have a ton of black up plans for the future. Anyways I’ve been rambling for a while so to put it shortly, I really spend a lot of time thinking and building towards a better future, but the stoics always say to live in the moment without worrying about the future, I’m very ambitious, is that a bad thing?"

I've been on scholarship since undergrad til grad school which i have to pay service obligation for a total of 10 years. Then I wouldnt be really able to just leave them right away. I might even just endure living with them and ignore all shit that comes out of their mouth. Sometimes I think of it as practice to hear and see nothing and just focus on my breathing.

1,"What was the main catalyst which triggered your spiritual awakening/journey? Mine was the passing of my wife after 12 years together and a long, eye-opening battle with cancer and therefore mortality. I never saw her death as an actual possibility (she was the so young, beautiful and thriving with passion and life) yet I was riddled with an intensity of fear, anxiety, and stress I cannot express in words. After her passing I quit everything and began traveling the world; volunteering, experiencing new cultures, healing, soul searching, learning, meditating, and just living life. She passed in 2014 and since then has helped guide me to a place of healing and truth... one of mindful compassion and self-love. It's just so crazy looking back upon it all... like I'm trying to recall a bedtime tale I was told as a child instead of a life I experienced and lived. Very surreal, very beautiful too.

1,"Issues with anger, and the harmful actions of others Background first, shortened because it's not all vital info nor worth fuming over as I write:

My father in-law is an ass. He's verbally assulted my sister in-law in a restaurant some time ago, and my wife more recently. Those are two incidents I know details about, but there are more. He hasn't gotten physical, but I fear that's only a matter of time (If I'm present for another such outburst, police will be called).

As for amends, he's said nothing to his daughters about the incidents. He begrudgingly attended a few therapy sessions, as we made them a requirement if he wanted to be at our wedding.

Both in-laws are visiting for New Years (yup during COVID, and yup they're putting their grand kids at risk, they don't seem to mind). They know he's not welcome at our home, and so they're staying locally with a friend of the family.

There'll be dining out, group stuff like brewery visits or something, the ball drop, and similar things that I'll be expected to attend. COVID concerns aside, I'm not sure I can be near this guy. I don't recall ever before being this angry at someone.

The topic throws my Stoic efforts to the wind, and it kind of feels like I'm loosing myself in the anger... and he's not even in town yet.

So my question is: how do Stoics deal with this? Both the external issues of such a volitile person, and the inner issues of such anger. 

I realize I can't control him, only myself, but what direction to I control myself toward? Forgiveness seems out of the question, as pretending it didn't happen is a sure fire way to let it happen again. Conversation about the issues seems pointless, as he's in denial about them... I'm at a loss."

1,"Comparison is the thief of joy: a Stoic joke. True story. I work for a semi-retired property manager, and we looked at a house for sale with a $1.6 million price tag. We think the price should be 1.2 million because several things need expensive renovations to become worth of 1.6 mil.

Just yesterday, my boss received a notice from our state government saying the property tax of the house she currently owns and lives in has increased because said government has raised the estimated value of the house is worth 1.6 mil.

My boss says ""So the government thinks my house is worth as much as that 1.6 mil fixer upper.""

1,"Today I almost cracked Today I was in a situation that made me extremely angry. The angriest I've been in awhile actually. I almost cracked and had a rage filled tantrum (screaming with lot's of cussing) in front of my colleagues. But in that moment I kept thinking of the quote ""How much more harmful are the consequences of anger and grief than the circumstances that aroused them in us!"" — Marcus Aurelius. I was not only able to delay my tantrum but avoid it all together. Obviously, I was still in a bad mood and people could tell I wasn't happy about the situation but it was reasonable for me to not be happy in this circumstance. Now I frighten myself thinking what could have happened if I had lost control of my temper."

1,"Retire into thyself Hi All,

First time post here so I hope this fits.

I've had a really tough time at work recently (haven't we all!) but I am dealing with it as best I can. Some basic Stoic practice has been incredibly helpful to me to process things. Aside from morning and evening meditations I've been reading some Marcus Aurelius and every so often I come across passages that blow me away and really stick in my mind.  One in particular is in Book 4, III:

""They seek for themselves private retiring places, as country villages, the sea-shore, mountains; yea, thou thyself art wont to long much after such places. But all this thou must know proceeds from simplicity in the highest degree. At what time soever thou wilt, it is in thy power to retire into thyself, and to be at rest, and free from all businesses."" 

Not sure why this particular one has hit home so hard but it has been a massive help for me at a time when I think we all need a break, so just wanted to share. 

Interested to know if others have had similar experiences with Stoic texts that have helped at difficult times."

1,"Most of the world is irrational? I was just thinking about this while driving on the highway the other day. I live in Florida, so the speed limit is 70 mph, but then everybody, and I mean absolutely everybody, drives at 80 mph at least. I've seen people getting pulled over so many times too, so they do enforce the law here...It's just that people keep breaking the law lol...Sometimes I even get honked at for ""driving too slow"" as I always drive at 70 mph (like a good citizen).

What got me thinking is that how much time it actually saves by breaking the law and risking getting a ticket. 

Assuming if your workplace is 70 miles away (which is unrealistic, but let's go with it for convenience of calculation), then it takes you an hour to get there if you obey the law and drive at 70 mph. If you break the law and drive at 80 mph though, it takes you 0.875 hours to get to work. That's 52 minutes and 30 seconds. So in essence, you would've saved only 7 minutes and 30 seconds if you break the law. But if your workplace is 35 miles away (which is appropriate for most people), you save even less time. In fact, you save only 3 minutes and 45 seconds. Rationally, it's never worth it, but most people just do it anyway...every single day...It just makes me wonder."

1,"To the mountains of your mind? &gt;People try to get away from it all -- to the country, to the beach, to the mountains. Which is idiotic: you can get away from it anytime you like. By going within. - Marcus Aurelius. Meditations 4:3

I struggle with being happy when I am not in nature. I am often discontented and wishing to be physically located somewhere I am not, ie the mountains or the forest, so this quote inspires me to look inward and be content where I am. Does anyone else struggle with not feeling fully alive when absent from the outdoors? And does Stoic philosophy help you with that struggle?

Credit to u/Kromulent for helping me find the source in its context:

Looks like Meditations 4:3. Here's a different translation, and the full context:

&gt;Men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the country, seashores,  and mountains; and thou too art wont to desire such things very much.  But this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men, for it is  in thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself. For  nowhere either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble does a man  retire than into his own soul, particularly when he has within him such  thoughts that by looking into them he is immediately in perfect  tranquillity; and I affirm that tranquillity is nothing else than the  good ordering of the mind. Constantly then give to thyself this retreat,  and renew thyself; and let thy principles be brief and fundamental,  which, as soon as thou shalt recur to them, will be sufficient to  cleanse the soul completely, and to send thee back free from all  discontent with the things to which thou returnest. For with what art  thou discontented? With the badness of men? Recall to thy mind this  conclusion, that rational animals exist for one another, and that to  endure is a part of justice, and that men do wrong involuntarily; and  consider how many already, after mutual enmity, suspicion, hatred, and  fighting, have been stretched dead, reduced to ashes; and be quiet at  last.—But perhaps thou art dissatisfied with that which is assigned to  thee out of the universe.—Recall to thy recollection this alternative;  either there is providence or atoms \[fortuitous concurrence of things\];  or remember the arguments by which it has been proved that the world is a  kind of political community \[and be quiet at last\].—But perhaps  corporeal things will still fasten upon thee.—Consider then further that  the mind mingles not with the breath, whether moving gently or  violently, when it has once drawn itself apart and discovered its own  power, and think also of all that thou hast heard and assented to about  pain and pleasure \[and be quiet at last\].—But perhaps the desire of the  thing called fame will torment thee.—See how soon everything is  forgotten, and look at the chaos of infinite time on each side of \[the  present\], and the emptiness of applause, and the changeableness and want  of judgment in those who pretend to give praise, and the narrowness of  the space within which it is circumscribed \[and be quiet at last\]. For  the whole earth is a point, and how small a nook in it is this thy  dwelling, and how few are there in it, and what kind of people are they  who will praise thee."

1,"How to deal with things that constantly hurt me mentally but are completely out of my control? Yeah, yeah. Countless posts like this. But my problem is this.

How do I deal with the mental pain that I constantly receive from thinking about all the societal problems (about which I won't go into detail unless necessary) over which I have little to no control?

It mostly annoys me because of how powerless I feel over it and that it may negatively impact people I care about, even complete strangers I don't know.

I know spending time and energy on pondering issues I have no control over is one of the things stoicism is against, but being completely passive about it sounds like a horrible alternative to me"

1,"Dichotomy of Control as a Defense Mechanism (state of the sub) **Let me preface before I continue:** I understand that there are different facets, a multitude of nuances that can be debated over and considered in vs. out of our direct control, and many of these situations are conditional, sometimes subjective, however this is not the discussion I want to make today.

After seeing multiple posts and discussions about the direction r/Stoicism is heading and the subsequent *“it’s out of your control, bro; but you’re getting worked up about it, so that’s not very Stoic of you”* comments on those threads, it seems that the Dichotomy of Control model that many love to drool over is becoming a tool to encourage a passive mindset, and worse: a defense mechanism toward a discussion that they disagree or are not comfortable with.

There is even a flavor of gatekeeping, implying that advocating for any sort of change to improve the quality of the subreddit makes you less of a Stoic—a person give in to their reactions—than those who adhere to the black-and-white definition of the dichotomy of control.

As is mentioned multiple times by many, Stoics are not passive. r/Stoicism was created as a space to encourage discussion and growth of ideas—but if those ideas stray too far from what is generally considered Stoic it is our duty to gently steer the conversation back on track. 

Sure, one *does* have the option to let it be, but you are allowing the other to foster their inaccuracies and in turn help spread it. It is one thing to have educated them about their mistakes and yet they stubbornly hold on to their misconstrued idea despite all you’ve done, and another to simply let them go because you can’t be bothered.

One is accepting the consequences of your action, the other is passivity.

When others call out something another redditor proposes to improve this sub as “it’s out of your control, you can choose to ignore it” that is perpetuating this half-baked practice of the dichotomy of control. 

When you've exhausted all viable options to help improve a situation, and yet the result is the same, *that* is out of your control and when you accept Fate.

I leave the stage open to you all."

1,"Requested Action by Moderators Hi, r/stoicism.  After reading [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/kfhqqs/this_subreddits_low_effort_content_which/) by u/sqaz2wsx, I got to thinking that there are two really easy things the mods can do to improve the quality of the subreddit for those of us who like more substantive discussion about the philosophy than we do about some of the other posts.

1. **Require a flair for all posts.**  This is super easy.  The steps are as simple as Mod tools =&gt; Post requirements =&gt; Post flair.  Once that's done, Stoics on the subreddit can filter out posts based on flairs.
2. **Add ""Humor"" and ""Advice"" flairs.**  Also super easy to do.  Nobody said jokes aren't allowed on the subreddit, but it's up to the mods to determine a quality joke from a meme or low-effort joke.  For those of us who are more sticks in the mud than the mods, we could then filter out all ""Humor"" from the subreddit!  Same goes for the advice posts.  If some Stoics here feel inundated by the advice posts, this gives them the power to turn the spigot, so to speak.

Figured that rather than demanding you do something, I would just offer you mods some specific things you can do so users can curate their own experience here."

1,Somebody very dear to me shared this thought with me today. 
1,"I got a salary raise today Today I had my salary revision, and my boss gave me a quite high raise, much higher than he needs to in my opinion.

Off course, this is undoubtly a positive thing, and I should be glad. But in an attempt to train my stoic thinking I tried to not care.*
My thinking here was that I should not care about my salary. If I’m very happy for a raise, I will be equally unhappy the day I don’t make this much.

What do you think about this? Is this rational and a good stoic approach to getting a salary raise?


*I was grateful and polite to my boss, thanking him."
1,"Trouble remaining stoic due to work stress. Alright.  So I am pretty good at my job.  I'm a night supervisor in a large warehouse in a production factory.  Tonight, I had to leave retrieve a form for an employee from my managers office.  I have a key.  While I was in there I saw a sticky note that said ""Write up (me) and (my immediate boss)"".  I was not snooping.  I saw my name.  I have no idea why I am going to be written up.  I have been off for a couple of days.  I can think of nothing that would cause this.  My manager said nothing to me while he was here.

Anyways, he's a good guy.  I'm sure I actually messed up.  He's not a bad manager by any means and I am trying to view this as a learning experience.  In the meantime my anxiety is through the roof because of past bosses. What do I need to do to get through today?"
1,i hate this conception of stoicism 
1,"Ryan Holiday - Scam? I am facing some challenges in real life and was wondering if stoicism could help.

So I started following this domain of philosophy and came across Ryan Holiday's new year challenge.

1. Can anyone rationally explain to me how is it worth 100$?
2. I think the stoicism branch of philosophy has a calming essence in it where you are not as attached to external things such as money. This is my opinion. I have not studied stoicism but after reading some Epictetus there is that essence that is non-materialistic to me. Why is Ryan Holiday, a student of stoicism so attached to money? Am I wrong here?

There can be a case made for stoicism having zero ounces of relation with wealth and I will happily accept my mistakes."
1,"This subreddits low effort content which misrepresents Stoicism has turned into the rule, not the exception I have been meaning to make this post for a while but i think its time now after seeing [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/kexwyk/above_it_all/) post. As a long time contributor to this subreddit for the most part i don't browse this subreddit anymore because frankly the quality of this subreddit is extremely poor. The current state of this subreddit content is a parody of Stoicism, low effort posts that resembles bad and blatantly misleading representations of Stoicism that flies in the face of the quality and complexity of the Stoic philosophy displayed in the texts of the big three and the values of hardwork and dedication showed by them. 

The post above is a perfect example of what i am talking about, a low effort completely misleading representation of Stoicism should not be on the top of this subreddit. The fact is that the lack of quality control in this subreddit does not reflect ancient or modern Stoicism but misrepresentations, bad takes are the rule of this subreddit not the exception. Stoicism isn't about being unaffected or above it all like it is represented in that post, but correctly applying wisdom, justice, courage and temperance to every aspect of our lives but this is very rarely discussed in this subreddit. 

The solution is simple, mods need to enforce their own rules which they constantly neglect by letting offending posts slide, and make rules to remove these low effort image posts or turn this subreddit back into text only. The mod team, i believe in this subreddit the mod team is far far too small to do anything, subreddits with 360k subs have vastly larger mod team. Not only is it small but i feel like the mods want to make the subreddit immediately accessible and agreeable to every new comer. This policy might have accelerated growth but it has lost its Stoic flavour in the process. I joined this sub when it had 30k subs and it is a dramatically different sub then it is today. I would like to hear the mods and the subreddits in general thoughts on this."

1,"Is being hopeful a Stoic trait? I have been reading a book lately about hope and it's portrayed in a negative way for the fact that being hopeful of positive change in the future means you have not completely accepted the present.

Unless I'm being completely ignorant of something here I can't see how being hopeful, wanting something better in the future is good for a Stoic approach to life. Cheers"
1,"Stoic Quotes Aren't Really Helping You... I may sound as an ""orthodox reader"" but, as someone who spent over 10 years studying Philosophy, I'm very concerned about so many people reducing it all to isolated quotes that are not only taken out of the broader context, but also misinterpreted through the same ideological veil that, ironically, is precisely what Philosophy should help you overcome.

This is specially true with Stoicism (it got really popular in 2020) and it's frightening to see how most of the online content about it has become extremely shallow and commoditized. It all functions as a mere palliative tool for psychological relief, overshadowing the whole majesty of this discipline.

Anyway, I made a video [explaining in more detail](https://youtu.be/BpG2f_BNZrU) the whole issue. Maybe I'm just overreacting, I don't know, that's why I'd like to hear what others think."
1,"It’s about girl she is in my head. A girls from more than 1 year is talking with me and we went out like 10-13 times. She has boyfriend and she used to come out with me. 
After lockdown we talked a lot on msg and.  I got feelings for her I told her she said  everything was between us was friendly.  And we can talk further as friend. 
But I cut  most of the communication with her since she I knew I was addicted to her.  So to stop  this I cut communication with her. 
But  since we don’t talk she is like 13 hrs in my head and I can’t stop thinking. I remember Marcus statement chose not to harm and u wont then I get back for like 15-20 min then again she is on my mind. 
And I told her if we want to get out again u are the one asking me out I am not coz all the time I did.  
And since she is not asking me out it’s also bothering me.  
I remember that it’s her actions are not controllable. Then I get back for 15-20 min and then again same. 
P.S. - I told her nothing about this but it’s playing with my head.

1,"(Poll) What is the Myers-Briggs personality type of r/Stoicism's members? Just a curious little thought that I had. 

I'm aware that Myers-Briggs personality tests are far from being a good assessment of an individual's personality, but they can give a kind of broad, low resolution idea of an individual's tendencies and thought patterns. I personally always turn out as the same personality type no matter how many times I take it, but I know the lines can be blurred for others due to its unscientific nature.

If you also know where you stand on the Big Five personality traits, feel free to share your data if you wish to. 

I'm an INTJ. My personal guess before any results come in is that Stoicism probably attracts the ""intuitive thinking"" (NT) types more so than others, but we'll see what comes from the results of this poll. 

... Aaaand I should have Googled this subject *before* writing this thread and poll /facepalm. Though to be fair, none of the threads that have already been made on this subject seem to have a poll attached to them, so I guess that's a first. Might as well submit for fresh new data."

1,"How do you deal with people you rather not be around ? If i decide i do not want to talk to someone , (a friend or family member) i feel that means i have some animosity towards the person and thats not very stoic. Ever since i been studying stoicism I’ve gotten a lot of moments like this where i fully understand who a person is , how they act and think and I realize i don’t want to be around this. I don’t act malicious towards them in any way , ill even have a genuine laugh here and there but i rather not be around them. I’ve been more in touch with my feelings without showing it and somehow thats helped me understand people in general more , seeing people for who they are good or bad. 

I know Marcus talks about meeting these people and having to deal with them everyday but do i have to ? If so how do i ?"
1,"I just had a breakup... and I feel fine! Only now do I realize the dramatic impact just beginning to get into Stoicism has had on me. Instead of giving in and wallowing in perceived loss, I realized that I didn't have control over the circumstances or events outside of myself (the long distance was the problem) or any person except myself. 

I realized that I could accept and acknowledge the feelings that were present, but that I should also remember that I only have control over one thing: my reaction to these events. I determined that take what I could learn from it instead of regressing in character, and that I'd forgive and empathize with my former partner; this is the respect we issue to other rational beings and aligns with the virtue of justice.

Furthermore, I can appreciate that we had enjoyable times. Everything is temporary, thus we can acknowledge when we are allowed to indulge in moderation while also realizing that nothing will remain forever. 

As a result, I feel far better than I think I would have if I hadn't gained this perspective. I didn't mean to make a big point and I'm new so you can point out something if you find it flawed, but I just wanted to remind you of the effect even a bit of Stoic teaching can have on the uninitiated."
1,"Stoic approach to dealing with passing up on your big break? A few months ago I was offered my dream job in my dream field. It likely would have been the perfect stepping stone to further, more advanced work in my desired field too. The only problem was that it required moving away from where I currently live and grew up to a small town in the middle of nowhere. It therefore would have required leaving my friends and family (who I had just reconnected with after 3 pretty miserable years at uni) and living on my own in a strange new place in the middle of a pandemic where opportunities to make new connections and build up a support network are limited.

While recognised how fortunate I was to have been offered a job given the current condition of the world, I ultimately decided that the costs outweighed the benefits and turned down the job, opting to take up a place in the reserve pool where candidates could be offered other upcoming vacancies. At the time I convinced myself I was acting virtuously because I wasn’t abandoning my personal relationships and roles (I tutor local students and look after my young brothers) for the sake of career progression and financial gain, but I fear I’ve both mislead myself and made a massive mistake.

Not only have I failed to find any long term work in my local area, but the offer of a job through the reserve pool has been non-existent. Furthermore, as I have continued my studies of stoic theory I’m beginning to suspect I based my decision on vice, not virtue. These quotes from Book 2 of Epictetus’ Discourses were particularly impactful:

&gt;\[27\] Every day you should put the ideas in action that protect against attachment to externals such as individual people, places or institutions – even your own body.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[29\] After all, what difference does it make what a person is enslaved to, and cannot live without? You’re no different from a teenager mooning over a girl when you ache for your familiar haunts, your club, your old gang of friends and former way of life.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[30\] Here is someone distraught because he will no longer drink of the water of Dirce. Is our water here in Rome inferior somehow?  
&gt;  
&gt;‘No, but I had grown used to Dirce’s.’  
&gt;  
&gt;\[31\] Well, you will get used to ours in time. And once you become used to it, the day may come when you pine for it in turn.  
&gt;  
&gt;\[35\] How can you associate yourself with Socrates, who lived and died as he did, or with Diogenes? \[36\] You cannot imagine either of them reduced to tears or tantrums because they weren’t going to see this man, or that woman, or because they had to be in Susa, say, or Ecbatana, rather than Athens or Corinth.

In these quotes I can see that my decision not to move may have been based on attachments to my family and friends, and that, as a result, my decision was based in vice. As a result I’ve missed out on a huge opportunity and I have no current prospects.   


How would a stoic approach this situation I find myself in? How would they handle the anxiety and regret I feel? I’m still quite new to all this and I would appreciate any guidance anyone could give. Thanks."
1,Comparison is the thief of joy 
1,"I lost control - What should I take away from this experience? I never fight. It is difficult to make me angry. I behave logically all the time. I'm calm and collected. I practice stoicism every day. These are all things I tell myself which aren't strictly true.

The practice didn't count for anything this week at work. I was short with one co-worker. I was blaming my colleagues actions for my frustrations. My heart was racing. I was in a rush to get somewhere. Fumbling around trying to plug in a laptop charger felt as stressful as open heart surgery. I reacted to not being able to connect to a printer like someone had just stolen my car. For the first time I snapped at my other co-worker. I found despite consciously being aware of my state that I couldn't control my behaviour.

He said ""you seem stressed"". I thought, and replied that I was, and probably need time to cool off. By the afternoon, I was calm and apologised for my actions. I don't remember experiencing anything like this in my adult life.

Trying to pin down the reasons:

- I'd had less sleep than normal.

- I'd taken a caffiene pill and had a coffee. 

- I went into the office, for perhaps the 5th time in 10 months - In fact between that and the supermarket that's been it so despite speaking to others on games and over the phone I'd probably become unsocialised.

- On the way to work, I was having intrusive thoughts and emotions linked to some transgressions years prior.

Now I'm wondering whether I'm not practicing stoicism well enough, or at least wondering what I could do differently. I was aware of my state. I wanted to behave better at the time. And yet it didn't change my state, and I was barely in control of my own thoughts nor my own behaviour."

1,4 Powerful Stoic Quotes on Strength 
1,"Stoic advice needed on alcoholic parental figure. Anonymous issue:

I am a 20-year-old university student and for the holidays i return to my family home with my mother, stepfather, younger brother and dog. I also have my father and grandparents in the area. I love my family; they have supported my endeavours and have always done their best to take care of me. But it isn’t as smooth sailing as people may see from the outside. I prefer to stay at my mother’s house, because after the divorce that is how the court case fell. My father was a very intimidating figure in my life, particularly when my brother and I were younger and, although our relationship has improved, i feel as though i will always be wary and slightly uncomfortable around him. My mother on the other hand, is an alcoholic and causes great upset when she does drink, which is often. In particular, she aims her antisocial behaviours towards myself and my stepfather (should i not be there); my brother tends to witness it all. She denies a problem, often ignoring everyone whilst the hangover wears off and should I go to confront her about her drunken words and/or actions, this results in further aggression and upset. Over the years I have reached out to her parents, siblings, husband, friends and as much as I push nothing changes. It hurts me to come home to this and it has gotten to the point where thoughts of it being my fault won’t pass. I want to make it better but i feel as though it is out of my control, and it is very draining. The dynamic upsets my brother even though he would never admit to it and i am very worried about his mental health. i don’t know what to do, who to turn to, i feel very helpless. I feel as though if I attempt to change this I will be cut out from this family; something I do not want. What would a stoic do in this situation? Any help is appreciated."

""Dokkodo"" was largely composed on the occasion of Musashi giving away his possessions in preparation for death, and was dedicated to his favorite disciple, Terao Magonojō (to whom the earlier Go rin no sho [The Book of Five Rings] had also been dedicated), who took them to heart.

1,"Advice regarding involuntary expressiveness What's up, Stoic circle?  Got a topic for discussion.  I've really gotten the hang of not allowing dispreferred events to bother me long-term.  It's helped stop me from developing/holding grudges, reduced my overall anxiety about uncertainty, etc.  However, it seems that I still have an immediate outward response to something, even if I rationally expected it to occur.  You might call it an outburst.  For instance, let's say I'm playing a sport and miss a point.  I will outwardly react in a frustrated manner, but almost immediately after that initial reaction, I'm good to go.  No lasting regret or disappointment or distress.  But I want to make it so those involuntary reactions are less frequent or expressive.

I get that we as Stoics are not supposed to be unemotive or literally stone-faced.  That emotions and expressing them is healthy.  But I also recognize that allowing proto-emotions to trigger an outward reaction before I have a chance to rationally observe them is problematic and can lead to false impressions about me.

I've started to just do a little CBT if that's the right word.  If I have an outburst, I just mentally catch myself, make a note of it, and tell myself that ""expression is fine, reaction is not,"" but I'm still working on it.  Anyone have any techniques for lengthening the gap between proto emotions and outward response?"

1,"Using an ungifted gift as a reminder of impermanence About 5 months ago, I was in a great spot. I was working out, had a relationship ""lined up"" (and yes, I am at fault for thinking it was 100% going to work out). This was a girl that made me happy no matter what else was happening in my life. She was great to me and I felt comforted just seeing her. 

I decided to get her a gift for our first official date; a nice blue and silver necklace. It's cheap and from Amazon but she didn't have to know that. However, our relationship took for a turn after we both made some mistakes. A lot of fights, me being emotionally hurt (due to my expectations and desires). A lot of self-development, but you're not here for that.

I tried getting rid of the necklace a few times by asking friends if they wanted it but they rejected for one reason or another. Now it sits on my desk by my copy of The Discourses of Epictetus as a reminder to not have false expectations. I wonder if anyone else has something similar and wants to share their story."
1,"Seeking advice on framing, dealing with anxious thoughts as I deal with consequences of mistakes made that I cannot take back I am seeking some advice on how to be stoic in my current situation, as I feel as though I am spiraling. My family has recently dealt with our fair share of stressful events, noting that we're very new to the practice of stoicism and I am especially not very good at parsing what I can control, what I cannot. I suffer from anxiety disorder, and have only recently begun to address it through therapy. We lost our pet cat suddenly to heart disease 2 weeks ago. We are in the process of buying a home, and the bank has given us the run around on this, despite having good incomes and great debt to income ratios. We have had to compensate for the ineptitude of those we work with, and the inefficiency of the capitalist system. But I've had a good perspective throughout the whole process, understanding that there's a pandemic raging, and that the process of home buying can become stressful and expensive, not entirely because of what we did. I'm in the process of switching jobs AFTER the home closes. For my new job, I had to apply for a corporate credit card. Without thinking about it I applied, only to realize that there is the potential of a hard inquiry on my credit report which may affect my ability to close. Of course, I reached out to them to stop processing it a little too late, and the credit card company already received the request. But since then I've been able to get a hold of some support staff who advised as to some possible next steps to ensure the cc application does get canceled. We close by the end of the year, and at this point I don't know what will happen. William B Irvine's lesson on framing really is helping me some, because I am worrying about the outcome of something hurting me that has not yet happened. As it stands, the cc application has not yet gone through, the bank has not yet asked questions, and nothing has happened. But I have not been able to deal with this very well. I am looking for advice."

1,"Negative motivation vs Positive motivation? I used to be motivated by negative things - desires for fame and fortune, desires for revenge, to prove people right, these types of things. Through Stoicism over time, I've let these things go, and am happier for it. The problem is is that I'm almost completely unmotivated, and can't find any justification to be motivated. I am pretty happy with life overall. I really wish I had that burning drive and motivation to accomplish big things, but I can't find any positive ways to justify it and fuel it.    
    
Is there any fix to this? Is there a way to justify a kind of Nietzschean will to power, to have the drive of Julius Ceasar or Sulla or Elon Musk or John Carmack alongside Stoicism? To want to try and conquer the world or accomplish as much as possible to prove to yourself you can do it, while also being content and level headed about life?"

1,"I was in a car crash today On the way home from work today I was in a 4 car crash. Airbags went off, car is totalled and I was extremely lucky to walk away with barely a scratch on me.

I'm only 30, recently married, no kids yet and have always held a view of death with a kind of indifference. The only loss I have experienced in these 30 years is that of pets and an estranged grandmother who died when I was in my mid 20's who I had no contact with since I was around 6. I think this had lead to my indifference (might not be the best word) towards death. Obviously I have been very upset when my pets have died but it's something that you deal with and move on.

Anyway, after the crash today I was fine, got out of the car and checked on all the other drivers involved and during the whole experience I barely felt my heart rate increase to the point in which I noticed that was the case. I was calm.

I have had a bit of emergency training in the past which I believe helped but it is still weird to look back at how calm I was at the time.

It's been a little over 5 hours since the crash now and I think for the first proper time in my life, I am afraid of death. I am afraid of the things I could miss. I am afraid of not having kids. I am afraid of not being able to support my parents. I am afraid of not growing old with my wife. 

You see stories of people everyday who die in an instant from some kind of freak accident and part of your brain always disassociates that from yourself. Today I was reminded that anyone could die at any moment and to make sure you make the most of your time because you will never know if you have 1 day left or 10000.

Carpe diem
Memento mori"
1,"Long-term solutions. Lately, I'm thinking a lot about long-term solutions. I don't think they exist. Even Stoicism isn't or shouldn't be considered that way. Whenever you start doing something because you think it affects your life in the long-term, you're making assumptions about a future that is not in your control. 

Let's look at an example. Say you want to implement some kind of practice in your life, learning an instrument, workout, whatever. You have a goal in mind, an outcome that you get when you do it long enough. But after a while, you stop. You think you don't get the merit out of it as you should. 

You stopped because you thought about it as a long-term investment. As soon as you get impatient, you only see the negative parts, the effort it takes just to keep going. It starts to be a battle of willpower. Maybe you are strong enough to achieve what you planned, but more often you will stop because it doesn't seem worth the effort anymore.

But what happens, if we change the only thing, we all truly are able to. Our mindset. If we think about something only in short-terms, we get a completely different view. We start because it seems to affects us positively. If it doesn't, we stop, but if it does we do it again tomorrow. And the day after. It doesn't become tedious, because each day we see the positive outcome. And almost effortless we achieve things others would think be impossible without the daily struggle.

And I think it works universally. A while ago, I read a post about that people often search for short-term solutions on this subreddit and that Stoicism works only when you embrace it and make it a lifestyle. I dwelled on it for quite a while. Who decides how long it takes to make something a lifestyle. To me, it sounds again like an assumption about the future. ""If I commit long enough to Stoicism, I will..."". To some point it's true, you won't get anything out of it if you do it once. But that's the case for everything. A single therapy session won't solve your problems either. But only if you see some kind of results, you will keep going.

I don't write my thoughts down in my journal, so I may feel better in a week. I write them down to reflect on right now. I meditate, not to get better over the next year, but because it calms me now and lets me observe my mental state.

I don't think there are long-term solutions. Only short-term solutions, that proved to be successful. Only in retrospection, one can see the long-term effect. That's why it's good to keep track of once progress, so the improvement gets visible.

So, if you lay on your deathbed, reflecting on your life, and say Stoicism was your long-term solution, I might not disagree.

Sorry, that was quite a long shower.

I'm even having hallucinations about that guy, I'm not in a good situation but still I'm trying to stay positive as I'll die one day, see i can even make a joke about it. Then why do you all hate me?

1,"What are your thoughts and opinions on this? Hello, was curious about this community’s opinion...

I think at least we can change things by changing ourselves, that is, by finding our own self, or, by accepting some aspects and correcting some of them. In fact, we can inspire the lives of others, even when we think we are creating awareness in our own lives. But first we need to focus on our selves.

I also think that information that is hardly used at all won't do me much good. But, the information I can use in my life is useful. I am not a person living with the past, but, I can say that I have a concern for the future. I will do my best to overcome these concerns, because it makes it difficult for me to focus on other jobs. When I experience bad events, the events that I have mentioned as a reason for them, such as the death of a loved one, I tell myself that it is bad because I think badly, and that scene I call bad reflects as a positive thought and a good memory. Our reaction to these events related to how we see and name things.

But, sometimes, thinking pessimistically becomes my feeding point. Experiencing an event that saddens me makes me write better. Maybe, it's because I think sadness makes me write better. But, sometimes‚ I just keep an eye on a flying bee, and travel the world with it."

Fortune favors the bold, but it is not without training and testing us first.

1,"Confused about nature passage Don't completely understand what he's getting at in this passage.

“Nature of any kind thrives on forward progress. And progress for a rational mind means not accepting falsehood or uncertainty in its perceptions, making unselfish actions its only aim, seeking and shunning only the things it has control over, embracing what nature demands of it—the nature in which it participates, as the leaf’s nature does in the tree’s. Except that the nature shared by the leaf is without consciousness or reason, and subject to impediments. Whereas that shared by human beings is without impediments, and rational, and just, since it allots to each and every thing an equal and proportionate share of time, being, purpose, action, chance. Examine it closely. Not whether they’re identical point by point, but in the aggregate: this weighed against that.”

1,"How Stoicism helped me to see my addiction A couple of days ago I decided to make a drastic change, It might not be so drastic for you guys but this was my escape from reality. This was the thing that was keeping all my demons away from me. I deleted every single game from my computer, something I knew I should have done a while ago but always said to myself that it's too dramatic. These were internal excuses I was making up in my head to protect myself from reality. So I finally decided to pull the trigger.

Deep down I think all of us know what we should be doing, and when we don't do that certain thing it slowly starts eating us from within. It starts killing our confidence since we realize we can't even take control of the only things within our control. I moved to America 2 years ago and a lot of my ideas did not go to plan, so I used video games to escape reality. Seeing beautifully designed worlds, unlocking new achievements, learning new skills all made me stop thinking of all the real issues I was experiencing in real life and it gave me this false illusion of accomplishing something.

You can't outrun your personal issues until you confront them internally. You have to fight a battle no one can fight for you. When you use outlets like games, drugs, alcohol, your partner, and social circle to make you feel better it's always temporary. It's crucial you don't bullshit yourself... look at things in the face and know them for what they are. Every night when I went to sleep a swarm of thoughts came to my mind knowing I lied to myself and withheld myself from taking action on my dreams. I feared trying because I have failed in the past before, I feared trying because I would be accountable for something important. But I trusted my gut this time and pulled the trigger.

My OCD kicked in after I deleted everything, this time there was nowhere to escape. For the next couple of days, I lived in my head, all sorts of negative, disgusting, and miserable thoughts swarmed my mind. I lost touch with reality since I was so stuck trying to deal with not thinking. But I used this extremely fucked up situation to better myself, to actually confront it. I felt the pain of being lost, I felt so fucking lost.. not knowing what the next step in my life will be... acknowledging how much time I have lost and how much I have lied to myself. The saddest part is not taking account of actions you are 100% capable of.

But I feel empowered by taking this step in my life. I feel empowered by dealing with my issues instead of running away from them. Every day I start my day with some physical activities and meditation which has been helping me out a lot. I'm not going to lie, I'm still figuring things out. I'm still deciding what my next steps in my career will be, how I will be getting there, and so on. I know this is a healthy step for my future and dealing with everything I hid from myself. But please do yourself a favor and call yourself out on your bullshit, do the things you know you should be doing, and don't give in to that inner bitch! You know exactly what bullshit I'm referring to.

    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings

1,"I used to be a stoic (in a sense) without realizing Recently I’ve been going through tough times that have switched my thinking completely. It sprouted from cumulative loss and lots of grieving, along with a second wave of the pandemic we’re in. My mind just starting expecting the worst constantly, I’m always worried that some sort of catastrophe is imminent, and that i’m gonna experience lots of loss in short time. My minds way of coping has caused me to think in an extremely nihilistic way. It doesn’t help- I’m constantly thinking the worst will happen and at the same time my mind is yelling “it doesn’t matter what happens, nothing matters, it will amount to nothing, nothing you do or anyone does matters, bad things will happen and you will feel scared and you can’t change it”. 
Every piece of “bad news” I hear bothers me. I’m sensitive to everything. I can’t enjoy anything I do anymore because of these thoughts. I’ve entirely lost my sense of self.
I look back at myself earlier in the year and before this switch in my mind came to be. Maybe i wasn’t necessarily a stoic but my way of thinking matched up more. Nothing bothered me. I enjoyed literally every minute of everyday no matter what I was doing, I was happy to just simply be living. I was always up to do anything and I could find a way to enjoy every single second of every situation. When the pandemic came around and people were complaining about a “new normal” and how scary it is, I told them I didn’t mind it, and I even enjoyed the little changes to my life. I told them hey, we’re still living, the world is still turning, I can get used to any change that happens, as long as I still have my life. Any devestating news I heard was just news. I listened, and then went about the rest of my day that I had to enjoy. I remember hearing something about the world ending within a week at some point and I just completely forgot about it, cause, I had my day to go on about and plans I was looking forward to. If I heard one of those stupid doomsday threats now I would be curled up in a ball until the date came and passed. 
My question is, what can I do to get my way of thought back (perhaps in even more depth than I had before) ? Also, has anyone else experienced this? It’s like I’m restarting from a different mindset. I want my old mindset back so badly. Maybe this post may look unnecessary to everyone on here and my question may already have answers if I dig.

I went to cook breakfast for her, but she declined and then we both kept getting into each other's way in the kitchen with a few short tempered words. I successfully converted this source of negative energy into positive energy by focusing on cleaning all the countertops in the kitchen, thus creating sufficient work spaces for two people to work separately. (She was responsible for most of the mess, but that's not really my place to dwell now that the problem has been solved.)

I got some coffee ready, but something went wrong with the machine and then she had to take a video call at the shared apartment, so I left without trying to fix the machine or drinking my coffee.

I'm at my lone apartment now, having boiled some water for the coffee... only to find that my coffee mug cannot be found.

The coffee mug that is arguably the only piece of my personal possession in this entire empty anonymous apartment.

This is, humorously, the most offensive violation of logic I've had to deal with today. Ever since elementary school science, they've been telling me ""Matter cannot be created or destroyed, only converted"" - so where's my coffee mug?

1,"Scholarship for a University I applied for first year students   Essay prompt-  **Describe an intellectual idea that has transformed your thinking.** (I decided to write about Stoicism as my essay answer, please give me constructive criticism. 

The ability to maintain equanimity in an ever-changing world is a powerful skill. It effectively recalibrates and strengthens one’s mind. This is the primary foundation of stoicism, a timeless Roman philosophy, which transformed my thinking. Stoicism was founded by Zeno of Citium in 300 B.C.E and has encountered an immense following from the 3rd century to the present day. Due to other famous philosophers such as Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius leaving detailed journals on stoicism combined with practices that many individuals embodied; the philosophy continues to grow. Stoic exercises include an abundance of mindset shifts and daily phrases which have fostered my growth.

I first encountered stoicism during the initial quarantine (April 2020). It was an extremely stressful time in which my reality was completely altered. Consequently, I became heavily unmotivated and lackadaisical due to forces outside of my control. Initially, remote learning presented itself as a hindrance to my scholastic progress. I completed school assignments but found myself clueless about the direction my learning should take because I was accustomed to classroom instruction. However, this changed once I read “Meditations” by Marcus Aurelius.

In his journal, I discovered emperor Aurelius’ daily thinking which attributed to his mental toughness. He goes into full detail about his accomplishments and failures at the end of each day. By becoming dismissive towards things outside of his control, he expounds that failure is not negative but a new opportunity for success. Immediately, I was given a new perspective on my lack of motivation towards remote learning. I then used this new learning experience as an opportunity to improve as a student.

Merriam-Webster defines the stoic phrase memento mori as a reminder of mortality. Every day I strive to embody this stoic principle. Aurelius professes that one could die at any second and this fact should govern an individual’s mannerisms. I was intrigued by such a concept and my viewpoint on time began to shift. I realized it imperative to make constructive use of each second because the next one may not be guaranteed. Having integrated memento mori into all phases of my learning my studying habits and time management skill have greatly improved. In retrospect, remote learning created more time to fully devote myself to studies and career aspirations.

Through stoicism, I also discovered amor fati. The English translation of this Latin phrase is an embracement of one’s fate. Whenever I encounter situations outside of my control, I remain neutral and decide to love my destiny. In doing so, I do not become a conduit for negativity and make myself available for positivity. Subsequently, in learning to love myself I have become more accepting of others.

1,"What opinions/advice do you have for me? It’d be nice to be a virtuous person. But, I don’t want to spend my life being a virtuous person. I mean, I don’t want to waste my time just for being virtuous. But at least I want to get to know stoicism. I looked up Martha Nussbaum on google, and I think I have to read her books. You know what they say: If you are a virtuous person, you will have a good life, you will find a place in your social life, and gain originality in terms of psychology.

Allow me to clarify: I don’t think being virtuous is a waste of time. I would misrepresent myself if I said it is. But, trying to be virtuous in this age is difficult. Because, I tried very hard to be humble and approach people in a forgiving attitude, this experiment failed. In my opinion, stoic philosophy is interesting and useful. To clarify further: I am not against stoic philosophy, I just wanted to say the difficulty of trying to be virtuous, at least in this century.

I’m sure what Marcus went through was very difficult at that time. But first, I have to meet my own needs. In other words, there is unemployment and economic crisis, especially in our country. It is difficult to think about this because of financial difficulties. And I don't want to put myself in a mold right now. But, I value people's opinions, so I read the philosophies of thinkers. Fortunately, there are philosophers, and fortunately, there are free brains to think differently.

And of course, anything is possible if you want and work for it. Perhaps the excuse that I mentioned is the moment. But, as I’m telling you, it's hard for me to focus on this situation right now. So, I will try to read and understand them. Maybe I will decide on this path in the future and walk."

What was the purpose that we live with virtue (according to nature) if nothing matters? I know they say that virtue is all that matters, but the question is: why? Thank you so much!"

1,"Stoicism for a Better Life – Weekly exercise (December 13, 2020) Hello there,

With the holiday seasons around the corner, I will keep the topic pertinent to the season. And since I recently re-read some of Seneca’s work as a refresher and reminder, I’ll stick with his words of wisdom to inspire us this week. Here’s a gem from his letters to Lucilius, XVIII:

&gt;“…a man gives himself the surest proof of his steadfastness if he neither goes nor allows himself to be led to the agreeable pastimes which involve self-indulgence. It shows more austerity to stay dry and sober when the crowd is puking drunk, but more control not to make oneself an exception, not to be markedly different nor yet one of the crowd, but to do as others do, only not in the same way. It is possible to observe a holiday without self-indulgence.”

Half of this quote is something I often speak up against, which is the false claim that Stoicism is about austerity. Self-deprivation in and of itself is not virtuous. Of all the ancient Stoic teachers, Seneca is the most vocal on this topic as well. He is the one that reminds us it is okay to be entertained. It is okay to have some wine. It is okay to indulge in the little things that help us unwind, rest and relax, for our minds and bodies are tools and just like any tool, overuse and discipline can harm it, damage it and be counterproductive.

But it is the other half of this quote that is interesting. He is reminding us that unlike our Cynic older cousins, as Stoics we do not remove ourselves from custom. We recognize the fictitious nature of this society we live in, however, we chose to participate in this fake construct so as to be able to help our fellow cosmopolitans. We cannot be on the outside looking in and try and influence people. We must be part of society to be able to have the greatest impact towards the betterment of humanity (the human community). We’re agents working from the inside trying to be agents for positive change as it were.

And this is what Seneca is reminding us as it pertains to holiday gatherings. Okay, so this won’t be pertinent for most of us as we are on varying degrees of lockdown. Personally, in Montreal, we are on full lockdown so we can’t be with anyone. However, the lesson is still sound and something we can all reflect on even in isolation. Don’t try and be too austere. Don’t overindulge. Don’t unduly deprive yourself. Don’t be reliant on externals. The name of the game is equanimity…balance…focusing on the only things that matters: Our judgments and intentions.

**So as an exercise this week, reflect on your plans for the holidays, no matter what they may be. Are planning too much on Netflix? Drinks? Shopping? Social media? Self-pity in self-isolation? Are you planning on ignoring the holidays altogether?** Consider what it is you plan on and ask yourself: **What value is this going to bring to me or humanity?** Never forget that the starting point is ALWAYS will this help me work towards the betterment of humanity? Will this help make the world a better place. This is the starting point, even for the holidays.

I Ho Ho Hope you have a great week (yup…I’m sorry for that…I am a dad and cannot pass up a good opportunity for a dad joke). We can all take the opportunity this holiday season to become a little bit more virtuous, without ignoring the customs of our society.

Your friends

1,"Would a daily journal about my journey into stoic practice be welcome on this subreddit? I'm a 28-year-old man who is at somewhat of a turning point in my life after a difficult year. Some inner wisdom had led me to seriously considering Stoicism (along with some other practices) as an antidote to the emotional chaos I've been experiencing of late. While I'm not a complete newcomer to the philosophy — I have read the Aurelius meditations a few times am familiar with basic Stoic theory and virtue ethics — I have never seriously considered implementing it in my life in practice until now. 

I'm considering writing a daily(ish) online journal in which I reflect on what's happened in my life and what lessons I've learned regarding Stoic practice. While I do plan on taking up Stoic study more seriously (I've just bought a copy of Seneca's Letters from a Stoic and the Discourses of Epictetus), the focus of the journal will be on practical examples of what I have experienced, what I did right and wrong, and how I plan to change my actions and attitudes moving forward. 

I'm wondering if this subreddit an appropriate forum for such a journal? More importantly, I'm trying to figure out whether writing the journal has the potential to help others or would just be a narcissistic exercise. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts."

1,"Look things in the face and know them for what they are. A couple of days ago I decided to make a drastic change, It might not be so drastic for you guys but this was my escape from reality. This was the thing that was keeping all my demons away from me. I deleted every single game from my computer, something I knew I should have done a while ago but always said to myself that it's too dramatic. These were internal excuses I was making up in my head to protect myself from reality. So I finally decided to pull the trigger.

Deep down I think all of us know what we should be doing, and when we don't do that certain thing it slowly starts eating us from within. It starts killing our confidence since we realize we can't even take control of the only things within our control. I moved to America 2 years ago and a lot of my ideas did not go to plan, so I used video games to escape reality. Seeing beautifully designed worlds, unlocking new achievements, learning new skills all made me stop thinking of all the real issues I was experiencing in real life and it gave me this false illusion of accomplishing something. 

You can't outrun your personal issues until you confront them internally. You have to fight a battle no one can fight for you. When you use outlets like games, drugs, alcohol, your partner, and social circle to make you feel better it's always temporary. It's crucial you don't bullshit yourself... look at things in the face and know them for what they are. Every night when I went to sleep a swarm of thoughts came to my mind knowing I lied to myself and withheld myself from taking action on my dreams. I feared trying because I have failed in the past before, I feared trying because I would be accountable for something important. But I trusted my gut this time and pulled the trigger.

My OCD kicked in after I deleted everything, this time there was nowhere to escape. For the next couple of days, I lived in my head, all sorts of negative, disgusting, and miserable thoughts swarmed my mind. I lost touch with reality since I was so stuck trying to deal with not thinking. But I used this extremely fucked up situation to better myself, to actually confront it. I felt the pain of being lost, I felt so fucking lost.. not knowing what the next step in my life will be... acknowledging how much time I have lost and how much I have lied to myself. The saddest part is not taking account of actions you are 100% capable of. 

But I feel empowered by taking this step in my life. I feel empowered by dealing with my issues instead of running away from them. Every day I start my day with some physical activities and meditation which has been helping me out a lot. I'm not going to lie, I'm still figuring things out. I'm still deciding what my next steps in my career will be, how I will be getting there, and so on. I know this is a healthy step for my future and dealing with everything I hid from myself. But please do yourself a favor and call yourself out on your bullshit, do the things you know you should be doing, and don't give in to that inner bitch! You know exactly what bullshit I'm referring to.

1,"The Virtuous Cycle of Virtue I was reading A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy by William B. Irvine where he boils down the stoic definition of ""the good life"" to virtue and tranquility. As I've thought more about those principles, I've realized that they make a virtuous cycle, both reinforcing the other. 

As we live virtuously, we aren't weighed down by guilt or the inevitable consequences of cutting corners. This allows us to have tranquility. We add more tranquility by letting go of things outside the scope of our control. Having this tranquility makes it easier to live virtuously, as we all make better decisions with less stress and frustration. 

Thus the virtuous cycle of virtue!"

He doesn’t do a third but now I’m left realizing my virtue of courage did not manifest in that moment even though I know what I was witnessing wasn’t just in any way. So now would there be any logical reason where some action in seeking fairness would result in justice?

Stoicism (without) Logos/Embrace your fate/ just seems like an upbringing many of us perhaps experienced.   Is the appeal of Stoicism that there is more explanation ""meat"" on the bones  because it just seems so familiar (if you leave out the providence/logos part)....

But recently I'm beginning to learn that intelligence is like height.....you have to work with what you have. Besides genetic lottery factors such as education, career, network and level of exposure to certain experiences greatly dictate how far you can go. 

I guess the answer is to accept your limit and work towards improving/doing the best you can regardless, because that's virtuous. But would like to read some of the original texts to learn how to better accept the disappointment as it's much easier to accept that you failed at a certain endeavour because you can try again...and you might succeed the next time. But how do you keep going down the path to getting smarter when you know you simply don't possess the mental horsepower that you would have liked to possess.

1,6 Constructive Daily Stoic quotes 
1,"A practical saying to say to yourself Hello all, I saw earlier a post about a good practical saying to tell yourself when trouble comes about. Arrian has also given us a good saying to work with whenever you encounter trouble in life. 

""Make a start, then, with small things. A drop of oil is spilled, a little wine is stolen; say to yourself, ‘Such is the price at which equanimity is bought; such is the price that one pays for peace of mind.’ For nothing can be acquired at no cost at all.""

To expand on this, here he is telling us that tranquility, equanimity and peace of mind are not free. We all want equanimity but not all want to pay for it by practicing in troubled moments. So whenever you encounter adversity, remember that it is neccessary and by facing it you will get closer to equanimity."

I'm Greek, born here, raised most of my life here, still live here (it's not as you think it's poverty and ghetto don't get excited). For a long enough time now ""it is what it is, life moves forward"" has been my main quote dealing with everything from inconveniences to even tragedy, yes we mourn but we cannot stop progressing in life sadly.

Anyway today I happened to stumble upon a video about ""Stoicism"" with the title ""Stoicism: The Art Of Not Caring"" I almost brushed it off as I already practice this most of the time but the setting and all seemed interesting so I said since I got nothing else to watch I'm gonna shoot it a shot might as well.

Surprised to find out it's basically my mentality and my way of thinking, not only this  but it originates from my country's ancestors. Now I'm really not a patriot, nor do I care about history, I believe in progress and history is the past, no need to know what cavemen and the romes did while our struggle has just begun, almost failed history. 

But, I am 100% certain this has not **ONCE** been mentioned in a history book here, I think the why is obvious, they do not want people to be oblivious, they want us to be stressed so we work as we're told. 

We all know we're taught what they want to teach us, censor or even overwrite history, but I felt like this had to be mentioned here.

1,"Health and wealth - in our control or indifferent? I'm currently reading ""The Little Book of Stoicism"" written by Jonas Salzberger. He states that there are things that are in our control and things that aren't. When he first mentioned that health and wealth are not under our control, I thought to myself ""right, some people have a non-curable diseases since their birth and some aren't able to work in fields that pay well"". 

But during ~20 pages he mentions this statement 4-5 times without talking about that for health you are responsible in a way that you shouldn't smoke, exercise some time, eat healthy etc. And for wealth one can invest, learn a new skill and so on.

So what bothers me, is that (at least in the book I'm reading) there is the narrative of health and wealth being out of our control. I get that there are things especially about our health that we can't change, but the majority of aspects are in our hands, at least in my opinion.

Basically I've been through a rough period in september and I've had a lot of trouble not ruminating on the same thoughts constantly. So I thought to myself, I've pretty much allowed myself to think about the matter enough and I will not profit by thinking any more about it. Yet intrusive, ""empty"" thoughts kept coming back and I had a lot of trouble not giving them any more attention than they deserve once they had appeared. I've placed a rubber band on my wrist and now every time a thought about that particular period about the situation in which I had no control over someone elses actios comes up, I pull back the rubber band and let loose. This stops the unwanted thought process quite quickly.

1,"Acne and Stoicism Recently I’ve been pretty concerned about my current situation with how my face looks and, in the end, I think I had the answer right in front of me: Stoicism practice. 

Maybe not as the absolute answer but the way to see this situation. I’ve been dealing with acne for years now, sometimes more sometimes less. I even had my face clear at some moments in my life. And I know that for some people that had it worse my face is really nice, so apart from stoicism I had to accept that I’m not the only one on this journey.

Learning about stoicism during the last two years had me resolving this problem with two perspectives that I’ve been practising recently:

- One is amor fati: in this case I opted to ignore the way my face looks at every moment. It will be what future decides, not me. I even think sometimes my acne comes down to overthink the cause of the problem.

- The other is to focus on what I can control: I’m doing things right (good health, sports, nutrition and calm) and there are times where I would get acne for no reason. So I know I’m doing what I’ supposed to do, and that’s what matters.

I struggle with this a bit, when talking with my girlfriend or others, we can be talking about emotionally charged topics, but I feel wrong in a sense for not being visibly shocked or horrified about certain subjects. It is not like I tell myself ""stoics shouldn't be visibly emotional about this"", I have no problem showing emotion when it is genuine to me, but often times that is just not where my mind goes, and if I feign emotion then I feel wrong again.

To be clear, I do often feel the same emotion of the person I am in conversation with, but I rarely feel genuine in displaying the frustration, anger or sadness that they do or I suppose is usual in these situations.

I have not been challenged or questioned about appearing unemotional. It is just something I feel and it bothers me a bit. I would like to know how to explain and talk about why this is which is not ""I practice stoicism"". I want to be able to explain it in a more relatable and non-preachy way."

In short, if we observe, we shall find that the animal man is pained by nothing so much as by that which is irrational; and, on the contrary, attracted to nothing so much as to that which is rational.\](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/epictetus/discourses/george-long/text/book-1#chapter-1-2)

I've found this to be a powerful observation; when something disturbs me, if I can see some sensible reason for it, it will likely disturb me much less.

The funny thing about this is that everything, if we look closely enough, is reasonable. Why did that tree fall on my car? If was big and heavy and unbalanced, and it was rotting at the base and had a crack in it. You parked under it the very day that crack finally let go, because you couldn't see how precarious it was. There's always a sensible reason for everything - and I don't mean this is a religious way or a fateful way, I mean that there is just a simple chain of cause and effect behind everything, and each link in that chain is always just as reasonable as can be. 

If we could see all of it, nothing would ever appear unreasonable to us. Just the very fact that a thing has occurred is proof that it is a result of some sensible process.

So I was at Home Depot today, picking up some materials to finish a difficult project, and I encountered the usual sorts of annoyances there that might set anyone off. I did what most of us do, catching myself and checking myself, and taking the time to explain to myself that these things were normal and natural and nothing to make a fuss over.

And after a few seconds of this, for what felt like the first time ever, it just sort of clicked. \_It was unnecessary to explain.\_ Of course this is reasonable, what else could it be? My usual practice was just chatter. Everything is fine.

This feeling lasted maybe half an hour. Various other minor challenges - an unstaffed drive in window at Arbys, the discovery that a necessary part clearly won't fit without extensive modification - were just things to be handled, not argued with. Perfectly sensible things, unobjectionable things, that plainly felt sensible and unobjectionable. It was nice.

I'm going to spend a lot of time trying to become more familiar with this feeling."
1,"Attraction and Stoicism Hello, Id like to preface this by saying my understanding of Stoicism and it’s practices are not very extensive, as i’ve only become interested fairly recently. However, it does seem like something very applicable to day to day lives. This made me wonder what the best course of action is in certain everyday interactions. For example, I’ve recently began talking to someone i’m interested in, but i’m concerned with whether i should just enjoy the present and not push for anything further, or take action towards what I want to do (eg: ask for her number). It seems like there is a huge gap between living in the present while being content and doing what one wants to do. Apologies if this isn’t the best sub for this or anything like that, but any advice would help."

1,"How is death perceived in stoicism? Intresting quote in anime ""When he died he became more beautiful than anyone among the living. He's love itself. He'll never hate other or steal anymore. He was abandoned there. He's going to give his body with generosity to the beasts and insects. He lies exposed to the wind and rain, but won't speak a single word in complaint. Death, perfects a person...death is the essence of love."" -Father Willibald 

 I heard this quote while watching vindland saga, an anime about vikings. How can this quote on death relate to how stoicism views death?"

1,"I Cannot Change My GF and It Frustrates Me, how to be stoic about this Basically I realized my GF admires material possessions to much. She is glamorized by a instagram diva life of women that are fake and unreal that have older men I'm sure paying for their needs. She's a smart person but glamorizes this maybe because she came from a poorer background. While I was born into wealthy parents. I seem to admire the idea of love, a long quality partner and companship. I believe I choose all my partners because I enjoyed spending time with them and see something unique in them. But she says she values stability and kindness and being treated well. I don't see this as a way I see love and seeing the other person as irreplaceable partner or atleast hard to acquire. I basically turned down many girls due to the fact I got along with her better because she's smart and find her attractive. Yet after some time I realize our values don't align and I believe maybe it's a bad idea to try to change her. I gave her my 2 cents wisely and she's slowly changed for the better since I meet her in terms of materialism and other things. But i still fundamental differences in the way we view the world and changing someone is not the way. Any advice, i feel frustrated and distance myself for days because of some of her comments. Part of me really likes her and wish she would be a better person, love me for me and appreciate my unique qualities and understand getting along with someone is rarer, reducing her money admiration and we could live a happy life. By the way I'm doing well financially, not rich but I'm doing well, The other part of me believes that i should move on and find someone that holds similar values and even if I will miss her. My fear of loosing her and possessing her being alone is not a way to hold a relationship. Anyways let me know right stoic way."

This lockdown has been extremely hard for my younger brothers, who are in high school. They are failing virtual classes, getting depressed and anxious, and I just found out the younger one started smoking pot. (Nothing against pot, I smoke it here and there, but he’s just to young, and also I know from personal use that it can make mental health go downhill fast if you over use it)

I also have another younger brother who’s older than them, who is in rehab for addiction. 

I can’t get my mind away from my brothers. I am just always so concerned for them, and just want their mental health to be good. I don’t know what I can do besides my constant advice (and what do I really know, I’m doing my best in life but I’m no genius). I am so scared for them all the time. It’s like I know life is tough, and growing up is hard, but I feel like I have to do it all over again with each of them.

Is there a way to help them? Is there a way to stop myself from my severe anxiety for them?"

I came across this after loosing my temper at my son for stepping on a counter edge to get a drink cup. I immediately felt bad and I doubted my commitment to the teachings.

And the fact my father was drunk and hit my mom so I had to stop them so it scarred me pretty bad.

At this point, I cannot afford to spend that much amount for a 5 days trip as I am saving money to make capital for my startup company.

So, instead I joined gym earlier this evening and just returned from my first ever work out in long years. I decided, I'm gonna make more money in coming months and then I'll go for the trek. By that time, I'll be in better shape with good stamina that can help me enjoy the trek even better.

1,"Feeling guilt regarding my father's cancer diagnosis and stoicism I feel extremely conflicted. I'm 24, my father is in his 70s and he has been diagnosed with colon cancer. I have rightfully cried a few times and I love him a massive amount. 

He is staying really stoic about this, and he has had a great life, but on the other hand it's my dad, man :( . I want him to see his grandchildren, I want him to be there when I get married, I want to see him make his breakfast so many more times, everything...

And then I read some Aurelius or Seneca and I immediately feel a calmth wash over me. And I think you know what, he HAS had a great life with insane, amazing adventures (I'm not just saying that, they are literally movie worthy). And then I go downstairs, see him there, know he's suffering with cancer and I just feel so insanely guilty about those 'stoic' thoughts. Like, that's the man who held me when I fell down, that's the man who was there when I was a little kid running around, and now I am here belittling his suffering by saying 'well, he has had a long life and I am not going to suffer more than I have to'.

I've read some other posts here about this, with people saying they were so 'stoic' they didn't even cry at their parents' funerals. I'm sorry but that physically disgusts me, how can we not cry when our parents pass? How can we be at peace with not feeling these feelings? Are the deep scars inflicted upon us when they suffer or die not testaments to the love we feel for them?

Please help me deal with these feelings of guilt. Thank you."

1,"£1000+ Stoic Reflection Hi all

It is one month since I began my Stoic journey after a friend recommended A Guide to the Good Life by William B Irvine. I wanted to share a recent event that tested my new found  Stoic practice.

&lt;b&gt;Event:&lt;\b&gt;

In [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceEurope/comments/k8jspa/10000_sek_postal_mishap/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) I describe how I lost a valuable deliverable to factors outside of my control. 

&lt;b&gt;The Challenge:&lt;\b&gt;

This brought an exceptional degree of stress to me, and for almost an entire day I was possessed with stress, anxiety, accusation and financial concern. My mind spiraled into a bad state, one which I felt powerless to escape from - as if caugh up in some chain reaction of anxiety or fighting against an ocean swell. That is until I heard a silent voice in my mind telling me to ""remember""... to remember my new found comitment to my Stoic practice.

 &lt;b&gt; The Action: &lt;\b&gt;

I took a moment to meditate on the situation, which lead to the realisation of ""things as they"" I reminded myself that the loss was materialistic... metal and plastic, a financial expense that came from a work bonus, a regreful loss but in the grand scheme of things - an inconsequential loss at that and a luxury that I can one day recover.

 I felt my mind settle,  as if a storm had subsided over a turbulent ocean. I segregated tasks into those under my control, those partially under my control and those things completely out of my control.

I patiently went through the steps to claim compensation (if any). I spoke calmly and politely to the respective customer service teams and now remain hopeful of a positive outcome but I know this to be beyond my control in this case. When the task was complete, I let the issue leave my mind and felt a deep calm overcome me and I moved on with my day.

&lt;b&gt;Posterior Reflection:&lt;\b&gt;

While this is not by any means a catastropic event, It has provided a valuable lesson and exercise in reclaiming my mind from a manifested state of chaotic irrationality. 

I also reflected on how I could have easily missed out on this opportunity if it was not for that little voice reminding me of my comiment to Stoic practice. For this reason I have taken it upon myself to create a psychogical anchor, a conscious, inwards probing of my mind, and a reminder to check up on ""The inner Stoic"". I will achieve this by repeating to myself ""remember your stoic practice"" several times a day and when faced with adversity ... "" What would Marcus do?"".

1,5 Practical Stoic Quotes on Productivity 
1,"“The Man in the Arena,” a quote from Theodore Roosevelt "
1,"Stoicism &amp; Suicide - ""For he in whom there are many things which are in accordance with nature, his duty it is to remain in life; but as to the man in whom there either is or appears likely to be a preponderance of things contrary to nature, that man's duty is to depart from life."" - Cicero From an excerpt of Cicero's work on Stoic philosophy, we have one of the most succint takes on the Stoic view of suicide and how it doesn't contradict any of its tenets. As there is polemic and division on this particular subject, it is important to return to the sources and not merely a surface interpretation from a modern perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; For he in whom there are many things which are in accordance with nature, his duty it is to remain in life; **but as to the man in whom there either is or appears likely to be a preponderance of things contrary to nature, that man's duty is to depart from life.** From which consideration it is evident, that it is sometimes the duty of a wise man to depart from life when he is happy, and sometimes the duty of a fool to remain in life though he is miserable. For that good and that evil, as has been often said, comes afterwards. But those principal natural goods, and those which hold the second rank, and those things which are opposite to them, all come under the decision of, and are matters for the reflection of the wise man; and are, as it were, the subject matter of wisdom. Therefore the question of remaining in life, or of emigrating from it, is to be measured by all those circumstances which I have mentioned above; for death is not to be sought for by those men who are retained in life by virtue, nor by those who are destitute of virtue. **But it is often the duty of a wise man to depart from life, when he is thoroughly happy, if it is in his power to do so opportunely; and that is living in a manner suitable to nature, for their maxim is, that living happily depends upon opportunity. Therefore a rule is laid down by wisdom, that if it be necessary a wise man is even to leave her herself.** 

Of which this is said to be a wise decision, taken for the sake of staying within the reason of nature. For even life can be laid down in the service of virtue, it can also be taken in order to deny it from vice - as in the case of Cato who chose to deny Caesar the pleasure of letting him live in dishonor to humiliate his adversary. This is similar to another popular form of suicide called Sepuku from the Samurai tradition. Once the Samurai is stripped of all honor and has no more reason to live, he is to die as it were to maintain dignity. 

However this isn't an easy task, and for those who are foolish, it is recommended to endure and continue learning:

&gt; Wherefore, as vice has not such power as to afford a justifying cause for voluntary death, it is evident that it is the duty even of fools, and of those too who are miserable, to remain in life, if they are surrounded by a preponderance of those things which we call according to nature. And since such a man is equally miserable, whether departing from life, or abiding in it, and since the duration of misery is not any the more a cause for fleeing from life, therefore it is not a causeless assertion, that those men who have the power of enjoying the greatest number of natural goods, ought to abide in life. 

Hence, it is not to be taken lightly, and to seek respite from that misery with the use of virtue, and nowadays therapy and counseling. Which makes this not a subject of dogmatic adherence to life as if it were an absolute good, but a matter of careful deliberation guided by wisdom. 

Lastly, Seneca's praise to Cato:

&gt; I am sure that the gods looked on with exceeding joy while that hero, most ruthless in avenging himself, took thought for the safety of others and arranged the escape of his departing followers; while even on his last night he pursued his studies; while he drove the sword into his sacred breast; while he scattered his vitals, and drew forth by his hand that holiest spirit, too noble to be defiled by the steel. I should like to believe that this is why the wound was not well-aimed and efficacious — it was not enough for the immortal gods to look but once on Cato. **His virtue was held in check and called back that it might display itself in a harder role; for to seek death needs not so great a soul as to reseek it. Surely the gods looked with pleasure upon their pupil as he made his escape by so glorious and memorable an end!** 

But perhaps all of these authors were wrong and Cato didn't really understand Stoicism. He should just have not cared at all about externals and be so above it all that he could have just accepted the will of Caesar. After all, letting people dominate you and humiliate you is Stoic because freedom doesn't matter, laws don't matter, nothing matters! Just that you, uh, remain in virtue or something. Which only means to not care. That's what Reddit taught me, after all. The most Stoic thing is to not care, so Cato was not Stoic. Or so I hear. Oh man, whom do I listen to, the philosophers or the users? Anybody have a clue what the real answer is?"

1,"How to accept that you will not be able to help someone who doesn't want to be helped? I know stoicism is mostly about focusing on what I can control but really breaks my heart to think that I have to give up on my father. He's in his late 60s and is morbidly obese -- he has been since I was young. For so many years I've tried to get him to adopt a healthier lifestyle, but his ego holds him back. He's a very ""traditional"" male, who often refers to himself as the Alpha of the family, is extremely egotistic, and is the epithet of toxic masculinity. I love him very much, and he does have a lot of very good qualities, but his ego is causing his destruction. I've tried to help him ease into different diets by adjusting his meals and dedicating an hour every morning to exercise (gently-- because of his weight) with him. However, he always falls back to his binging and unwillingness to move around. He sits for 14 hours a day watching Netflix. Understandably, he is retired and deserve his rest, but even with me asking him just to stand up for 10 mins per episode causes him to retaliate. Especially these few months, when his weight has been the heaviest it's ever been, he gets extremely angry whenever I try to suggest that he move around or at least get his own cup of tea instead of bossing my poor mother around (because he still possesses misogynistic ideals that wives should serve their husbands). He also orders a lot of fast food and desserts DAILY for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, despite my mother cooking up healthy meals for him because they ""aren't his taste"". Whenever I try to suggest that he eat better, it just turns into an argument and blames it on my mother for ""cooking too slow"". The other day, we had a full blown argument (more of him screaming at me) because he told me to stop nagging at him, proceeding to throw in a bunch of insults at me and my own insecurities.

I realise now that I truly can't help him if he doesn't let himself be helped because I think it hurts his ego when I try to ask him to be healthier, because he feels I'm implying that I think he is fat, and he is extremely insecure about his weight. It's quite ironic because he was actually the one who introduced me to stoicism, but he believes that anger and ego are necessities to survive life. And yes, I gifted him Ego Is The Enemy by Ryan Holiday but it has since been donated away. I don't know what else to do but to let him be and live my own life better in the hopes of influencing his own lifestyle. I know that nobody is perfect, and other than his ego and anger issues, I think he has been wonderful father (not necessarily a great husband, though). He doesn't have any other addictions like drinking, smoking, having affairs, or drug abuse, and he was never violent. He just has so much anger and impatience and ego Still, guilt is eating me up, and I've read from Meditations some time ago that I shouldn't give up on people no matter how difficult they are (I can't find the exact quote, but that was what I got out of it). It is so difficult to watch him destroy himself especially now that he's getting older. I feel like I have to help him, but I know I can't, and I just find that so difficult to accept. It's just like I'm letting him kill himself. I don't know what to do anymore."
1,"Pleasures keep me from comitting suicide All these mindless pleasures like surfing the web, food, porn etc. I feel are keeping me alive as even though they numb me, they also make me keep going through this suffering that life gives me. The only people I really have are my family, who I think are also as suicidal as me. 

The only reason I keep going is because I can't leave my family behind and also because I'm curious to see what is going to happen to this world. I'm gay and I know I'll never reproduce. 

I've been reading stoicism alot these last couple of years and one thing that I can't seem to do is to give up these pleasures as I can't live without them.

1,"You don't have 'control' but 'power' over your thoughts. there is a difference Correct me if I'm wrong but

There are days where a hollow thought can't stop poking my in the head, even when I have reasoned with it rationally, I wrote it down, stripped down impression and reasoned with it and figured the next action or if the thought is not worth pursuing or doesn't meet virute. 

I expected it to be eliminated, but I woke up with it every morning, It pissed me off for weeks (maybe i kept getting it, cause i wanted to get rid of it), it still comes around from time to time, but I learned it the hard way,  we don't 'control' our thoughts, but we can accept them, get detached by them, not give up our power,realize we are not out (first-hand) thoughts but what we do with them, then think rationally(which I believe is us, our truly own faculties) stripping out impression, viewing as a third person or from the above. then act on it.

bottom line - we are not out thoughts and feelings, we are what we do with them. 

I believe when marcus said 'the thoughts of our mind color our soul' , he meant how 'we choose' to look at these things which our vessel (body hence brain) provides us with, which has his human errors, thats why we need to practice stoicism to overcome our old mentality, stripping out impressions, thinking over thoughts and how do we feel about them, what does it mean to you. and then have the power to influence it in whatever way you have examined it.

So next time you feel strong about of any thought or a feeling, just be self-aware, observe, accept and examine it first.  Detach yourself, apply your tools and wisdoms you have to the situation, then USE THE POWER YOU HAVE OVER YOUR THOUGHTS to take back control and influence your will by motivation and the eventual action. 

What I think I did wrong - I hated the thought's existence in my mind, it destroyed my peace after it kept coming back and back again, Instead I should ve also examined this feeling and realised it being there in my head does nothing to me, so I should not feeling anything about, cause at it literally was a hollow thought from my own fear of having that thought. I cannot control this kind of thought, my mind is a monkey, I can only focus on peace and the real thinking me stripping out everything else."

1,"“You haven’t been acting stoic lately” I introduced my friend to stoicism and have offered to borrow him some of the staple literature I own. He likes to refer to himself as stoic and I believe he watches a few YouTube videos about it every now and then, but I sort of worry that he misunderstands it for not caring about anything (among other things). I do feel as if he only likes to call himself a stoic for the purpose of feeling trendy/cool (i.e. when he has girls over I sometimes hear him improperly explaining stoicism and talking about how he’s stoic which is a pretty silly thing to do) but it’s not really my place to judge, all I can do is offer my collection of books surrounding the topic. 

I’ve had a few arguments with our other roommate due to some of his actions which I perceive to be grossly unjust. I deliberated long and hard over whether or not it would be the wisest thing to do in the situation beforehand, and decided I needed to speak my truth.

Now the friend who says he’s a stoic is saying “you haven’t been acting like a stoic lately” to me and I don’t know how to respond. I want to tell him that he completely misunderstands stoicism, and that him bending over backwards to please our negligent roommate and walking on eggshells to avoid confrontation at all costs is not a stoic thing to do, because he cares more about pleasing others than he does about doing what he knows is right - what someone who has respect for themselves would do. 

I hate to say it, but him saying this to me has been bothering me more than anything else lately, because I’m very passionate about the philosophy and do my best to maintain virtue while he doesn’t take it as seriously but likes to stroke his ego over the thought of him being a stoic. I don’t know if I should explain why I did what I did to him and try to teach him or if I should just let him continue to misunderstand."

1,"Stoicism, Therapy, and Wise Mind (Sorry if the flair I chose is incorrect. Please let me know if I need to fix it.)

Hello everyone! I’m quite new here. I had heard about and watched videos of Stoicism before, but I’ve started diving much deeper into it only a couple of weeks ago. This subreddit has been very helpful.

Before I continue, I ask the readers of this post to correct me if something I say falls contradictory to Stoicism. As I said, I’m a beginner, and I’m still learning, so any feedback will be appreciated!

When I was reading on Stoicism, I immediately recognized how heavily Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) was based on it. DBT is an incredibly effective technique that is used to treat highly suicidal individuals, emotion dysregulation, treatment-resistant depression, and more. It heavily relies on skills such as mindfulness, nonjudgmental approach, radical acceptance of reality, and more. Those who are familiar with DBT will recognize how closely these practices are connected to Stoic ones.

One of the core concepts of DBT is that us humans have three States of Mind. Reasonable Mind is that in which we are ruled by facts, logic, and pragmatism. It is the “cool,” rational mind that ignores values and emotions. Emotion Mind is that in which we are ruled by emotions, feelings, and judgements. It is the “hot,” mood-dependent mind that ignores reason. Finally, there’s Wise Mind. Wise Mind is described as “walking the middle path.” It is the dialectical synthesis of both Reasonable Mind and Emotion Mind. It is the intuitive wisdom that exists within every person.

A goal of DBT is to teach the student to recognize which State of Mind they’re in at a given time and to find ways to bring themselves to Wise Mind if they’re not already in it in the first place. DBT teaches us how to act “from Wise Mind,” skillfully and effectively, which sounds a lot like Stoic behavior to me.

While I was practicing Wise Mind several days ago, I noticed that it’s quite difficult for me to bring myself back from, say, Emotion Mind without following predetermined steps, so I decided to sit down and create a series of questions that could help me determine if I am acting wisely at a given time and, if not, determine what I could do to fix it. I combined everything I knew about DBT and Stoicism into it. Now, whenever I’m spending hours looking at my phone whereas I need to do something else that needs my attention, I pull up the list on my phone, read it, answer the questions, and change my actions accordingly.

I decided to share these steps and questions here in the hopes that I could get feedback on whether they fit well with Stoic concepts and teachings. I also wanted to be able to give some guidance to those like me who might need it.

Here it goes:

How to Get to Wise Mind

Observe your State of Mind. Ask yourself:

Which State of Mind am I in? Reasonable Mind or Emotion Mind? Label it. Describe it. Experience it. Radically accept it.

What would Wise Mind compel me to do?

Are my actions virtuous? [I added this question to remind myself to consider if my actions are hurting a fellow human being.]

Do my actions constitute as living according to my nature? [This is for harmful actions such as sleeping more than my body needs, eating too much or too little, wanting to eat junk food, spending three hours after midnight surfing Reddit, etc.]

Do my actions violate my personal moral compass?

Am I acting effectively? Am I acting skillfully?

Will my actions improve my life in the long term, or am I just seeking short-term relief?

Am I acting willfully? If so, why? Is there a threat? If so, does this threat fit the facts of reality, or is it just my own judgement or interpretation of present or future external events?

If there truly is a threat, is it under my control? If so, solve it effectively. If not, imagine the threat really occurring. Accept that you cannot change it. Imagine coping well with the threat, then move on.

If the threat is merely a consequence of your thoughts or emotions, accept that you are thinking or feeling this way. Experience and describe the thoughts or emotions, then, when it is time, let them go.

Remind yourself: Memento mori. Memento vivere. [I added these classic quotes to remind myself that there’s still so much I want to accomplish in life, and wasting time doing unnecessary side quests that keep me in my comfort zone won’t help.]

Thanks for reading!"
1,"Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus What does stoicism have to say about the conflict between trusting oneself as opposed to cooperating with someone else? Allow me to pose a hypothetical. 

You’re starting a business. You have someone who you could partner with, who doesn’t do things the way you do, but has a ton of knowledge that compliments your own. You don’t always like the decisions they make, but they’re trustworthy and reliable. Or, you could do it alone, knowing the workload would be extreme, but it would be solely your vision. 

The business may suffer if you do it alone, but if you partner up, you give up the chance to have things exactly your way. Do you trust yourself or do you compromise? I’m finding it impossible to figure out in this (hypothetical) situation where ego ends and self confidence begins, since this person would bring things to the table that you couldn’t. Please ponder with me."
1,"Does Stoicism have an equivalent similar to Tao’s “Wu Wei”, a state of “flow” where man effortlessly takes action without thinking or rational thought, but spontaneously through intuition alone, similar to instinct? A state of intense creativity you tapped into momentarily without effort, where you’re being devoured with this linguistic, artistic, inventive, or whatever feeling it may have been in your particular craft, that pops out of nowhere flooding you with incredible ideas and limitless energy that almost override your neural circuitry, and then quickly leaves.

We’ve all felt this before. That split moment we enter where we write without stopping, the words just pour out effortlessly, and we’re left thinking afterwards “What just happened to me?”. When you’re so “into the zone” that for a moment, time stops, and nothing else but you exists.

Another simple example would be the last 30 seconds of a sports championship final match. Your body moves on its own. You have no time to think, strategize, rationalize, or plan. You act purely in the moment on instinct alone, spontaneously.

Does Stoicism have a name for this?"

1,"Stoicism, Ethics, and Fairness in a Competitive Workplace I am not a particularly competitive person by nature and I have often found working in competitive workplaces annoying and a bit anxiety-provoking. Over the last three years I had to work with an extremely competitive group of people and, as the newcomer, I was the object of little but continuous acts of belittlement and of unjustifiable neglect by the group leader. I could not establish any significant interaction with my coworkers who, in turn, seemed to be involved in a years-long war against one another to win the approval of the leader: backstabbing and betrayal were commonplace. In spite of this pressure, I managed to perform reasonably well and achieved some meaningful results. However, during the last two months of the project, I experienced a surge of hostility towards me, culminated with one of my coworkers trying to steal some sensitive data I had been collecting for the previous three years. I immediately realised my colleague's intentions and secured those data. Then, I took advantage of both the end of my project and the mounting second wave of covid-19 in my country to cut any ties I had with them. I've never come across such a level of wickedness and I feel like my own worldview has been tainted in some way: I am very concerned about finding myself again in a similar, appalling situation in the forthcoming future and I feel I will not be able to trust anyone at work anymore. How can I read my own experience through the lenses of Stoicism and how can I navigate again the world around me more securely? How can I conciliate this experience of merciless competitiveness with the Stoic concept of ecumenism/cosmopolitanism?

Thanks for your replies and suggestions."

1,"How do i deal with negative emotions associated with sex in my mind? For context I'm 22m. Now I was in relationship with a woman 21 of age. Everything aside while writing my emotions I realized something and I am not sure how to deal with it. 

It was sort of a long distance and I engaged in phone sex. I liked it. My gf didn't so much. And she just eventually backed out of it. I took it personally. It caused me great amount of suffering to know that my partner doesn't feel the same way as i do about something I enjoy. All of the negative emotions and attributes you can think of came to me. I became self centered (as in what I was not getting from her without asking her what she wants) , I was too eager for sex, I felt envious that she has so much sexual experience and I don't , I felt these emotions so much that it drove me crazy enough to affect other aspects of life. I realised I felt so insecure about sex as if I needed a constant validation from her. 
Even after break up, this emotion of inadequacy because of sex affects me. Now, there is a reason I am a virgin it's just not culturally expected of me where I live and I didn't want to go against tide for something as trivial(or so I thought) plus the amount of effort I had to put for this and the risk I had to bear was not worth it. But now, my mind wanders between ""am I just making an excuse for not having sex? "", "" Could I even do it even if I wanted to? "" . It is only now that I have taken the hold of my life back. But these thoughts still haunt me.

I don't feel sexual attraction to just anyone. Infact I only felt sexually attracted to my gf after we emotionally bonded. And this is all over phone sex not even real sex. 

I am having a hard time fitting sex into my value system. 
I am very new to stoicism and want to know what would be the stoic perspective on my issue. 

(Additional information, I could conveniently forgoe sexual pursuit in past and even romantic relationship f or that matter because culturally I am expected to put effort into career first and then my family shall chose partner for me ( I know a lot can go wrong there as well but I didn't see a reason to fight that norm back then) )"

They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.”

Saying avoid toxic people implies that you should build this safe space around you, and not acknowledge the reality that everyday perhaps everyone you deal with will be rude and arrogant and lying and hurtful, but always to work with these people and to learn from this 

“If someone is able to show me that what I think or do is not right, I will happily change, for I seek the truth, by which no one was ever truly harmed. It is the person who continues in his self-deception and ignorance who is harmed.”"
1,"What stoic books should I first get into? Through all suffering, I always found a safe haven in stoicism, it helped me be more neutral how my life really went all the way down.After being through a lot, I realized that I need to move on, and I was mostly attracted by Seneca and his view on TIME, which I struggle to manage in my daily life.Reading is my only real ""escape"".

How do you know when you should work harder? Communicate more? Keep trying? My particular issue is in regards to a relationship, so it's not like a test that you either pass or don't pass, it's on-going, and I keep second guessing myself. Did I do enough? Did I communicate enough? 

This particular issue, I'm anxiously obsessing that I'm not communicating well enough even though I'm doing my best and it's coming from a place of love. I have ocd, so I keep wanting to check on what I've said, just say *one* more thing, then it'll be clear and I'll be fine. Then I'll look at that and say again, ""no, just *one* more thing for real this time"", and on and on. I don't know if my continued efforts would be helpful or if it's just a symptom of trying to grasp onto control, and I keep going back and forth. I should put in more effort because we should strive to do our best. Or, I should let go of mistakes I may have made and just let it be."

The lockdowns didn’t really change anything for me. Recently found out my ex is talking with a guy and I’ve been trying to win her over since last year when she dumped me. We have a daughter together so I always see her. My routine is work, take care of daughter after work and most days then on Fridays like today, I don’t work and usually get my daughter Thursday night to Sunday afternoon/night. I’ve been working out and def am making progress, but no matter what I can’t feel better. I’ve no luck making friends so I want to learn to be happy by myself.

1,"Would you say that in 2020, it's never been harder to be a Stoic? It's true that with this sort of Stoic renaissance that's been going on since the 20th century we have access to a lot of Stoic texts (or modern interpretations) to learn from. But on the other hand, temptation is everywhere. Game, food, sex, social media, ect, these things are made into supernormal stimulus and prey on our most primitive urges. There are people who's job it is to blend human nature in their product to make them as addictive as possible. It's a science now, it's crazy (whether or not that's a bad thing is up for debate I suppose).

So my question is, am i doing correctly by not reacting and getting into a conflict of some sort? How would a stoic react?"

1,"Emotional abuse and stoicism Hi I’m new here, and to stoicism too, so I’m sorry if I don’t have a great grasp on the issue. But I read somewhere about how one of the things stoicism teaches you is to control your perception:
 “Choose not to be harmed and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed and you haven’t been.” – Marcus Aurelius
But how does that factor in with emotional abuse, especially gaslighting? 
If I look back at my last relationship, which was quite emotionally abusive, my ex would gaslight me and tell me that I’m too sensitive and that I hold the power to let his words hurt me- I could simply not care. 

I can’t seem to work out how what Marcus Aurelius says vs what my ex was saying.. was it really my fault? Should I have not been bothered by his hurtful words?

I think about it mostly in the context of determinism. But is there other scientific discoveries that have reenforced or debunked stoicism?

1,"My mother, multiple sclerosis, and coronavirus Hi all,

I thought about where I wanted to post this for a while and thought I'd defer to /r/Stoicism.

For years I have dealt with my mother's multiple sclerosis disease, slowing advancing and making her life harder, ultimately leading to a roller coaster of emotion where I'm told she will die due to complications.  One year it was a high fever.  Another it was she had a cough and her lung capacity was lowered, so she was at risk of not being able to breathe.  Yet another incident she had to have a surgery to put her under anesthesia and they were unsure if she would continue to breathe while put under.  I've felt her death come and go many times now (each time she survives), each time feeling like one of a thousand small cuts leading up to an inevitable conclusion.

This time I was informed she tested positive for coronavirus.  She is asymptomatic right now.  I'm trying to remain positive, but part of me knows this could be the final straw.  I've tried to think about what my future self would want my current self to do if things go awry.  Tell her I love her, record her voice, express gratitude for everything she did for me growing up.

Stoics deal with the idea of death frequently.  I'm not new to this idea, but it suddenly seems more real.  My question for you all is:

What can I do now, in this moment, that I will thank myself for doing in the future?

Thanks..."
1,What is Stoicism? The Philosophy For A Great Existence 
1,"I’m unsure whether to move interstate to live with my father or if I should stay. I wrote a similar post a while back. Though,  now I have a clear understanding of the pros and cons and that of benefits. 

At the moment, I live in Queensland, Australia. It’s basically north east of the country. I moved here after my parents split in 2016. I live with my siblings, my mother and her boyfriend. I live in a nice, friendly city. In fact it seems to give a good vibe - everybody says that. The weather is usually nice - although quite humid  all year round which is a great difficulty especially in summer. I have just graduated high school and have nice friendships: those whom I have been seeing since graduation (so far). 

Why, then, do I wish to move? 

I have many siblings, one being a baby, and the house is quite crowded and very noisy. My mums partner can often come down on me. Sometimes he expects too much of me. I do my chores daily but it’s never enough to him and always looks at what’s lacking. If I tell him what I do and ask why cannot he ask my other siblings to do those jobs that he finds incomplete (sister  16 and brother 13) he will spike up in rage. “Just do it and man up” well, I have been doing that. You cannot reason with him - not even my mother when she seldom finds the will to speak to him. In sum, he parents my siblings and I but more so me and picks on us for silly, unnecessary things. 

If I move interstate to live with my father in South Australia, I will be in a quiet, drama-free environment. This is the place where I grew up. While I like the city I live in now no doubt, I think I like this place slightly better and I do miss it.  That is he bonus. The consequence will be that I will miss my friends, and, I will be rejecting a direct Tafe (Technical and further education)
 entry in which I will study a counselling diploma. If I move it just means I have to reapply and I will most likely be studying online considering the distance of travel. 

I feel like, perhaps, it might be a little more beneficial to stay where I am. On the contrary I feel like I might be happier if I move. At least, there will be less dramas and headaches. 

I’m currently visiting my dad interstate - so I have a good decent idea of what it‘s like to live here. Yet, i am still struggling to decide and I must decide soon. I’m not so good at making decisions and I hesitate."
1,A Marcus Aurelius reference in the new game Cyberpunk 2077 
1,"This might sound crazy, but what is there to think about if you stop worrying about the thoughts out of your control? Hi everyone. I have had a serious anxiety issue all my life, and as I’m now trying to adopt stoicism and cease pointless worries about things out of my control, I’ve found myself unable to fill that void. And it leaves me drifting back to the pointless thoughts and worries.

It’s like, I can tell myself “OK, this thought is just another pointless worry, nothing more than a product of my anxiety.” And that can kill it for a few seconds, but then I actually can’t figure out what else to think about.

I’ve tried focusing on my senses, my responsibilities, friends and family, but I can’t figure out what to think about it all.

I know, I know. This sounds ridiculous and this is, like, a fundamental aspect of being human. But I don’t think it has been for me as someone who’s spent his whole life worrying about everything. Negative thoughts plague me, and in my efforts to replace them, all I’ve managed to do is curtail them for a few moments.

Does anyone have any words of advice or guidance?"

1,"Epitome of Stoic Ethics, Arius Didymus Started reading things outside of the big 3 and came across this in the FIRST PARAGRAPH.  


&gt;Those things exist, according to Zeno, which participate in the substance (A.K.A Nature). Of the things which exist, some are good, some are bad, and some are indifferent.   
&gt;  
&gt;These examples of good things: intelligence (Wisdom), self-restraint(Temperance), justice, bravery(Courage), and everything which is virtue or participates in virtue.   
&gt;  
&gt;These are the examples of bad things: stupidity(Obstinate or willful ignorance), lack of self-restraint(intemperance), injustice, cowardice and everything which is a vice or participates in vice. 

What caught my eye was the listing of ""anti-virtues"" which got me to thinking about what the ""Anti-Sage"" would be like. My best guess is that the AS would be the type of person you would least want to take advice from but who's advice seems most tempting. Being obstinate would keep you from having to reason about things so would be obviously the easier path, having intemperance would mean you never had to fight against your willpower to do things. You would simply do them with no thought to your character. Injustice would free you completely from having to worry about others. And cowardice would free you from risk.  It seems to me that for most people the ""Anti-Sage"" exists inside them with no effort, she/he is the voice that talks you into the next slice of cake or taking the tip off a waiters table after the dinner.  The actual sage has to be constructed mentally, she or he is ""built"" literally from teachings and virtue and requires effort. It was a small thing to fathom but it lead me to contemplate my own Sage and Anti-Sage and the internal debate between them. It helped me finally hang a name on what Pressfield called ""Resistance"" in the War of Art. This resistance is the Anti-Sage."

The hypothetical situation is a reality for many people, in fact there are videos that show such horrendous circumstances.

1,Stoicism in Dorian gray 
1,"Friend is telling me I ""haven't been acting stoic"" lately in regards to an issue with our roommate, but I think he fundamentally misunderstands stoicism. I introduced my friend to stoicism, offered to lend him my copies of Meditations, Letters from a Stoic, Epictetus' Discourses, etc. He's sort of into stoicism and I think he often watches YouTube videos about it; however, I don't think he's really diven very deep into it, and it honestly seems as if he's fundamentally misunderstanding it.

For example, we recently got a new roommate who has caused some issues (not cleaning up after himself, being extremely loud at 3 am, etc). I don't have an issue with the noise (can sleep through anything) but my friend does and complains to this roommate frequently. I don't necesarily have an issue with him not cleaning up after himself either, normally he does it in time - it just takes a pile of dishes for him to actually fix the problem. I solved the issue by keeping my cookware in my room.

The problem is that recently he has been telling us to clean dishes that I know for a fact were his own doing. This is a clear injustice in my eyes, how can you tell another man to pick up your own mess, and try to gas light them into believing it's their mess? Whenever he does this I immediately ""call him out"" on it. I don't make a big fuss over it, I just tell him that they're his dishes and his mess to clean. He normally responds by immediately breaking down and screaming. I raise my voice in return and don't yell, and just tell him to clean up his mess before exiting the converstion. He'll usually scream outside of my room a bit more and one time he even put the dishes in the garbage can, to which I responded by removing them and placing them back in the sink (they are not his dishes to throw away).

My friend has talked to me about this, and told me that I ""haven't been a stoic lately"". I haven't really responded, I just shrug because I geniunely believe my actions have been the correct way to respond to a situation like this. I think he misunderstands stoicism, and don't know if I should say something to him the next time he brings it up. From what I've learned, it is your duty to call out a clear injustice - in fact, not doing anything about it is letting your ego get the best of you, because you care more about being a people pleaser than you do about what is right. I geniunely do not care if this new roommate hates me, I just want him to understand the fault in his ways. Am I wrong to believe this?"
1,"How we find ambition... I enjoyed this video by Ryan Holiday. It makes me reflect on Seneca in his autumn years writing ""Letters from a Stoic.""  

Seneca is always a point of discussion because of his massive success (aside from quoting Epicurus often). Was he really Stoic in all his success? I believe he was. His success falls into the very category which makes Stoicism so Human. We ARE allowed to enjoy the result of living a good life so long as we are not attached to, or defined by it. 

Marcus discusses not needing ""the third thing."" We do good work, we feel good about the work. It should end there. We don't need rewards. Fame. Success. 

We get our ambition from doing a good thing because there is a good thing to be done. Not for fame and fortune. 

The culmination of doing good, doing right in a virtous manner, in the moment we are in will always lead to what we are here for: To be a good human being. 

The rest is nice, and we should enjoy it knowing it will be fine as fast as it comes. However it is not the reason for being ambitious, and driving to grow and be a better person. 

The better we become, the more we can do, and the further we can help others grow. Is there any other reason to do anything?

Stoicism has a way of sucking the life out of people at times. Especially when we reflect on how meaningless we are and how death is always at our doorstep. Add to that the fact we are not supposed to attach ourselves to anything outside our will, worry not about what is outside our control, and let's not forget we should not desire anything... What a bummer. 

So understanding ambition for a Stoic follower is important because there IS reason to carry on. There IS reason to do well, work hard, and be better. That reason lies in the work itself, because if we do not do it, who will?

1,"Meaning of EVERYTHING I have been thinking a lot about the meaning of life... and i have heard the stoic response, even thought if you would like, you could elaborate. 

Still i believe there is an even bigger question. 

What is the meaning of everything, the porpuse of everything. 

Do stoics believel the universe has no porpuse? And if so, do we have a porpuse? Ir does this means that life also doesnt have a porpuse?? 

And if the universe has a porpuse, what is it? 


If the answer is that the universe has no meaning and its all in vain, doesnt this question tear down the need for morality ir virtue?

1,"I got angry with a long friend of mine. Thoughts? So basically last weekend I was at a party with at a friend's house that lives far away from my home, and my friend had a car and lives very close to my place (we've been friends for more than 18 years, but 7 of them we haven't stayed in touch due to high school).

When it was around 2 AM I sent him a text saying that I wanted to get back from the party with him because if not I'd had to wait several hours until someone else decided to get back to their house.

He read the message, ignored it, didn't say a thing and left me to go and pick up his girlfriend at some other place (that also happens to be close to my house). In the end I had to wait until 7am until someone could drive me back.

Last night he came to my place (I didn't invite him), we smoked weed and then when we had time alone I told him ""What you did last weekend with me was really low"" and then he started giving the stupid excuses like ""I was drunk, my battery was really low"" bla bla and a attitude of ""it's not a big deal"" not to mention that he didn't apologize.

I know it's not in my control his reaction to what I told him and I don't regret what I've said, but I still feel mad at him. 

I just feel like he's a kid in so many ways and that pisses me off. I want to yell at him ""GROW THE F*CK UP""

I'm sure a lot of you have been in a similar situation before. How can I apply stoic philosophy to this situation?

1,"How to deal with other people's opinions? I can't seem to find the right balance. So in short, my job is in a non profit that works for the local government. We initiate all kinds of projects to stimulate sports participation, inclusion, help local sports clubs, etc.

This job is fun but very very politically loaded. Everyone seems to have an opinion on how to solve these complex problems and how tax money is best spent. 

I often try to tell myself that I cannot change the opinions of others. That I should just focus on the goal and regard opinions as noise. However, I keep having doubts about this.. Technically I CAN assert influence over opinions, right? And perhaps sometimes it's even a good thing to do? For example, when discussing matters with policy makers, advisory boards, etc...

1,"My parents never respected me Hi guys,

So I just wanted to get my thoughts out and I would like to know if there's anything I can do about my situation. I'm pretty new to stoicism and I would like to know what a stoic would do in my situation. I am a 20 year old and I have a bad living environment with my family. As I'm explaining this, I will do my best not to be biased to the situation that happened to make me write this. My family is nowhere near as terrible as some of the stories I hear on reddit. This post will probably only mention some of the bad things they did, but they are still decent people. Ever since I was little, my parents have always been extremely competitive. They would discipline me a lot as kid and that controlling nature only grew as I got older. They would beat me if I did something bad (which I understand) but they would occasionally just do things to take their anger out on me and give me slightly over the top beatings for minor things. For example, one time I playfully told my dad to get out of my room and he wasn't in the mood to hear it and he started to beat me. He had (still does) lots of anger issues. He told me ""are you the one paying rent?"" No apology from him for being stupid. There were several instances where they would beat me more to control me instead of just wanting to discipline me. I don't think  any of the beatings really made me mentally worse as I got older, I only saw my dad in a more distant way. As I got older the beatings became less but the punishments were still ridiculous. They would ground me for 30 days without any electronics every time I said a bad word in front of them. I stopped having conversations with my dad when I got to high school. I think my dad genuinely regrets some of the choices he made with me as a parent, but I can't be too certain. My mom is incredibly immature and narrow-minded. She acts innocent and probably genuinely believes she's innocent when she guilt trips me into doing anything she says. She claims that she wants whats best for me when she literally blackmailed me into doing what she wanted. She would offer me gifts and things like that but then threaten to take them away when I got bad grades or didn't do what she wanted. So I pretty much owned nothing. I threatened to run away and she said to go wearing a t shirt and shorts (which she bought) as a sign of her mercy. No food or water. She was probably thinking I would never do it anyway. She loves to monitor me over everything. I am 20 years old and I still share a phone with my mom. And we are not struggling financially either. My mom did not let me leave the house to go and hang out with friends growing up, She loved to control everything. I used to be very extraverted but now I just feel lonely. My brother was caught drunk in high school by my parents and he turned into a very rebellious person. He got angry at everyone and my parents didn't know what to do with him. I guess they became scared of making him mad so he turned out to be someone who got a lot of what he wanted. He joined the marines and he changed only a little but still is very easily angered. After seeing what drugs and alcohol did to my brother, they made me a prisoner at home and basically wanted me to forget about the real world and my friends. They used him as an excuse and because this happened early on in high school, I believed them relatively. Until recently when I got into college, I was able to leave the house every now and then. They would always check my breath when I got home for alcohol or weed. You would think that because I'm home most of my free time, they would let me enjoy myself every now and then with a movie or vide games, but every time my mom comes into my room and finds me not studying, she would yell at how I've always been lazy and unmotivated.  Unlike  everyone in my family, I am very laidback. I'd rather move on because this bullshit happens so much its yesterdays news and I literally forget about it the next day. But I don't think I forgave my dad. Not really. It could be because we don't talk more than necessary. I'm starting to think that my mom uses my passiveness to her advantage and tries to control me even more. I've practiced stoicism for a little bit but I find it very difficult to grow further in stoicism when presented in a living situation that always seems unfair. There is more potential to grow in stoicism but it's very hard sometimes for a beginner like me. I can't exactly move since I have no money and my parents wouldn't let me dorm in college. My question is how can I forgive people and how can I make my parents respect my wishes. Thank you very much if you read all this."
1,"How do you assess what is and what isn't in your control? This is a question that kept bugging me ever since I've first learned about stoicism and I've started reading Marcus.

It seems to me that in ancient world, knowing what was and what wasn't in your control at any given time was an easy puzzle to solve.

But nowadays technology gives us a continuous stream of ""optionality"". We are constantly innovating. Various things that used to not be in our control are now commonplace.

From Letters to Lucius 70

You think, I suppose, that it is now in order for me to cite some examples of great men. No, I shall cite rather the case of a boy. The story of the Spartan lad has been preserved: taken captive while still a stripling, he kept crying in his Doric dialect, “I will not be a slave!” and he made good his word; for the very first time he was ordered to perform a menial and degrading service, – and the command was to fetch a chamber-pot, – he dashed out his brains against the wall.[\[10\]](http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_77#cite_note-9) **15.** So near at hand is freedom, and is anyone still a slave? Would you not rather have your own son die thus than reach old age by weakly yielding? Why therefore are you distressed, when even a boy can die so bravely? Suppose that you refuse to follow him; you will be led. Take into your own control that which is now under the control of another. Will you not borrow that boy’s courage, and say: “I am no slave!”? Unhappy fellow, you are a slave to men, you are a slave to your business, you are a slave to life. For life, if courage to die be lacking, is slavery."

In a few months, I will be travelling abroad to get this highly specialised surgery done on me to hopefully relieve me of pain.

I find myself in constant anxiety atm. I find it difficult to focus on anything else. The feeling of hope that I might be cured is exciting, but I’ve had that feeling with other treatments before, and unfortunately been left burnt. The outcome of the surgery is completely up in the air.

The stoics talk of controlling your emotions, and not to worry about things out of your control. But I find this hard to put into practice. This is something out of my control. In a few months, I will be putting my life (or quality of life) in someone else’s hands."

1,"Natural Stoicism (Discussion)(Brainspill) How did you discover Stoicism and did you practice it unknowingly before you discovered it? I am curious about who is drawn towards Stoicism and why. I have noticed in my short life that men are definitely more prevalent in the community and I generally just have not met a woman that claimed to know of or practice (not that they do not exist outside the rock I live under). I am also curious if anyone else had a 'coming to stoicism' the way I did, almost unknowingly practicing/discovering the thought process.

As far as my time with Stoicism goes, it came to me very naturally. I do not know what triggered what I would always describe to people as ""An ultimate contentness"". I came to realize there was no objective good or bad in the universe nor any power out there able to invent good or bad. To plenty of people in my life and in the world, thinking that way is dangerous. My mother hates that I think abortion doesn't matter. It is not that it does not make me sad to dwell on, I just do not think that is 'evil' or 'bad'. This realization led me to that feeling of ultimate contentness. Yes, I still feel sad, happy, angry, but I feel more controlled about it and more optimistic about life. 

""but how do you feel happy if there is no good?""

Well that's just the thing, everything is SUBjectively good OR bad. As the human race grows in age and size we also collectively evolve as a society. Because of this we are able to learn together what is 'good' or 'bad' for a society in general. Not that this would or will ever work perfectly but I think it is pretty 'good' that rape is illegal where I live.

It made me far more angry than it should have. I mean it’s a subreddit, there are lots of others. But I feel like I want to do something to get back at the mod for banning me without even hearing me out.

1,"“All you need are these: the certainty of judgment in the present moment; action for the common good in the present moment; and an attitude of gratitude in the present moment for anything that comes your way.” — Marcus Aurelius  Do you see something repetitive? It is the word ‘present moment’. The Stoics believe we only live in the present and at first, I didn’t agree to much to them; now I do.

If you think, life is a lot of things but we only know for sure the ‘right now’. I do not know what my neighbour is doing, I speculate.

Let’s not worry about the future. When we meet it, if we have to, we will do just fine. I don’t mean, or better said the Stoics, to act badly because of… carpe diem. Actually, carpe diem doesn’t mean to think you are going to die tomorrow. It means: act accordingly as if you didn’t know if you were.

Furthermore, if we only have the now, we should then be: good to one another, thankful for not being yet dead for one of many traps and uncertainties of life, and use reason to live accordingly."

Therefore my question is if you have any recommendations of stoic books, magazines, articles etc. that use everyday English so I can get a better feeling for it and maybe read the ""normal“ stuff later on.

1,Is there any stoic perspective about regretting wastage of time From past 6 months I decided to prepare for an exam.but somehow I cannot able to do study.now I have constant thoughts of how I waste my time and ruminating in the past.how should I overcome that thought and focus in the present moment.
1,"My Best Friend Killed Himself Two Days Ago My friend was a father of 3, including a 1 year old and a 2.5 year old who will likely have no memories of their father. He had a great wife - super smart, loving, beautiful, and she had a great (and cool) job. My friend had a magnetic personality; people were attracted to him. He was calm, funny, polite, and a lot of fun. By all appearances - everything was OK.

Despite this, somehow, his priorities became so distorted that he lost perspective on ALL of this and something in his life tortured him so much that he threw all of that away. I don’t know what crept it’s way in and nested in his mind - there was a test he had attempted to pass and failed a few times and I knew it was bothering him. I still don’t know what the cause was or if he even left a note. It’s tragic no matter what but if it was over a goddamn stupid test........?!

I knew he was a little off and I didn’t say a lot. I didn’t want to embarrass him because we were in groups the last two times we hung out over the last two weeks. We took him out for his birthday Saturday night and I could tell he was off - he told me he was tired and I didn’t push, I wish I had.

We didn’t have a shallow relationship. As men, we didn’t talk often about feelings but it also wasn’t something we ignored either. We didn’t usually talk sports and weather. He was a thoughtful and smart guy. I could have probed deeper. I wish more than anything I had taken him aside, given him a hug, told him how much I support him and asked what’s really going on. I think he would have opened up if I asked. I’m not blaming myself, and it’s not about me, but this is a dark time for a lot of people. I had no idea he had ever even considered suicide. There was no cry for help or obvious signs...but there were subtle signs.

Please, reach out to your friends and family. Talk to them, love on them, hug them, ask questions, and listen. Be kind to people who aren’t friends and family, you don’t know what difference you might make.

I’m not sure how a stoic processes death of a loved one, it seems like the ultimate test and Im not prepared. I am still a novice. I’m not trying to suppress the grief I feel right now but I also will not let it control me. There is a small space between what I feel and what I choose to do. It isn’t incredibly wide but it is there. I am sure this isn’t the exact right view of stoicism but I am trying to apply it as best as I understand in the face of emotions I haven’t felt in a long time. I no longer get angry in traffic or lose my cool over stupid stuff thanks to stoicism but I don’t think that really prepared me for this.

I will learn from this. I am not sure where my life will lead but I know I will use this to help others. There is so much suffering and sadness in this world."
1,"Getting left behind by professional peers I'm 25. I had a rather terrible job until a few months back which I ended up quitting. This was when the pandemic was raging on in my country. While people might argue that it wasn't the smartest thing to do, I still stand by my decision since it gave me a much-needed break in my career. Now, I'm planning on applying to law-school\*\* and changing my field, something that I've wanted to do since I graduated (some 3 years back). 

Firstly, money is not an issue since attending law school is super-cheap in my country (admissions are based on an exam that I cleared with ease, since I really like the field). However, the thing is, law school is a three year, full time program here. Even before my earlier job, I had feelings of inadequacy with regards to my career. I was a lowly researcher working for peanuts, producing papers on obtuse topics that no one outside my field cared about. My peers from my undergrad were consultants, bankers - doing what seemed (to me) to be interesting work. I also felt some envy about the 'status' factor that these people had with such jobs - something that was well and truly absent in my own job.

Now if I do attend law school, that's three more years of being out of the job market. I'll 26 when classes start next year, meaning that I'll almost be 30 (!) when I graduate. My peers, who already have such great careers, will have left me in the dust by then.

My problem is as follows. Although I really do want to attend law school, and practice law as an advocate/solicitor, I'm rather uneasy about spending so many years away from the job-market, and in turn, being left-behind (professionally) by friends and acquaintances. When I was younger (in school and undergrad) I was a somewhat precocious kid - skipping grades, double majors, etc. so to be left behind seems like an extra scary prospect. What would be a healthy way of thinking about this? 

\*\*I should mention that unlike the USA (for instance), a law degree isn't really a big deal in my country (and not comparable to a 'fancy' degree like an MBA or something like that)."

1,"Stoicism for a Better Life - Weekly exercise (December 9, 2020) Hello there,

With the holiday season upon us, we are all adjusting to a new reality and new way of living. For many of us, it will be a holiday season without having the opportunity to see our loved ones. Then again, thanks to the advent of technology, we can still get some visual time with family and friends, and with the vaccines on the horizon, it is safe to assume we won’t have to go through isolation next year. So missing one year isn’t so bad, however, we can’t deny that this dystopian reality is still having an effect on people.

My government releases study after study on the increased use of recreational and prescription drugs, as well as the increase in sales of alcohol over the past 9 months. People are finding coping mechanisms. One such coping mechanism is shopping online. Although this may be to the benefit of Jeff Bezos’ overinflated pocketbook, I thought I would take the opportunity to share Seneca’s words of warning from almost two millennia ago, when he urges us to heed the perils of excess. This is from his work on Providence:

&gt;“If a man has always been protected from the wind by glass windows, if his feet have been kept warm by constant relays of poultices, if the temperature of his dining room has been maintained by hot air circulating under the floor and through the walls, he will be dangerously susceptible to a slight breeze. All excesses are injurious.”

Seneca went through ups and downs. At a certain point, he was one of the richest statesmen in the Roman empire, and at others, he was penniless and exiled (when he had to give up his enormous fortune to Nero in the year 62 - after Burrus died - to ...you know... keep his head attached to his neck). However, regardless of how much or little he had in his accounts and estate, he tried to never associate his happiness or sense of self virtue with his possessions. I specifically chose to use the word “tried” as he was (by his own admission) as fallible as the rest of us. But I digress…

A simple life is a happy life. Lest we forget that happiness can be found in living according to our nature, and although we are not as draconian as our older Cynic cousins, as Stoics we remind ourselves that luxuries, comforts and excess weaken the spirit and our resolve, and it also gets in the way of the virtue (i.e. working towards the betterment of humanity) that we pursue. Those of you who listen to my podcast will remember the example of my pillow (or lack thereof) when I sleep, and how this makes me more virtuous. You will also recall that I consistently speak up against self-deprivation, as self-deprivation does not make you more virtuous in and of itself.

The ultimate lesson here is that THINGS do not bring or take away from happiness. But buying things to distract ourselves and fill a void can cause harm. It causes harm to your pocketbook (debt can ruin a life), it causes harm to the sweatshop and child labourers and the workers jumping out of factory buildings into suicide nets, it causes harm to the planet as the more we buy the more things go into landfills, etc… Overconsumption, though touted by capitalism to be the only good, is an evil and categorically opposes the virtue we seek.

**So this week, when you’re browsing online as to what to buy, STOP. Objectively ask yourself if this purchase is necessary, or if it will make you or someone else more virtuous.** Have the courage to ask the question: **WIll this purchase make the world a better place** and have the strength to walk away from it if the answer is no.

I wish you a safe holiday season. We’re all in this together, and we’re all rooting for each other.

1,Word Whoever comes to a mirror to change himself has already changed. . .
1,"""Marcus does not offer us a means of achieving happiness, but only a means of resisting pain"" This is from the introduction of Gregory Hays' translation of *Meditations*. He describes the Stoicism of the *Meditations* as a ""fundamentally defensive philosophy.""

I used to be OBSESSED with *Meditations* a few years ago -- it was more or less my guidebook for living, and was a gateway to reading other works of Stoic philosophy. I have picked it up again to see how it resonates with me now. Meanwhile, I think Hays concisely put into words something I wasn't consciously aware of: what led me to distance myself from Stoicism was mainly that it centers solely around suppression without commenting on how to proceed once that has been accomplished. It imparts a sort of ""leveling"" of the human experience to the benefit self-control, but perhaps perceivably draining some color from the experience in the process.

Yet they lie beyond our control, mankind forever in their bind,

Solely steer yourself where you can, and to the path to peace you shall be aligned.

Like an encroaching fire, ahead looms life's suffering and toil,

Discard judgement's counsel, and in yourself — a source of strength you may always find."

I can't even get a drivers permit because of having no proof of address. I have a drivers license from the country I came from and law says I can use that for 30 days, but I couldn't get an insurance because I had no online bank account (they wouldn't accept the debit/credit card from my country).

I messed up and bought a pre-paid cellphone number because its cheaper, but it turns out I should of bought a legit cellphone number because they would put my address on the bill, which I could of used for proof of address.

This, along with me missing all my friends and my immediate family back home is causing me a great deal of stress throughout the day, especially when I'm not doing anything.

1,"Responsible concealed carry: how stoicism helps Hey all,
I don't usually post, but today I noticed an important way stoicism has helped me daily. I just recently turned 20, and living in Idaho, I can legally concealed carry a firearm anywhere in the state. I do this for self defense and to defend those around me. When carrying a firearm, you have to be especially careful with your temperament and be able to effectively defuse situations. Drawing my gun is something I hope I'll never have to do, and it's an absolute last resort. Stoicism has helped me stay calm in almost any situation, even just in everyday life. I used to let emotional distress take control of me when I was younger. Ever since I've taken on the stoic mindset, I have been calm and collected 100% of the time, no exceptions. I only started carrying a firearm recently and I think it's an absolute necessity to be calm at all times while doing so. Even without drawing it, if there's a heated (nonviolent) disagreement in public, it certainly isn't good to also be armed in case the police get involved.

Gun owners: understand that you must be calm at all times while armed. Stoicism is the way.

1,"Help a young aspiring stoic? College Dilemma I am currently 18 taking classes remotely due to COVID at a top tier University and I am paying almost nothing. Sounds like a great situation which is why I feel bad for HATING it. I was never studious and got in by the skin of my teeth after studying for the SATs for ever (at the time I found passion for biology and wanted to turn things around and get into a good school). But I have no passion and every career path through college I research just is boring to me.

At the same time I am super pumped about the prospects of becoming a Real Estate Agent. I am starting the licensure course right after I finish finals week and hope to begin that path soon. I also have interest in starting a small service business, as I have done so before but in a field I dislike. But interest for schooling that leads me nowhere I am excited about? Zilch.

I am maintaining decent grades but it is painful when I don't know what I want. I am certain I can get stellar grades if I were chasing a path I like, so I want to take a harmless gap year to explore my two options I discussed before. If I decide I do want to go to school instead, I could return with the same credits and fin aid package next year, no harm no foul, and I could actually go to school since COVID should be over by then, if thats what I choose to do.

I personally think this gap year idea is great, the problem is my PARENTS. They are open to my brothers doing whatever they want, trade school, etc, but when it comes to their eldest son, they want me to simply go to college no questions asked without regard for what I think. I believe it is because they are so excited I did well on the SATs and got into a good school, and want to continue gloating about their high-achieving and miserable little star student.

To make matters worse I am living in a goddam living room downstairs because I was ""supposed to leave for college"" as my brothers and even parents say to me. I saved 8k for them (they are paying for my college as of now which makes it even more complicated) by staying home since my college is tiny and has MASSIVE COVID restrictions which I want zero part of. My younger brother took over my room since I was going to leave for college and he routinely treats me like shit. In fact, everyone does sometimes.

I am certain that even if I go against their will and take a gap year I would be allowed to stay in this household for free, but even if I were booted I have a car, macbook worth 2k, bunch of other valuables, 4k in stocks, 2.5k cash, and I worst comes to worse I can live in my grandmother's free tiny house for free or rent cheap and work a part time job. Again I would seriously consider a return to the same school next year if things don't work out.

IDK, please somebody tell me if this idea is smart or dumb or whatnot. I am even a bit situationally depressed and need some light at the end of the tunnel..."
1,"Question  

One stoic aim is to regard externals without attachment and add nothing to externals, but one virtue is to provide love, compassion and kindness to others, as well as be a service to others. This seems a bit contradicting, can someone clarify for me please.

How does one care and love for someone as well as staying detached from them?

I am still new to stoicism."

1,"Confused about ""Nature of any kind thrives on forward progress"" passage Don't understand what he's getting at in this passage. Mainly the bolded portion.

“Nature of any kind thrives on forward progress. And progress for a rational mind means not accepting falsehood or uncertainty in its perceptions, making unselfish actions its only aim, seeking and shunning only the things it has control over, embracing what nature demands of it—the nature in which it participates, as the leaf’s nature does in the tree’s. **Except that the nature shared by the leaf is without consciousness or reason, and subject to impediments. Whereas that shared by human beings is without impediments, and rational, and just, since it allots to each and every thing an equal and proportionate share of time, being, purpose, action, chance.** Examine it closely. Not whether they’re identical point by point, but in the aggregate: this weighed against that.”

Excerpt From

Meditations

Marcus Aurelius"

1,"How to deal with toxic people! For example today, I was with some people laughing toxicly at anything someone do... and it was my turn to laugh at me for whatever reason, they make fun at me
but I could not apply what I learned from stoicism and this affected somewhat,

1,"Any advice for failing to be stoic in an extreme (for me) situation? Hi there, so I(19M) have been trying to apply stoicism for about a year now and I have been making good progress. With many things, my natural response has been very stoic, and I have been quite happy with my progress.

However, on Sunday (it’s Tuesday as I right this) I was admitted to hospital with a nasty infection in my leg. I am still here. The antibiotics didn’t have much of an effect at first and the doctors seemed confused, and I just lost it. I started thinking that I was going to die, or lose my leg, and have spent a lot of time crying recently, both from fear and from pain. This is obviously not very stoic of me. Now that my condition has been showing improvement I am much calmer and able to think logically about things, but am quite ashamed of myself for my initial response. I haven’t been allowed visitors due to COVID, so I have gone through this alone, which hasn’t helped. 

One thing that has come out of it is a reaffirmation of Memento Mori. I have genuinely (if irrationally) feared for my life since being admitted. Additionally, I have seen some very sick old people. In fact, the person that occupied my current bed (I was transferred to a different ward today) before me died today, and were wheeled past me on their way to the morgue. I feel sure that life will seem much sweeter and more meaningful once I get out of hospital.

I was just wondering if there’s a way to deal with feeling like you have let yourself down in your philosophy, as I have done in the past few days. I’m quite ashamed and embarrassed about it. Thanks in advance."

1,"Best Response To The Disappointment Of Life Author and speaker Jim Rohn on the best response to the disappointments of life:

""Let’s face it … people and events are going to continue to both hurt and disappoint you. Among the people will be those you most love, as well as those you least know. Seldom is it their intent to purposely hurt you, but rather, a variety of situations mostly beyond your control will cause them to act, speak, or think in ways which can have an adverse effect upon you, your present feelings and emotions, and the way your life upholds. It has been this way through six thousand years of recorded history, and your hurt or grief is not the first time a human has been deeply hurt by the inappropriate actions of another.

The only way to avoid being touched by life––the good as well as the bad––is to withdraw from society, and even then you will disappoint yourself, and your imagining about what is going on out there will haunt you and hurt you. Knowing this, there is but one solution that will support you when people and events hurt you, and that is to learn to work harder on your personal growth than anything else. Since you cannot control the weather, or the traffic, or the one you love, or your neighbors, or your boss, then you must learn to control you … the one whose response to the difficulties of life really counts.""

My Thoughts:

First time posting here, long time lurker.

This reference was cited in the Atomic Habits newsletter, from the author of the book by the same name.

Atomic Habits uses quite a few Stoic principles of analysing your actions, adjusting your perception of them adjusting them accordingly in order to develop better habits that support a more eudaemonic lifestyle that serves you and those around you better.

I felt this reference was interesting because it acknowledges that even though you only control your own actions, you can still disappoint yourself. The key is to how you deal with that and improve each time, so that next time you are a better person as a result of it."

1,"Is there an exhaustive list of Virtues? I've been exploring Stoicism since early this year (before Covid), and have come to understand that being a virtuous person is at the core of this philosophy. 

Wisdom, Courage, Justice an Temperance are 4 Virtues I see referred to as core Virtues. I've seen other Virtues recognized as well, kindness for example.

My question is, how are these Virtues selected? I heard one explaination claiming that Wisdom was the chief virtue, and all the others were derivatives of Wisdom. Christians, as myself, would claim that that which is aligned with the will of God is virtuous, and then many others have their own definition of what is Virtuous.

Everyone seems to have their own thoughts on what is virtuous. There seems to be no concensus. For that reason I must wonder, is a virtuous life up to the definition of the individual? I don't believe Virtue is subjective, but I don't understand how a concensus could resonanbly be met. 

I understand the question 'what is Virtuous' is an ages old question, and has been discussed at length by philosophers."
1,"Virtue and the Internet So a recurring theme in meditations and other stoic texts is that of virtue.  Virtue is the highest of goods; higher than pleasure.  Virtue lasts the tests of time and is the most worthwhile of endeavors.  This brings me to my inquiry.

&amp;#x200B;

What are some resources I can use on the internet to better be a man of virtue?  Things akin to being a crisis line volunteer (I still have to train for this), donating money to plant trees, or participating in political activism.  Any and all ideas are welcome as I wish to amass as many options as possible.

1,"The Manual I have just finished reading the Manual, by Epictetus. Translated by Sam Torode.

I have to say how wonderful of a book it is, with many fantastic teachings. A majority of the verses(chapters) are on average half a page long. Its really refreshing as someone who has a couple of mental health issues to read and ponder.

If you ever needed help with learning stoicism and applying or pondering in you life. Its a great option. My favorite verse is 10, page 14. The literal 1st line is helping me conquer alot of shame I've held onto for 15 years.

""Whenever a challenge arises, turn inward and ask what power you can exercise in this situation.""

It helped me to ponder what I needed to exercise. For this challenge only obviously. But it has helped me look inward when my mind begins to fight me.

I hope you find your inner harmony, this book is helping a lot. One verse at a time."
1,"Setting goals and shooting bows. When an archer shoots a target, there are three parts to that action.

First, the goal of hitting the target. It’s fully under the archer's control. He will set the intention (why I want to hit the target) and decide to perform the action.

Second, the action. Making the shot. Also fully under the archer’s control. He can do everything in his power to make the perfect shot - check the wind, prepare the bow, take the correct stand.

Third, it's the end. The reality of the arrow actually hitting the target. Here, the archer is no longer in control. Anything can happen - the wind can change, the bow can break. This is not under the archers’ control and thus not something he needs to spend any time thinking about.

The only two parts you control in the progress towards your goals are having the right intentions (setting the right goals) and performing the correct action in the best way you possibly can. The rest we leave up to the universe to figure out.

It’s not the results that count, for it never depends solely on us. It’s the intention one has when seeking the result and the action we take to get there.

1,"What’s the point of being benevolent when others don’t do the same? Life is like the game Survivor, in order to win, there has be a level of manipulation. In Meditations, Marcus Aurelius mentions that there are 3 kinds of people: 1.) who help someone and immediately look for reciprocity 2.) who are slower to look for something in return but who feel like the person owes them something 3.) who, like a vine which bears grapes each season, move from one good task to another without expecting anything in return. If we believe that we must be aware of the good we did and also make the person whom we helped aware of it, he believes we belong to the 1st category. Our duty is to be part of the 3rd category — help people without expecting anything in return.

However, what I have found practicing stoicism, is that you end up just being a good solider to the situation and end up getting all the work while other reap the benefit of complaining and getting no work. In a way, you end up being a pacifist. I also feel that you gotta remind people about your good deeds otherwise they go unnoticed. As the saying goes, the squeaky wheel gets the grease first. In politics, most decisions to get things passed is quid pro quo. I don’t know, is my worldview just dark?

However, sometimes it is hard to always know how to deal with a person or situation to alleviate future problems, (particularly how a team may view your decision).

They both said that nothing would happen, but a while ago they told me that they were going to date. I've been struggling a lot with this, and avoiding them has been hard since we all go to the same school. I broke it off with the both of them, so being around each other has been really uncomfortable, and neither of us thinks that we've done anything wrong. I need to be at peace for the next 6 months since we'll go our separate ways afterwards. I've been wanting to better myself, and be able to finish the last semester. As a guy that only recently found out about Stoicism, I would really appreciate hearing what more experienced people would recommend me doing in this situation. Thanks in advance. I will elaborate if needed :)"
1,"If you are depressed, anxious, suffer from insomnia, and any other mental health issue which requires immediate help, please talk to a counsellor or therapist. I know Stoicism can help you by a long shot but it requires practice and it's really more of a way of life. Mental health issues such as depression requires immediate action and different method such as CBT as it directly addresses the illness.

I know this for one thing because I am currently suffering now and while Stoicism principles are relatable personally, I feel it is not helping me. It's a high level form of help.

Talk to a person, preferably a person who is compassionate but would discipline you enough. I stay away from r/relationship_advice and similar subs as I think these subs are full of people who just wanna feel power over others (how they write their responses, in my opinion) which would just put you down further.

Stay strong and stoic (eventually)!"

1,"How do stoics handle making decisions that will affect their future to avoid future possible regrets? Maybe I'm explaining it wrong but take my main issue right now; I've made the choice to not have children because the cons out weigh the pros, I've had a hard life and it's only really been mine for 3 years. I'm slowly mentally getting better but there's no guarantee I'll be better enough to take on the responsibility of raising a child. I know that you dont have to give birth to he a mother, I know if I change my mind I can adopt. And my rough plan is that by the time I'm older, semi retired or retired I want to help children in the system and maybe adopt even. When I have done as much as I could with my life that I wanted and have the life knowledge that I feel I need to raise or help to raise a child. My friend is convinced that I am going to regret it and that I'm being selfish for saying I'm not going to. I'm not being selfish for living my life to the best of my ability. I don't think I'll ever be prepared for children until I am much older, if ever. I've been burned so many times. It would have to be a perfect turn of events for me to change my mind. I'd have to have be financially stable, have a career, a home, a partner. Don't know if and when I'll get even *one* of those things. I can only try and hope. 


So life changing decisions that you may or may not regret; how would a stoic approach it? I'm trying to learn more about living and thinking like a stoic would, it really speaks to me. But in cases like this, I'm unsure."

Ever since I purchased a fitness tracker, I've been more obsessed with the plethora of all fitness metrics the watch shows you.

I am now spending more and more hours comparing different products, its features, Pros, Cons, accuracy, tests, real-world scenarios, reliability, syncing with various other apps etc etc etc instead of doing the workouts. This device has not helped me improve my fitness but has increased my anxiety as I have spent a hell a lot of money and I am seeking ways to spend more than what I could afford and purchase a high-end tech. What is this insanity that you purchase a device to help you improve your life but rather you are presented with a new set of problems which are totally new and are unrelated.

1,"Memento Mori: A dream that terrified me more than it should have I don't remember how the dream started. I certainly don't remember every little detail, so if it appears as if i am taking a little bit of creative liberty, then i most likely am. 

The first thing i remember about the dream is the realisation that i have a token with the number 18 written on it. As i looked around, i saw that the room is a sort of waiting room with only a few other people in it. 

I could see one of my friends partying it up in a house across the street and remember thinking to myself, well she still has time. I thought this because her token no was about 47,000.

But what is the token no for, i think to myself and what place is this? I closely inspect the people sitting there and find out that almost all of the people there were really old with the only exception being me. I was a 20 year old sitting amongst septuagenarians &amp; octagenarians. Some of them were so old and weak that they were just waiting out their turn. But what were we all waiting for with tokens in our hands? It still didn't make sense to me.

Some time later on, a person came into the room and announced something. An old lady rose up from her seat and followed the person out of the room but before she left, she threw her token on the floor. Although i was surprised by this, i still looked at her token on the ground. It was no 13. I then looked around and found all the numbers leading upto no. 13. Like the number 11 in the corner. No 5 besides it. No 1 behind the leg of a chair.

I was still confused and was looking around but by this time, another person well into his nineties, started to stand up for his turn. He stared at me from across the room and whispered in his feeble voice, ""so young...so young"".

This is the point where it all clicked into place and i understood what was going on. I just froze in my seat with tears welling up in my eyes. After some time, i looked across at my friend still partying and drinking; doing the things she wanted to do because she had time.

But i had run out of time. Now, it was my turn to follow the person out of the room.  As i was following him, all i could think was there was so much to do and so much to see..."
1,Some Stoicism spotted in the wild. Probably not as poetic as the classics but it still highlights some Stoic themes 
1,"Paul Atreides and other stoic characters I've been reading Dune and there is this quote in the book that some characters say to calm their fear:

""I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total oliberation. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.""

When I feel nervous or scared I think in this quote and I realize that I cannot be fearless but I can control myself when that happen. I also think that having good examples of stoics persons/characters it's a good way to practice stoicism so I wanna know if there are other examples in books, films, series videogames or any other place you could recomend me.

1,"Anyone else having problems with the Daily Stoic store? Am I the only one here who has problems with the Daily Stoic store? I placed an order mid October for a medallion, still hasn't arrived, haven't received any email saying it got shipped either. Tried contacting the support about a week ago, tried messaging Ryan Holiday directly on IG, and no response yet so far. 

I figured things would probably take longer than expected because of covid and stuff, but... correct me if I'm being clueless, but I'm having a hard time believing months of silence can mean anything other than that I was basically forgotten or something. 

I'm not angry at Ryan, I'm sure there's a perfectly good reason for all this, and it's all just externals anyway, but I think I've been pretty patient thus far and deserve at least some kind of response... I did after all spend 44 dollars (live outside the US, shipping is almost as expensive as the item itself) two months ago and got nothing in return for it so far, not even a mail of apology or explanation, nothing... 

Very curious as to whether or not I'm the only one experiencing this problem or if others are in the same boat as me. Sorry if this post isn't appropriate for this subreddit, I have no idea where else to talk about this issue with other people. 

I don't want to assume any bad intentions on the part of the Daily Stoic, but I'm really wondering what an appropriate wait time for a response is, whether I've waited long enough or if I'm being impatient, etc. because their website mentions that most of their orders are shipped within 2 days (!). 

I decided to ask for a refund and to cancel my order because by the looks of it they never even shipped it as I never got a follow-up email saying that they did. 

All I'm met with so far is silence. Anyone else, or is this really just me facing these problems?"

I am trying to be more present with my own self other than getting overwhelmed thinking about someone else. I feel like I am investing too much energy in someone's life that I am not living my own life. I cannot explain that but I am never in my own self now. Even while writing this, I am thinking of someone else. Does that make me multi tasking into many things at the same time.

1,"""Whatever, it happens"" I saw a post on here recently about the Stoic Art of Shrugging.  Someone talked about how, after starting to practice stoicism, they started physically shrugging and using the shrug emoji ¯\\\\\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ more.  I think it can symbolize a lot of stuff - acceptance, contentment, wisdom, etc.  and an overarching understanding that things aren't always gonna go your way, but the best way to deal with it is to understand that and move on.  

To this, I would like to add the phrase ""it happens,"" which I've thought a lot about recently.  It's a saying that I've heard all of my life but never really thought about.  

You missed the bus?  It happens.

The water bill went up again this month?  It happens.

Someone did something to you that made you mad?  It happens, people aren't perfect.

It happens.  It happened.  It will happen again to you or someone else.

Most of the problems we face in our life are issues that have happened to others before.  That doesn't mean they don't still suck or that you aren't allowed to take time to deal with it, but you should remember that you're not alone in the world and many people have survived that same situation.  It happens, it's in the past, and now what you can do is decide how you will recover.  

This isn't an excuse to justify your bad behavior, ie. ""Why are you mad that I cheated?  It happens...""  But it is a way to take a step back from whatever you're facing currently and find some perspective.  Tunnel vision is real, especially in high-stress situations, but the sooner you're able to see the bigger picture the sooner you'll realize that maybe the world-ending problem of the moment isn't as big a deal as you thought.

1,"The Stoic Party...? I've long thought about going into politics but just can't see myself putting a R or D behind my name. I've even very seriously thought about running as a Libertarian as I feel most aligned with their platform but I'm just not sure they're taken very seriously. Sorry to any Libertarians out there, I vote Libertarian about 80% of the time but I'm still on the fence especially since many still view them as fridge or extreme. I mean Joe Exotic is arguably the most well know Libertarian in 2020, just sayin

I'm also a student of Stoicism and just finished *Lives of the Stoic*s by Ryan Holiday and Stephan Hansleman and it was enlightening how political most of them were, some even claiming public service is required to be a good Stoic. That got me thinking that we really need a Stoic Party. I know I'm not the first person to think this and even Found a short article on the same but the question still remains, why isn't there a Stoic Party?  It seems that the simple principles of Stoicism would provide a strong platform  and would be widely adopted in today's enviroment. 

Interested to hear your thoughts on this."
1,"Distinguishing Philosophical branches from cult-like ideologies? At what point does reliance and belief in ideologies become unhealthy? I understand that human psychology allows us to become completely enthralled in cult behaviors, closed to external criticism (giving us a sense of moral superiority in a way) and I was wondering how Stoicism allows us to not fall into that trap? I find myself happy within my beliefs and ideas about the purpose of life, the meaning of life etc but how can I ground myself and keep my relations with the world healthy? I don’t want to become too lost however I need to keep myself sane and content.
I’ve always heavily criticized religions and cults etc for not wanting to “face reality” about the pointlessness and sadness of life but now I’m worried that I will end up falling down the same delusional hole. Maybe I’ve got the complete wrong idea, but that’s why I’m here asking because I don’t know where being a stoic stands."

1,"Unintentionally Desiring What I don't Have I often find my self escaping mentally into a series of different dream worlds and what ifs, it's something I've done ever since I was young, probably started when I was about 9 or 10 if I had to guess. The problem I've noticed is that these worlds and scenarios are all filled with a focus on things which I do not have in the real the world and almost always completely ignore what I do have in the real world. Sometimes materiel things like new pieces of technology or sometimes non material things like a romantic relationship or fame. 

I've been trying to let go of these dream worlds since they have essentially become a safe haven for all of the jealousy and ungratefulness I've been trying to remove from my life however I've found great difficulty in doing this as its become almost like second nature.

Well I intend to continue training my self to stop this habit I wondered if perhaps others had come up against a similar problem and perhaps would have some words of advice for my situation. As of this moment my only real strategy has been to draw my self out of these fantasy worlds and consciously acknowledge that this was something and done and not something I want to continue doing, as well as not allowing myself to voluntarily and consciously slip into this state of fantasy, although it does sometimes still happen as I've mentioned its often become second nature when my mind begins to wonder."
1,"Losing time... our greatest vice  

**“I say, let no one rob me of a single day who isn’t going to make full return on the loss -** **Seneca“**

Would you give 1000 euros to a stranger? Just like that, for no apparent reason, would you? Or, if you had 86400 euros and lost 10, would you spend it all away in return of those 10?

No, you wouldn’t.

This is a metaphor for money and time. The first question introduces the topic of when we lose time for no apparent reason. We procrastinate all day instead of getting closer to our goals, our objectives; or even, we procrastinate all day to avoid having goals and by doing so, avoiding failure. That’s not only cowardliness as it is senseless.

Our time here is not short, we just waste most of it. Did you know that a normal person who has a regular job can, by the age of 60 have “professional” skill in 10 different activities, following the 10.000 h rule?

This means that by the age of 60 if haven’t done anything but work and procrastinating, you have lost 100.000 hours. Think of that number, 1 year has 8760 hours…

No one is about to become good at 10 different hobbies but think how much time we lose. Find something to follow. Become your master and don’t serve the bad habits of your emotions. Don’t suppress them but do your thinking.

Moreover, if someone says something bad about you, don’t let the whole day be changed by that person. Will you waste all of the time overthinking about a thing that is not of your responsibility? You simply cannot control what people say.

You can control if you care… Don’t.

Have a nice day."
1,"Hey fellas I'm new to this stuff, but as a child I had fairly severe anxiety. This sub among other things has helped me to cope with the past.  I have recently come out as trans and bisexual and learned to overcome the hatred of others, and now it cannot affect me.  It doesn't matter what others think.  The things that started me on this path was actually a couple months ago when I was playing skyrim with a friend.  He was talking to someone and that someone said. ""Just because it is, doesn't mean it must be"". And I was really taken aback because I hadn't experienced this type of thinking yet. My friend called him a stoic, I asked what that meant, and now here we are."

1,"The role of a judge in private law hey everyone! I'm currently a third year law student in The Netherlands, and one of my classes is Legal Philosophy. Each week we have to write a 400 word essay about a certain subject based on Epictetus's discourses. This week we have to write an essay on Dutch civil law from a Stoic perspective. More specifically the question this week is: write a stoic commentary on the role of the judge in the finding of law (the search and formulation of an answer to a concrete legal question with the help of sources of law (law, case law, common law, etc.), through systematic research of these legal sources in mutual context) in private law disputes. I'm having some trouble finding an answer and was wondering if anyone had any ideas on what the stoic perspective might be in this case, or what the stoicism says about the role of a judge in private law. Thanks in advance! 

p.s. the answer doesn't have to be based on Epictetus's discourses this week, but can also be based on Stoic perspectives and ideas in general."

1,"Don’t Wait To Be Productive Decades, years, months, weeks, days, hours, seconds. All of which are arbitrary time stamps we place on our perceived duration. “New Year New Me” could begin at any point in time and would render just as meaningless. Don’t put your productivity in that kind of box. That’s why most give up New Year resolutions by February. Cause they are tired of unpacking that box. Don’t wait till January 1st to do what you should be doing right now. Just do what you need to do. Physically, mentally, financially, spiritually... wherever you see fit. I don’t know any of you, or know what chaos is in your personal lives. But if it’s one thing we all have in common, it’s that we all have something to work on. You don’t have to wait to work on being the best that you can be. No matter what happens just remember to Love now, and to Breathe now."

So make the best of this test and don't ask why

It's not a question, but a lesson learned in time

It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right

1,"A family member of mine is in a tough spot. The person in question is old, sick (though sicker than most their age), and has little material wealth. Is living with their children which, while it has it's upsides, smacks of dependence.

It's got to be difficult and I've love some help pointing me towards particular passages that might be particularly relevant to someone in such a condition.

I don't intend to shove literature in their face, but rather just want to be able to empathize better and be better equipped to offer perspective should the opportunity arise."
1,"In a group of friends, what is the ""correct"" stoic response to one person spouting (nothing but) lies and negativities? As per the title, how would you react, when in a group of friends there is one person, who seems to have a need to limit their expression to 

* Denigrating others
* Tooting their own horn
* Spreading lies (think antivaxx, jews are behind everything, and you are an idiot if you don't get it), without being opposed. 

When bringing this up in private, I am being told just to ignore it, that's just the way they are, and focus on the positive.

In many ways, I am ignoring it, but the concern is that it has already deteriorated our level and quality of discourse. And while i am content in not engaging in these discussions, I feel there is real harm being done to my other friends."
1,how do I make peace with death? I know we all die but I dont want to accept that fact. I don't want to die. Is there any stoic way of dealing with this? Im not sure if this makes sense but I cant stomach this existential dread.
1,"What does Stoicism say about trying your absolutely best but still failing? I have been trying to self improve and read up on stoicism for the last past 3 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Im at the moment in a college education im super unsure about but i still try to do every assignment to the best of my abilites i dont want to just give up that is not a good habit to have i will try my best its all i can do.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway at this moment i am having the hardest written assignment i have ever done i have spent so much time and energy on this and today we compared our text with other students i hate that shitt i dont like comparing myself to others its not very stoic to do that. And yes my text was not very good and that makes me feel like a failure like i tried so hard but still its not enough how should i think at this moment is it even okay to fail? 

&amp;#x200B;

I have never ever been good at written exams but i still try my best. The problem is not writting its the specific system you have to write in and to be honest i suck at this i cant stand it i almost feel like it hinders creativity but to be honest that is university 101 hinder creativity and self growth just study for this piece of papper that said you studied i dont enjoy this system at all!

&amp;#x200B;

And i know at this moment i dont sound very stoic but a transformation takes time and at this moment i just feel really angry and exhausted."
1,"""It is characteristic of all deep human problems that they are not to be approached without some humor and some bewilderment."" Freeman Dyson "
1,"What does stoicism say about protecting yourself from further injustice? ""When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil"" (Meditations 2.1)

But what about narcissistic and toxic individuals that attack you regularly? Surely when seaking to establish healthy boundaries it isn't as simple as ""choose not to be harmed...and you haven't been"" (// 4.7)?

I think it is important to remember the above quotes for daily practice, but what does stoicism say about standing up for yourself, and establishing distance or healthy boundaries from people that are consistently harmful to your soul and wellbeing, whether they do so intentionally or not?

Quotes are most appreciated."
1,"Is there an empirical way to prove everything happens how it is supposed to happen? I am relatively new to stoicism, having only read Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, but one of the biggest draws I have to stoicism as a whole is the idea that everything happens for a reason, and exactly how it’s supposed to. It’s funny that I’m drawn to that, though, because I don’t really have a good reason for *why* everything happens how it’s supposed to. I know it’s a common idea in stoicism, but I’m not sure where to look for a good answer to go and why it makes sense. Can someone point me in the right direction or give me some insight?"

What's closer to nature's heart? Can you take a hot bath and

changed? 

Can't you see? It's just the same with you-and just as vital to nature.

1,"Stoic, heal thyself. It is so much easier to dole out the advice to let go of those things you cannot control than to do it oneself, but especially right now as I struggle with allowing a loved one to make mistakes or choose a poor mate. 

Myself, I tend to ruminate and overthink, and while in all other areas of my life I may often approach a sage-like zen with my circumstances, this is my Achilles Heel.

I feel a sadness tonight that is a physical pain. I hurt so much. The answer, I know, intellectually, but in practice, it seems so evasive."
1,"This is a Stoic discord with over 4000 members. They have weekly meetups, frequent voice chats, debates, book clubs and more. Thought I would share! "
1,"Opinions on Christ What are y’all’s opinions on Christ? The way I view it He is the perfect stoic. I think that forgiveness is an extension of not fretting over the things you can’t control. Even after His friend betrayed Him and had Him he was able to love him. Though I am not there yet I strive to be. 

So I ask again. How do you feel about Jesus’ teachings as an extension of stoic philosophy?"

1,"I really don't know if I'm stoic but I would like to learn about it Hi, I'm new here and the idea of stoicism is pretty interesting to me and I relate to it but I don't know much about it so it would be great if someone tells me what does the stoic lifestyle look like. Thank you :)"
1,"I used my stoic training today, and I am grateful for it. I know I will misquote this so hopefully someone knows the correct one. 

Marcus has an entry describing an event occurring not as unfortunate but fortunate that it has happened to you, as you were prepared for it. Example below.

My wife and just finished grocery shopping and got in line to checkout. The cashier we had was a new employee with a large “Trainee” sticker over her name tag. She was older woman in her 60’s at least. We could tell she had a hard life, and I assumed she must really need this job to have been a new employee in a job like this at her age. It was very crowded, and I live in a region where people are well known for being rude and unfriendly. I find this stereotype to be generally true unfortunately. 

There was one person in front of us, it was the shortest line by far. When we got up to her, she was clearly frazzled, in over her head, and furiously trying to make up lost time because of her errors which only caused more errors. She restarted our order several times as we pointed out mistakes that she was oblivious to as she was scanning items and keying in produce. At one point she keyed in a bag of loose apples as 1931lbs, I assume that it was the produce code for the apples. She restarted our order as she didn’t know how to fix it. It took her close to 35 mins to complete. Most customers behind us scoffed and changed lines. 

We were patient and kind with her. She apologized a few times. I ran the above stoic wisdom over in my head as it was happening. I began to think of all the impatient and unkind customers she will or have likely had. Or her leadership, which to my observance had virtually abandoned her. 

In the past I don’t know if I would have been as patient or as kind. I felt a mix of emotions afterward. Sadness for this lady who is likely having a very rough day, and gratitude for stoicism allowing me detach from my own inconvenience and treat this stranger with kindness and patience. 

I hope this comes across as introspective and not as virtue signaling, as that was not my intention."

1,"My recent fight with Covid Hello all, I just wanted to let you guys know that please mask up and refrain from large gatherings please. I recently contracted Covid last week and would like to share with you the feelings of nature that now have been lost from me for the foreseeable future. 

When we are born most of us are born with the standard five senses, smell, touch, taste, sight, hear. These senses enrich us with our surroundings and give us deeper feelings with nature. Last week I overcame my fever and chills but a symptom of Covid started to show, I then lost the ability to taste or smell anything, two out of my five senses were gone like that, 40% of my senses left me overnight.

Now I truly understand the pain of losing both these senses, I am not able to smell a fresh cup of coffee in the morning, freshly cut grass, the scent of your partner, or the taste of their lips. It’s as if I’m numb to Mother Nature and now I feel a longing for my senses to return, it truly is saddening once the reality sinks in that you will not be able to smell your favorite cologne or perfume, taste your favorite food, smell the wet asphalt after a rain for the foreseeable future. 

I implore you all to remain cautious and mask up please, this is one of the worst feelings I’ve ever had in my life. Thank you for taking the time to read this."

1,"Good stoic book to start off with for beginners? This question has probably been asked many times before so sorry not sorry!

But I want to read a stoic book after this, any suggestions?"
1,"Nice guy --&gt; tough guy So basically I have been having issues in regards to being perceived as a nice and friendly guy because 

1. I smile all the time and I cant help it.
2. I treat everyone equally and with respect 
3. I never get involved in conflict. Always been the one to give out positive and happy vibes 

 I think these are good qualities to have, but unfortunately these qualities can be misinterpreted as weakness and an opportunity to be taken advantage of. 

I have always been like this because I was taught from a very young age to be friendly and nice to everyone 

My whole life I have felt like I have never respected enough because of these weak qualities. I sort of get treated like how a person treats their servant. 

I Done being nice and friendly
I'm done smiling all the time
I dont want to be that person anymore
So here are my questions: 

1. Is it possible for someone who has been nice and friendly their whole life to change completely into someone who doesn't express emotion? (sort of like a tough guy kind of vibe) 

2). (If yes from question 1) what techniques or tricks can one use in order to make the transition? 

3) do you have any stories of yourself or anyone who has been in a similar situation that have completely changed themselves in terms of how they present themselves to others? 

If you read this I appreciate you!"

1,"What would a stoic do (in this situation)? Over time in quarantine, I befriended a person, and that person and I got along quite well. We had our arguments but we resolved them accordingly. Towards the end of this year, I was fortunate to befriend another individual. At first, both of them got along (almost). However, with time and situations, I somehow started to cause issues with each other (unknowingly). Each of them has an undertone of a problem that they ""dislike"" each other but never have shown while they speak to each other explicitly.   


I wasn't a very good friend to the first friend I had made, and I will be re-evaluating my friendship with that person as time goes on. Furthermore, the second friendship that I had made argues that the connection between the person themself and I should be demoted to just acquaintances because it's causing an issue with the first friend I had made, which is stupid because it isn't really...   


It is a triangular of friendship where I don't understand whom to be friends with and whom I don't. I have mentioned to both of them that I either stay friends with both of them, despite their relationship with each other, or none of them.   


I am not going to go into r/relationship_advice or anything. I just want to know how to approach this dissonant issue with the mind of a stoic. I live in a student accomodation building, and I will be leaving soon. I don't want to leave with any bad blood and wish to resolve this maturely... Stoically :)"

1,"Need help resolving anger towards repeated stupidity committed by my wife. So it's 4:23am for me right now. I have a final exam on quantum mechanics tomorrow, and I can't fall back to sleep because a fan in the bathroom fell down 2 hours ago. Why would a fan fall down you ask? Well, there's been smoke smell coming into the bathroom of our apartment. After trying everything to no avail, I decided to just seal the fan with duct tapes and it worked. The smoke smell stopped. But then my genius wife still kept turning on the sealed fan for the past few weeks, despite me telling her that it makes no sense. So tonight, once again, her stupidity culminated to waking me up the night before my super important exam. (After I was so very careful with my sleeping schedule for the past month or so no less.)

Well, maybe now you're thinking that it's probably not a big deal. People make mistakes...well, my wife here just could not understand how to keep the printer ink stocked no matter how many times I try to teach her, keeps locking herself out for 7 times in a row, drops her phone into the toilet and having to pay for repair multiple times...these examples are just the tip of the iceberg...would take too long to list all of her blunders...though some of them are actually kind of funny. Anyways, you get the gist. 

So right now I'm just like at the end of my rope here. Trying to act stoic and push down my anger. Still, it's just so very hard. This time I actually did not yell at her when it happened and calmly fixed the fan again. So there's progress, but seriously, thoughts of getting a divorce in the future still linger in my mind...Are there any stoic advice on something like this? I honestly could use some guidance on anger."

The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred mountain streams is that they keep below them. Thus they are able to reign over all the mountain streams. So the sage, wishing to be above men, putteth himself below them; wishing to be before them, he putteth himself behind them. Thus, though his place be above men, they do not feel his weight; though his place be before them, they do not count it an injury

It’s at those times when I ask myself why I am trying to hard to be virtuous. And I haven’t been able to ground a good answer. What does Stoicism have to say about this? Why should we strive to be virtuous?"
1,"Just a thought about stoicism The hybris to accept this condition called life and just to move according to nature is merely a disguise for our attempt to stand above all if this. Which eventually will be shattered through the mundane and we convince ourselfs to believe again.

Now I write in the journal, first-thing in the morning but obviously, I write about my life and revise Stoicisim, My emotions are all settled (though I need to work alot alot on mentality), My life is sorted, I 'm literally doing well, I feel like I have all the answer up till now in life. but I can't write or think like before or pour my emotions out, cause i don't dwell on it now, I just examine my problems and fix shit, cause now I got the tools.

1,5 Thoughtful Stoic Quotes on Death 
1,"Extreme Ownership Vs Stoicism I've been a firm believer of the extreme ownership mindset for most of my adult life and I'm intrigued to know other people's opinion on how this relates, balances and clashes with stoic teachings. 

IDEA 1: One should take responsibility for everything that happens in your life (no matter if it was you it fault or your assigned responsibility). 

IDEA 2: We only have control over the effort we extert into a task not the result of that task. We should try out best to live with virtue while knowing that the end results are not within out control. 

To me these two views seem to somewhat contradict each other with Idea 1 stating that you should bear the weight of all outcomes on the shoulders while Idea 2 stated that you should bear the weight of no outcomes, only the effort.

I have my own thoughts of how they reconcile but I would be interested to know other studying stoics' opinion too. 

Amor fati my brothers."
1,"Giving in to emotions or dealing with them? I've gone on an undertaking to fix the situation I've placed myself in. Occasionally I find myself overcome with emotions with the strong urge to cry. I've never, and will never, cry in public or around people. When I'm alone and struggling I cry all the fucking time. I don't know whether I'm dealing with my emotions by crying and letting it out, or if I'm being irrational and letting my emotions get the best of me. Remaining stoic I understand emotions come and go whimsically, but I find myself at a crossroads of whether I'm letting these emotions out or being weak by giving into them.

1,"""A sound mind can neither be bought nor borrowed. And if it were for sale, I doubt whether it would find a buyer. And yet unsound ones are being purchased every day."" I recently finished re-reading the Robin Campbell translation of Seneca's *Letters from a Stoic* and would like to share my thoughts on the following quote:

&gt;""A sound mind can neither be bought nor borrowed. And if it were for sale, I doubt whether it would find a buyer. And yet unsound ones are being purchased every day.""   
&gt;  
&gt;Letter XXVII. Seneca. Letters from a Stoic (Classics) (p. 75). Penguin Books Ltd. Kindle Edition.

I find this quote very relevant in the context of modern society. Wherever we turn, there is someone offering a quick fix for our lives. Whatever the problem, goal, or desire, someone is ready to sell us the solution. This could be how to advance your career, deal with anxiety or depression, find meaning in your relationships, optimize your productivity, lose weight, stop an addiction, etc . A lot of this advice is actually harmful and motivated by profit, yet we eat it up. Perhaps this is because it is easier than looking inward, being honest about our flaws, and then putting in the hard work to correct them. Cultivating a sound mind is not easy and no one can do it for us. Even if it were for sale, no one would buy it. This is because our values and aims are often so out of touch with the values that actually lead to a happy and contented life.

Don’t you see how much you have to offer—beyond excuses like “can’t”? And yet you still settle for less.”

I don’t want to be this way anymore.

Because, if I did, I would become a slave to anyone who can think; however, I don't want to be another problem someone has to deal with in their already problem-filled day. I try my best to be nice and friendly, but people still seem very uncomfortable when I'm around, and they very obviously don't like listening to me talk.

I’m already more grounded and doing more real life shit. Focusing on me :) I love it. I don’t even want to go back. I kept making excuses before about how useful and beneficial social  media can be. Well sure. But the negativity must be acknowledged and you should at least take periodic breaks! It’s awesome really. Just living. No bs. No fomo. I don’t care what everyone else is doing. It’s me time. And no I don’t need to show off. 
The goal was to do just this. Focus on what I want to accomplish without that intense distraction. Take away the temptation. Distance myself from what’s holding me back and detatch. Get more connected to real life. Nature. Get out in the world and experience what you’re longing too when you scroll socials. It’s working awesome so far. I’m excited to keep going too. I finally feel free from my past! - note I’m a 20 yr old male who’s been on socials non stop since 11. Plus video games.. movies, tv, porn. All that garbage that’s held me back. My best moments have been face to face connecting with people. Getting out of my comfort zone. Being very physically active, present and sober. (I should mention drug and alcohol abuse throughout high school) life has never been better even though I’m still struggling. More problems come daily that’s life. Best to face it and deal with it head on and committed.

1,"Meditations by Marcus Aurelius Changed My Life After having been aware of this book for a few years, I finally dove in for what was the most transformative two weeks of my life.

While reading, I completely shifted my approach and perspective to life, and began a journey to approach life with equanimity, learn to realize that I have complete control over my opinions and happiness, and vow to live each day virtuously. Despite making many other changes to my lifestyle, I believe that my adoption of stoicism has been the single greatest contributor to my current happiness. I can honestly say, that despite all the uncertainty and lost opportunities that the pandemic has brought on, I have never been happier, more content, and my stress and anxiety has virtually disappeared. Anxiety episodes and regularly occurring OCD feedback loops are a thing of the past. 

I really hope other people are able to have similar experiences. One quote from the second book that has really helped me to stay grounded: “Fame after life is no better than oblivion.""

This might be the most violated piece of commonsense wisdom in the world. Because what most of us do when something happens, goes wrong, or is inflicted on us is make it worse - first, by getting angry or getting aggrieved, and next, by flailing around before we have much in the way of a plan.
Today, give yourself of the most simple and doable of tasks: just don't make stuff worse. Whatever happens, don't add angry or negative emotions to the equation. Don't react for the sake of reacting. Leave it as it is. Stop digging. Then plan your way out."

1,"Ruminations about my current challenge - alienation of spousal affections I'm sure this is not an original post, as I am facing a thoroughly un-original problem. I've done my searching through previous threads, which has been helpful. I've also started reading and seriously thinking about Stoic teachings.

My facts: I am married to a spouse who is no longer physically attracted to me, although we share some social interests and are still cordial to each other. I have improved my health over the past year, and her affections have not rekindled. Absent physical intimacy, we are seeking therapy both as individuals and as a married couple. We agree so far that the prospects of reconciliation appear to be distant, and we do not understand why she has lost her interest in me. Without physical intimacy, I will not remain in the marriage and will pursue divorce, so that I may find another match who will be happier with me.

I am seeking ways to look upon this from a Stoic viewpoint, to remove the unhelpful emotions and to find the best solutions overall.

A few of my thoughts:

/1. Accept ephemerality of circumstances and also of my own emotional responses. 

It is difficult to put the personal negative responses - bitterness and anger - behind me, but this is nonetheless a worthwhile goal. Bitterness and anger do not help me deal with the situation, and they tend to only worsen the quality of the choices I make, and distract me from actual improvement. Yes, I can recognize that I am sad about the situation. Yes, I can accept that I am in some degree of pain. Now, I must choose how to act upon this input. Self-pity on the one hand, all the way to unrestrained anger to the other hand, are all equally useless in moving forward. Acknowledge the pain but seek to rise above it and return a stronger person.

/2. Take a larger view, from above (outside of my own head). 

Maybe I contributed to the problem myself. It is not clear what role I myself have played in the diminution of my wife's affections to me. I may have taken actions that made myself unattractive to her. It is worth the therapy to learn more about what actually happened, and in so knowing, ""know thyself"". Even if this marriage is irreparable, these lessons are worthwhile to better build future matches. Given the choice between blissful ignorance, vs. the knowledge to stop making the same mistakes repeatedly, which one would I choose? The choice is obvious.

/3. Practice poverty and misfortune.

Prepare for the worst case scenario so that I can accept it, if it does come to me. It is entirely possible that, despite our best efforts we cannot reconcile physically. This would mean that, despite our otherwise-positive relationship, a fundamental definition of our marriage is gone, and we can no longer be married.

If this does happen, it is not productive to dwell on recriminations. ""If I had tried..."" ""If she had tried..."" What's done is done and we need to move forward. Also, as a legalist outlook in today's modern world, this means taking care of the divorce procedures in a responsible and adult fashion (including virtuous conduct on both sides).

/4. Recognize what I can change and what I cannot change.

If my own conduct as a life partner was responsible for her alienation of affections, then it is in my power to change my conduct. (And it is not within her power to do so, so the problem and the solution both lie with me.)

If, however, it is an internal change specific to her, then some element of the solution will forever be outside of my own control. She may, or may not, resolve this in a way that reconciles us. I cannot control this and therefore I should not concern myself with this.

Also, as long as I behave virtuously and honestly to her, there will always be some element of her own happiness which lies beyond my direct control. I should not assume responsibility for her happiness. Years of doing so has not actually made her happy as a result.

/5. Memento Mori - remember that my days are limited.

If I end this relationship ranting and railing at Fate for my ""lost youth"" and ""throwing away my best days of my life"", does that help recapture the time? No. However, [I still have a decent number of days left in my life to work with](http://www.countmydays.com/). It is within my control to choose to leave this marriage and seek another match (hopefully armed with better self awareness so that I do not poison that relationship the way I may have done here). Yes, perhaps the loss of my bygone days is now beyond my control. But the thousands upon thousands of future days are entirely mine to apportion as I see fit.

/6. Distinguish between an indifferent external circumstance and a moral good or vice from my own reaction

It's possible that, even if I comport myself virtuously and generously, this may still end up in the dissolution of my marriage. This is not a failing, since the end result is beyond my control. I must work to not be distressed at setbacks and failures from circumstances. I must work to be master of my own responses, to treat my spouse with honor and honesty while we work through this difficult challenge. I must accept the possibility that her natural end state has no room for a husband like myself, but nevertheless to help her find the end state and be honest and true to herself.

What I can control is my reaction and my outlook. Do I seek to stand firm for my true self and hers, or will I cowardly bend myself out of fear of losing her (or aggressively force her to yield to satisfy my base selfish desire to possess her)? If she must depart, will I seek to give her a solid foundation to be happy on her own and to allow myself to be happy on my own? When she needs my input for her own quest to ""know herself"", can I give her support and assistance honestly without self-serving and self-interest?

/7. Discipline and repeated practice even when times are difficult.

Since I started reading Stoic thought, my mindset and mood have improved tremendously. Previously, my attitude towards my marriage was primarily betrayal (""years ago we thought our love would be one way, and now my wife has changed and our love is gone"") and bitterness (""she has done this to intentionally harm me and I wish to see her in distress for revenge""). Stoicism has allowed me to step back, to accept that the Universe and the people in it can change for seemingly-inadequate reasons (or indeed no apparent reason at all)... and that I can accept this without rancor, without impugning my own existence, and without needing to ascribe some malevolent motive to the person undergoing the change.

So far, Stoicism has provided me with many beneficial insights - perhaps because I was coming to it from a place of minimal perception, except for the perception of pain all around me.

However, it is possible that I may suffer bad days in future. Where the message of Stoicism is lost in emergent events or a rush of emotions. I have constructed a short daily routine of reading and thought (although I'm trying to get better about writing) and it is my plan to continue this even when the message of Stoicism is drowned out temporarily.

It is easy to adhere to a discipline when its fruits and bounties are numerous. When the discipline's fruits are more implicit, or when they require patience, then the true exercise of self-control comes through.

&gt; My pain is not unique. It is not even original.

&gt; To the uncountable millions passing by, my pain is of no consequence.

&gt; If they can set it aside so easily, then someday so can I."

1,"Should virtue be put on a pedestal? Let's use humility and Napoleon Bonaparte as an example.
  
In my study of Napoleon, I've realized that the man did not have much humility. He was capable of being nobel, wise, inspiring, and sometimes empathetic, but he rarely had humility. He always strived for power—for a good cause he would say. I'm not particularly dissecting the man himself, but the result of his actions. 
  
The first half of his career was glorious, creating a republic revolution throughout Europe and having all of its people question the aristocratic system. Eventually paving the way for democratic republic governments and abolishing the aristocracy. His lack of humility helped pave this way.
  
The last half of his career was devastating—resulting in catastrophic losses. Napoleon sold New France (which was almost half of America) to Spain to build a French navy fleet that was eventually obliterated by the British. And the horrific loss in the Russian campaign, which led to the loss of 500,000 men and ultimately the French republic. His lack of humility also paved this way.
  
I feel that if Napoleon was at least balanced in humility then things would have ended way better. But if he had too much humility then he wouldn't rise up in the ranks to push the French to become a republic. So my question is: Is it better to put virtues on a pedestal or should it just be a balance?"

1,"To Live I started a journal at the beginning of the year. I wanted write everything about my life. Anything that stayed in my mind I would write it down just so I could physically see it and maybe find a solution to it or just take it out of my mind.

On one occasion I started writing every problem I was going through at that time. Every Sunday I would find the time and write each problem I was having during that week. Maybe this will keep them off my mind a bit. As the weeks came by and past, I would read through what I had written from previous Sundays just before I write down the current week’s problems. I then started to unconsciously strike off the problems that no longer existed as I read through. 

To my discovery every problem I had listed over the weeks that still existed or crossed out made me look back with shock. Either those problems I resolved easily or they were plain worries that dissipated all on their own. Over a period of 44 weeks, I wrote down 138 different problems. Today, on the last month of the year none of those problems holds any weight on me. This does not mean that all of the problems disappeared no, even those that still persist today from over the weeks have not unfolded as ugly as I had perceived them in my mind. 

This led me to a simple calculation. Imagine on average how a human gets worried sick about 2 or 5 issues a week and gets to live 56/64/87 years. How many of these problems do carry weight on you? Now if I tell you to stop worrying, that will make you worried. You will worry not to be worried, or when will I stop worrying about the futility of life and the loop keeps going. Ultimately, we never stop worrying. Even as I crossed out previous problems and wrote new ones something always bothered the soul until it didn’t, and that is ok. That is because we are alive and life teaches us in our own ways how to adapt to our own situations, to move on, to live until we don’t."

1,"Tame Impala, Kevin Parker makes songs with underlying Stoic lyrics and/or principles I love them/him but only just came to realise the lyrics and titles are of ""embracing"" nature than ""fighting against"".

Before I begin, I understand songs are open to interpretation and you have your own subjective take on it. Here's mine:- 

&amp;#x200B;

**1)** Take [**Let It Happen**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFptt7Cargc) for example; the song title speaks for itself. 

The lyrics explains how fighting against something over and over again feels- hollow, empty. The more you fight against it, the more it's going to want to eat you up from the inside.

So just.... let it happen. Straightforward

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** This one goes under the radar because it's not on any album and was released as a single- [**Patience**](https://youtu.be/rUmV-MorIKc)

Look at his songwriting- it's transcendence, for me

*""Just growin' up in stages*  
*Livin' life in phases*  
*Another season changes*  
*And still my days are shapeless*"" 

Embrace all the seasons. 

People like the idea of reminiscent, I like it too and I'm no different.

However, it feels like people dislike what they are living at the moment.

Young people wants to be old and mature- or at least look old and mature.

Old people wants to be young again- youth that could never be returned. This is a sentiment I'm getting lately.

&amp;#x200B;

**3)** [**Nothing That Has Happened So Far Has Been Anything We Could Control**](https://youtu.be/VIVa7WEjXro)**.** This! This is the epitome of it.

It goes back to 1), the more you fight against the current, the deeper you'll be in despair. This song could also be his existential crisis tipping point:

""*Hey, what are you doing out here?*  
*You're thinking about everything, aren't you?*  
*I know it's crazy, but just don't think of it like that*  
*Nothing has to mean anything*"" 

This song could also be a breakup song as well: 

""*Lose the fight, yeah*  
*But it's alright*  
*It wasn't our decision*"" 

There's  a variety of interpretation here so just take it at its superficial level.

&amp;#x200B;

**4)** [**Sun's Coming Up**](https://youtu.be/HZmKam8AW0k)**.**

I took this comment from Genius, a prominent lyric interpreter.

""*I wasn't daring, not much a chancer*"" 

Most actions beset for Kevin are those that happen to come to him. Not much of a go-getter or an opportunist, he lives life as if it were a wave and continues it in a casual flow. This explanation of being a realist and letting life take it’s own path can be later seen in “Currents” in the first release [“Let It Happen”](https://genius.com/Tame-impala-let-it-happen-lyrics) 

&amp;#x200B;

**5)** My personal favorite, [**Alter Ego**](https://youtu.be/iErjaKTX_3w). Not just because of the tune but the depth of the songwriting. I couldn't even put in words what I feel about this, but he managed to write a song and produced it.

""*Get them to love you*  
*While they may, depending on your words and wealth*  
*The only one who's really judging you is yourself*  
*Nobody else*  
*Nobody else*"" 

It's introversion writing, where the lyrics are dialogue happening in his head, and then put in words. He lived in his own head producing album, Innerspeaker, to which I dare say it's one of the most intriguing songwritings I have ever come across with.

I could take everything too seriously by incorporating so many different meanings and ideas into the lyrics, when in fact, he didn't mean any of these. These are definitely the most interesting parts of music because it's open to interpretation and everyone's vary according to them, and that's okay for me."
1,"Around my parents, especially my father, I regress When I'm with my parents it's almost like I'm a child again, my father will make a relatively tame comment and I'll snap at him like an edgy emo teenager. I've been able to identify why I harbor anger towards him but now I need to figure out how to let it go before I damage our relationship further. 

I'm angry because he gave me some advice that blew up in my face. But I understand he was only trying to help, and the advice was based off of his own experiences. He could not have known our situation to be so different from what little I was communicating back then. The worst part is this was years ago.

I've come a long way in every other aspect of my life, I've made good and unemotional decisions because I've learned to pause and think before I respond or act but it just feels like when I'm around my parents like I'm acting out of pure instinct. I know that to not be true though, I believe I need to better prepare myself before going to see them and to be conscious of this issue while interacting with them until it is resolved. I can't just slip in to old habits just because I go back to an old environment. 

I'm an angry person in general, taking it out on others has been my greatest sin (I've never been physically violent, but I understand words can be just as painful). This is the one leak still left in the damn to the ocean that is my anger."

I advised against it but ultimately she went ahead with it... this time.

I know avoiding him isn't dealing with the issue but its hard for me to spend any time with him. 

It isn't as serious as a drugs or legal issue, just an overwhelming Bluto (Animal House) issue: ""Drunk, fat, and stupid is no way to go through life, son.""

1,"Being Stoic when things are going very well is just as important Ive found that a big part of being able to control my emotions and reactions to bad events is how I handle the happy/joyous ones. I find it easier to remind myself that good times are temporary which makes me cling to them less, it allows me to enjoy them in the moment for what they are without trying to keep myself in them longer than is possible or healthy, and prepares me for when they inevitably end.

It also, conceptually, builds inside of me the understanding that I often have little part to play in constructing the good events, and therefore the same with the bad ones.

Obviously good habits can engender good outcomes and vice versa but Ive found that if I focus on my behaviour TOO much, i find mysrlf wondering why bad things happen despite good behaviour. So i default back to nonengagement with those kinds of feelings and focus only on present action and present mind.

1,"Understanding grief: The Box &amp; Ball analogy I’ve noticed through scrolling the sub for the past few days, a lot of people are having trouble understanding how grief works. I wanted to share my favorite analogy, the box &amp; ball analogy. 

I’m going to try my best to describe this, hopefully this helps someone.

Imagine your life is a box. Inside this box, you have a ball. We will label this ball “grief.” Also inside the box we have a button. We will label this button “pain.”

When the event that causes grief first occurs, the “grief” ball is large, almost the size of the box itself. No matter what you do, practically just by living life, the ball will hit the “pain” button. And it will hit it over and over again due to the size of the ball.

As time passes the “grief” ball gets smaller. As it gets smaller, it is less likely to hit the “pain” button. But even after a long time passes, there is still a chance that the ball will hit the pain button, no matter how small the ball is. The button never changes, the pain will always hurt the same. And the ball never goes away, it just gets smaller. 

Eventually we must accept that this is the case. Our pain never goes away, it is just less likely to surface as time passes. What we can do is try to control our thoughts about the pain."

&amp;#x200B;

I was a nobody my freshman year of high school. This was due to me coming from a smaller middle school and not knowing the bulk of the school's population. My sophomore year came and I learned the social dynamics and just kind of naturally became friends with the popular kids, putting me in the popular ""group"". Parties, girls, drugs, and constant social stimulation dictated my life. I was living in the moment and hadn't thought much of the future. The end of the year comes and my middle school bully somehow finds his way into the group and publicly picks me on me to the point of me disliking my friends for not standing up for me (I was skinny and part of my bullied middle school experience was being physically hurt by this individual). My ego was shattered, as my top position in the stupid high school social hierarchy was falling apart in an embarrassing fashion.

So I win some random essay competition at the very end of my sophomore year that my English teacher made the class enter for a grade. I only did the work for the grade, so the fact that I somehow beat out whole school district surprised me and made me feel a little better about myself (I was completely isolated from everything at this point). The prize was a partially paid summer trip that I could choose from a number of locations- from cooking in Italy to sports in Brazil. I chose to go to Tanzania and live with some tribes because I really wanted some adventure.  The first time I was ever on my own I was drinking goat blood, living in a mud hut, dicking around with Maasai warriors, eventually living in a commune that was run by a Black Panther who had to flee the country, and shot a music video for one of the largest Swahili coasts' up and coming rappers after developing a relationship with his videographer.  That summer I also met a girl who coincidentally lived relatively close to me and fell in love for the first time. I was completely secure with myself for the first time in my entire life. I hold nothing but gratitude for the experience.

I unfortunately come back home when the trip is over after seriously contemplating burning my passport and running away to work on the commune (My role models and influences were free-spirited authors Hunter Thompson and Jack Kerouac). I learn the girl is extremely smart and we officially begin our relationship. My high school schedule for junior year has 6 AP classes on it (I think it was a mistake by whoever came up with it), so I go to the senior class's guidance new and unexperienced  counsellor (mine was out of town and very stubborn so I jumped at the opportunity here) and had her sign some papers that switched 5 of my classes to dual enrollment (classes at the local community college). I'm now in high school taking a full load of college classes on top of the 2 classes I had at my high school. I have **0** friends, and I was only with my girlfriend once or twice a week due to the commute.

I get a job at a movie theatre because of the night shifts' compilability (made up word but it works) with my schedule and form some loose but fun relationships with my co-workers. The biggest issue is that my bosses scheduled me for 39 hours weekly until I turn 18 and it jumped to 40, really causing my work to take up much of my ""awake time"". My schedule for the next 2 years of high school follows:

Wake up at 7am and head to first period  (had a first both years)

Leave high school and go to college, any time between classes I was pumping out work or studying

Finish studying and eat a meal around 3-4

Random things I had to get done 4-5

Work 6pm to 1-2 am depending on the day

Eat dinner between 1-2:30am.

Sleep by 3 at the latest.

I fucking loved all of it. I loved the grind, the exhaustion, and the fact that I was doing it for myself (this is literally the first time I've given an account of my life which is why it's likely sloppy). I just graduated last Spring, but skipped the graduation ceremony because I'm still a little salty about sophomore year and didn't want to risk my family to COVID. I'm still with my girlfriend, who will being going to an Ivy League school next year for international relations, (she was a year younger) which she chose all because of our experience in Tanzania.

My freshman and sophomore year grades were not great, and I didn't take the SAT seriously because I knew I would get into the school I've always aspired to because of the associates degree I gained right before I graduated high school. While I wish I could go off with my girlfriend at the Ivy, I understand I was a very different person at the time I made the grades that I did (just B's and a C in chemistry, but it's enough to knock you out of the admissions process). I'm currently at the top state school that only 4 others in my class of 320 got into, but I feel somewhat guilty because I got in on different merits while they worked their asses off academically. I shouldn't have been in this situation to begin with because it's so unorthodox. I *hated* school until I took my college classes and easily fell in love with academia. I walked into high school half assing everything and holding the intent to piss off my institutionalized teachers and graduated with admission to a great school. Nonetheless, it wouldn't have happened if I wasn't bullied some years ago.

*Back to the Modern Tense*

So I'm going to be 20 in September of next year. I'll have my bachelors in philosophy the spring after I turn. From there I'll decide whether or not I go to bud/s and fulfill my attempt of my childhood dream and become a SEAL, or obtain another bachelors degree in bio or perhaps push to law school. 

I want to be a lawyer

I want to be a biologist

I want to be a SEAL 

I want to work in politics

I want to open a restaurant

I want to be a philanthropist

I want to ditch the West and live with my Maasai brothers and sisters 

I want to be a professor 

I want to work to legalize psychedelics

I want to be a pilot 

I want to be a military commander

I want to be a doctor

I want to be a monk

I want to write

No matter the path I take, I will likely *want* to do what I'm doing. I see purpose everywhere. I see people spending their 20s in bars and clubs and one night stands, and while it's fun, it would lead me into a depression as I don't see purpose behind it. 

Because of my love and drive for work and virtue, I should be excited about entering this new period of ""adulthood"", as it would mean I have more of a capacity to do the work that *I* want to do. I could choose items off the list and them some to do, as I would not be having schoolwork dictating my life.

But 20 is scaring me. It's just a thin symbolic line in our perception of time that ultimately means nothing between the day I turn and the day before. But it is scaring me. I understand that this could get worse with each ""big"" birthday, and don't see that as a reason to ""unjustify"" my opinion. I'm ready to do all these great things, but I'm not at all ready to be 20.

1,"Stoicism for a Better Life - Weekly exercise (December 2, 2020) Hello there, 

For this week’s exercise, let look to Marcus Aurelius' wise words from his Meditations IV 7:

&gt;""Efface the opinion, *I am harmed*, and at once the feeling of being harmed disappears; efface the feeling, and the harm disappears at once.""  

An oldie but a goodie. We're going right back into the core of Stoicism with this one: All is opinion. There is no ""good"" or ""bad"" as far as externals are concerned, but thinking it makes it so. No one, no event...nothing can go inside your squishy bits you call your brain and make you think something is ""good"" or ""bad"". The decision and final judgment is ultimately up to you. It always has been and always will be.

This is why  two different people from different walks of life can look at the same thing (say a 2008 Toyota Corolla) and think two different things:

&gt;""What apiece of junk. I mean it works, but all my friends are driving shiny new cars. This is something a grandmother would drive. I hate it!""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Sweet I have a car! It works perfectly and I have heat in the winter, airconditioning in the summer and I can leave at my own schedule without waiting for the bus. I love it!""

It's all a matter of perspective and you have a choice over that perspective. **So as a practical exercise this week, when you feel harmed or are upset, identify the opinion...then remove it. It really is that simple.** Nothing in the universe is telling you to feel upset over the issue, and there are most certainly positives in it as well; you're just not looking for them. We tend to focus only on the negatives and compare our reality to a better and non-existent one. So when you are upset, just take a step back and remind yourself, you are the one making yourself upset...not the thing. And if you want freedom from this opinion, it is entirely in your power to do so.

Share your stories with me, I always love hearing about them and they help inspire others.

1,"My First basic duty as a human being ? When to give up on others?  

I have some people in my life which I really have/had respect for. but cause of our differences in the past we are not the same anymore, I found stoicism and they just became difficult. When I talk to them, they are just really really difficult to talk to, so much that it really pisses me off sometimes in the moment, yesterday night was the same, but now looking back. It doesn't look that much of deal, and after revising my stoic wisdom, I just feel pity torwards them.

I really can't understand this person at all, sometimes I think they are playing dumb with me coz I can't believe how on the earth someone (age21) can be this difficult and stupid to talk to, but i see, I don't blame them, after examing the situation I really pity them, I feel empathic and compassion torwards their solitude, though they are acting tough.

my old mentailty tells me to just give up, but my stoic self tells me to be the bigger person, be unharmed and charge in adversity with courage , and most important my First Basic Duty as human is to give comfort, relief and be kind to people. But they are just plain rude to me only attacking me(only words), they say they don't need anyone else and what not, they have changed in a major way. I know trying to change someone for the better, even though they don't want our help, or even don't see their problem is major, or worse don't even see us as a friend, is literally an impossible task i.e trying to control external things.

I know there is no right soultion for this thing, I can only have realtionship with my intents, but its like in the outer world, I look like a very ugly desperate person which is not helping the solution, I feel like I have wasted a lot of time and emotions on this thing which my future self won't be proud to look at past as seneca talked about once,

So what ? Should I just give up coz my intents are literally very impossible like, i really am starting to worry for myself/time, cause I have wasted it so much, Should I care about self respect too or should carry out my duty and be strong and help people. I dont wanna break into their life, and it also feels like im spending too much of life on them

1,"Discussing Stoic Practices The first book I wrote on Stoicism, in 2009 or something, reviewed all the psychological practices I could find in the ancient Stoic literature.  There were about 18 distinct psychological strategies, many of which could take the form of several different specific techniques.  So, in other words, there are *lots* of Stoic practices.  But very few of them are actually discussed in modern books and articles on the subject, for some reason.  We still hear people saying over and over ""So what do Stoics actually do?""  Stoicism was always known as very much a practice, though, not a bookish/theoretical philosophy.  It's philosophy as a way of life.

So which Stoic practices are most fundamental?  Well, I would say there are about six that really stand out above the others...

1. **The Dichotomy of Control**, or carefully distinguishing between your own voluntary actions and everything else, i.e., the events that befall you.  Arrian makes this the opening sentence of Epictetus' *Encheiridion*, the Stoic Handbook, for a reason.  It's also the topic of the first of *The Discourses*.  It's a foundational psychological practice of Stoicism as a way of life.
2. **Cognitive Distancing**, to borrow a term from modern psychology, or remembering that ""It's not things that upset us but rather our opinions about them"", by which the Stoics mean primarily those opinions that contain strong value judgments about external (to our volition) events.  This presupposes the practice above, actually, but it is also supposed to be developed into a continual ""tension"" of the mind, which the Stoics called *prosoche* (*seauton*) or paying attention to yourself, specifically to the use you make of your ruling faculty (*hegemonikon*), i.e., your value judgements and how those affect your feelings and desires.  We can also call this ""Stoic mindfulness"" therefore.  This is passage 5 of *The Encheiridion*.
3. **The View from Above**, as Hadot called it, by which we mean the attempt to broaden the scope of attention temporarily and spatially, in any number of ways, but typically by visualizing the world seen from above, like Zeus looking down from Mount Olympus, or, in fact, the view from the Athenian Acropolis looking down upon the Ancient Agora, or city centre.  It can also take the form of trying to imagine the whole of space and time, and our place within that context.  This is an important Stoic practice, as it brings together many elements of other practices, i.e., it necessarily forces us to contemplate the transience of material things and our own mortality.
4. **The Reserve Clause**, which is a technical term found in the Greek Stoic literature (*hupexhairesis*).  We're told all actions are undertaken by Stoics in accord with this principle, which acknowledges that the outcome is not directly ""up to us"" and would therefore be like adding the caveat ""Fate willing"" or ""God willing"" (i.e., *Deo Volente* or *Inshallah*) to every intention to undertake some action.
5. **Contemplation of Death**, which is implicit in the View from Above anyway but probably deserves to be considered separately.  Stoics are supposed to contemplate their own death every day, which Seneca does, for example, by telling himself each night as he's going to sleep that he may not wake up in the morning, so he makes his peace, and views the next day as a gift or, as Stoics say, ""on loan from Nature"".
6. **Contemplation of the Sage** (*Sophos*), or hypothetical perfect wise man or woman, which is a common Stoic practice although, paradoxically, they were known for denying that a perfect Sage had ever existed - even Zeno, the founder of Stoicism, is not considered to be perfect.  Nevertheless, the Sage is the individual equivalent of the idea of a Utopian ideal in society.  (Stoicism was founded on a Utopian text called Zeno's *Republic*, which described, ""as though in a dream"", a hypothetical community of ideal Sages.)   This is one of the three main sources of Stoic joy that Marcus Aurelius describes - we must learn to take enjoyment in contemplating what is genuinely good in life, i.e., wisdom and virtue.  The clue is in the name *philosophy*, meaning ""love of wisdom"".  We are to learn to cherish and contemplate the idea of wisdom and examples of it in other people.  Sometimes that means looking for traces or ""seeds"" of virtue even in those who are flawed.  Marcus Aurelius can be seen doing this in Book One of *The Meditations*, and he even describes the rationale for the technique he's using there later in the same text.

As mentioned above, there are many other Stoic techniques, some of which are also very important, but these are probably the ones that every novice Stoic should be learning and practicing on a daily basis, combined with study of the ancient texts, etc."

How do we identify the threshold between reasonable and excessive concern? As a point of order: I have severe OCD. It's a daily struggle for me, and has totally destabilized major areas of my life.

I've read some stoicism texts, listened to discussions and podcasts on in, etc. I understand the principles. I've also studied many of the adjacent philosophies (other classical philosophies, secular buddhism, etc). But one area that eludes me is that which I've asked in the title.

For example, I have an acquaintance I met through OCD therapy groups whose primary fear is hitting a pedestrian while driving their car. It consumes them, similarly to how my concerns consume me. How alert they are, how cautiously they drive, when and where they drive, etc are all areas in which they certainly are ""in control"", or at least to a degree in which modulating their behavior produces a change in the risk of their feared outcome.

Some concern is warranted, but at some point the balance tips into excessiveness. So what guidance does stoicism give to help us identify how to govern our concern over the things we do control?"

1,"Hope vs. Anticipation vs. Expectation Good day everyone!

I wanted to lay grounds for open discussion about three similar terms: **Hope, Anticipation, and Expectation**.

Here are the definitions of our terms, taken from [Lexico](https://www.lexico.com/) (an OUP and Dictionary.com collaborative site):

&gt;**Hope: A feeling of expectation and desire for a particular thing to happen.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Anticipation: The action of anticipating something; expectation or prediction.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Expectation: A strong belief that something will happen or be the case.**

At first glance, these three terms sound identical, with varying degrees of “expectation” as well as different modes (action as opposed to belief as opposed to a feeling). However, I was not satisfied with a singular point of view, and instead dug up other definitions from different perspectives.

# Anticipation vs. Expectation

* However, there is a clear connotative distinction between the two. ***Anticipation is looking forward with excitement to what is coming***, resting in the assurance that it will be good regardless of what form it takes. ***Expectation is projecting an imagined reality onto the future.*** ([source](https://archive.andsonsmagazine.com/23/anticipation-and-expectation#.X01hZmdKj6A))
* What’s the difference between anticipation and expectation?  ***The difference is in our attitude. One is hope and one is entitlement.*** Hope allows for any number of things to happen. Hope keeps us open to possibilities we couldn’t even imagine. Entitlement usually has a very specific outcome. It relies on other people to react and behave in the way we want them to. ([source](https://movation.wordpress.com/2012/09/17/anticipation-vs-expectation/)) \*\*They chucked in “hope” in this example, so please roll with it

# Expectation vs. Hope

* While ***expectation is the assumption that something is actually going to happen***, false or not, ***hope is the wish for something to happen.*** Hope is flexible. ([source](http://www.jeremystatton.com/expectation-hope))
* Having ***hope means you are trusting the process.*** Having an ***expectation means you are trusting the results.*** Having a ***hope means that the future is uncertain.*** Having an ***expectation means that you are predetermining the future.*** Having a hope is an action of humility. Having an expectation can be an act of pride. Having a hope does not disappoint. ***Having an expectation often falls short.*** ([source](https://www.thanemarcus.com/blog/2018/2/28/hope-vs-expectation-a-finer-line-than-you-might-think))

# Hope vs. Anticipation

* **As nouns the difference between hope and anticipation** is that **hope** is (uncountable) the belief or expectation that something wished for can or will happen... while **anticipation** is the act of anticipating, taking up, placing, or considering something beforehand, or before the proper time in natural order. ([source](https://wikidiff.com/hope/anticipation))

The above is by no means an exhaustive list, as I could have easily lost myself in differing opinions of “what is what” and “why it is such”. However, I did my best finding results that compared each term to each other (a lot of the results for Hope &amp; Anticipation were regarded as partner terms, especially within religion, and hardly defined either of them individually).

After reading through these, the three terms' definitions become more muddled. As such, questions can arise such as:

* Are hope and anticipation just sub-branches of the umbrella term expectation?
* Is hope a milder version of expectation and anticipation its fail-safe?
* Could one be all right in anticipating an outcome, yet have no expectations?
* Can one give up their expectations so as to not be affected by the result, but still hope for it? Etc., etc.

Let's say for example, you were driving on the freeway/highway/what have you. With the knowledge that there are bad drivers, would you anticipate them or expect them? Would one expecting bad drivers on the road anticipate them? Or because you are anticipating bad drivers, would you expect to see one zoom past you? Would you hope not to run into any?

So how does this tie-in with Stoicism? Many on this subreddit will know, passion is something all Stoics try to diminish or even eradicate from their lives. As a refresher, passion is defined as thus, taken from the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_stoicism.2C_considered_as_a_philosophy_of_life_in_modern_times.3F):

&gt;Passions (πάθος/pathological emotions) are emotions caused or reinforced by a belief that something not up to us is either good or bad; they are symptoms of mistaken beliefs about good and bad.

  
And here are some quotes from ancient Stoics about expectation:

&gt;“The result is, consequently, that ***when a man finds that some of his plans have turned out contrary to his expectations, he becomes impatient with men and things***, and on the slightest provocation becomes angry now with a person, now with his calling, now with his place of abode, now with his luck, now with himself.” - Seneca, (*Essays,* ON ANGER, III. vi. 4-vii. 2)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“***Seek not that the things that happen should happen as you wish***; but wish the things which happen to be as they are, and you will have a tranquil flow of life.” - Epictetus (*Enchiridion*, Section 8)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“\[…\] ***If you can embrace this without fear or expectation***—can find fulfillment in what you’re doing now, as Nature intended, and in superhuman truthfulness (every word, every utterance)—then your life will be happy. No one can prevent that.” - Marcus Aurelius (*Meditations,* Book 3, Chapter 12 \[Gregory Hays translation\])

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“When you show a cake to greedy persons, and swallow it all yourself, ***do you expect them*** not to snatch it from you?” - Epictetus (*Discourses*, Book 1, Chapter 18 \[George Long translation\])

From casual observation, a lot of negative emotions—and by extension, passions—stem from a thwarted expectation of a certain outcome to a situation. Would a person's reaction to the aftermath be different if he or she were to instead hope or anticipate? Or would the approach not matter?

Notwithstanding their perception of their emotions afterwards, could a Stoic successfully bypass this process by changing whether to hope, anticipate, or expect? Or none at all?

**This is not so much a question seeking a single answer as it is picking your brains and your take on hope vs. anticipation vs. expectation. I look forward to—or dare I say anticipate—everyone's thoughts.**"

1,"Is stoicism making me emotionally disconnected ?? I have been quite confused and conflicted about my practices and understanding of stoicism recently.

Allow me to explain my situation as briefly as possible : I'm a 15 year old and was introduced to stoicism last year. However no one I know practices it or knows about it, which is fine. I have noticed some differences that trying to apply stoic framework to my thinking have created between my reaction internally and externally to any situation as compared to my peers. Most recently example, my best friend (whom I love dearly and is like a brother to me) got diagnosed with covid. I was definitely surprised when I found out but I didn't panic immediately cuz me panicking doesn't make a difference, it's stupid right? BUT in my head I kept thinking if I should be panicking? Like I am 'supposed' to react to things in a certain way but when I don't, internally I feel like maybe something is wrong with me but I know there isn't but I just can't ever be sure!! 
I fear I may ""disconnect"" completely from my emotions?! I'm concerned and confused as hell.
I am having difficulty understanding why I second guess every thought in my head or why I fear what I fear or if that fear is even rational in any way. I am so cought up in how I should feel or.how I should react to what I feel, I don't even what I feel anymore.

What is stoicism's view on emotions? I feel this disconnect and genuinely scares me.

Will you have them amputated, and return to life in the gymnasium?' The man refused to submit to the indignity, however, and summoned the will to die.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Someone asked, 'Did he choose death as an athlete or as a philosopher?' 'As a man,' Epictetus said, 'one who had competed at the level of the Olympic Games, where he was a familiar figure, and a victor more than once - no occasional visitor to the local gym. Someone else might have even allowed his head to be removed, if his life could have been saved thereby. That's what I mean by having considerations for one's character. And it shows how weighty a factor it can be when it is allowed a regular role in one's deliberations.

Firstly, if the athlete could have nevertheless continued with his career (as per his brother proposal to return to the gymnasium), where is the drama here? The only explanation I found is in [this article](https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com/2016/04/05/epictetus-on-suicide-the-open-door-policy/), which claims that:

&gt;The \[dignity\] loss is greater, because it was believed that eunuchs could not perform well in the games due to side effects linked to their loss of genitals

Secondly, I don't really get is why Epictetus makes this sound like ""losing one's genitals is an indignity only for athletes"". I mean, wouldn't *any* man go trough similar pangs when confronted with this situation?"
1,"Regret is such a wonderful object for stoic humor Was just discussing a past choice of mine in another sub, thought some of the conclusions we came to could make a good exercise.

About 5 years ago, I worked with a guy who was a competitive bodybuilder - quite popular in the local scene and even trained with a few pros. I've always been into it as well, but at a very hobbyist level. 

One day at lunch we were talking about training and he mentioned that he thought I'd do well if I competed in physique (a division of bodybuilding that's geared towards a ""male model on the beach"" look, rather than the extremely muscular look found in open bodybuilding.) My reaction was just to say I wasn't cut out for it, wouldn't do well anyway, etc etc.

Thought back on the exchange earlier, and how I'd probably be further along in bodybuilding if I had instead answered ""never thought about it, can you help me get started?"" Well, I didn't and I'm not. 

Here's where I think we can get stoic about it: isn't it silly that I looked my friend - who by every measure knew far more about the subject than I - dead in the eye and essentially said "" you're wrong, I would know because I fuckin suck."" The combination of self loathing and wilful ignorance is absurd on its face! Let's consider that a lesson learned, and laugh at my nonsensical response rather than dread it."
1,"What did the stoics say about making large decisions? I am at a point now where I must choose one of two paths. One path involves finishing my bachelors degree, maybe interning a few times, and then pursuing a job in the aerospace engineering industry. The second involved entering ROTC, getting a masters, and pursuing a slot as an air force pilot, with the ultimate goal of becoming a test pilot.

It is not a small choice to make. My hesitation stems mainly from the freedoms you give up in the military as opposed to the jobs themselves. If I don't land a pilot slot its 4 years commitment, if I do, it is 10 years. The hope is that I love the job either way, but of course I can't be sure.

Stoicism has helped me in getting to where I am now. It has proved valuable to me thus far. But I'm not sure how the philosophy applies to huge decisions and uncertainties like this? Anyone know?"
1,"Females and relationships I broke up with my girlfriend recently as she said she wanted a break as she “lost feelings” she said she started doubting the relationship around mid-October so all within a month lost love. 

Makes me question if she loved me, she said she isn’t ready for a relationship but messaged her old “FWB” and is playing video games (PS4) with a new boy. 

She lied to me ( as we were playing PS4 yesterday) about talking to her “FWB” and said she was going off but appeared offline to play with a new boy. 

I disregarded the warning signs as she has a slutty post going into the relationship and non of her relationships last longer than 6 months. 

We decided to remain “friends” but I doubt we will rarely speak as she has another person to play with and she has completely lost feelings. 

What’s the best way not to care?"
1,"Even if you don’t remember the words of a book you read, you change subconsciously. Ive seen a few posts with people saying they can’t remember quotes, or what’s the point of reading when it all is forgotten.

This simply isn’t true.

Over the years I’ve read countless books on spirituality, stocism, discipline.

I can barely remember any specific lines from books.

However, everyone who knows me would testify to how much I have changed.

Each time you read something and gain a new perspective, you are subconsciously  changing.

Think about this:

Do you remember every single word your parents said to you, or lesson they taught?

Do you remember every single event of your childhood?

No?

But at the same time, much of who you are is the totality of those lessons, experiences, that your brain has processed and reasoned and it affected who you are today.

DO NOT be discouraged.

These principals are to be internalized, NOT memorized..."
1,I bought 2 books about Diogenes and Seneca. Any other recommendations I’m looking to read more besides mediations. Also what books should I read by Epictetus 
1,"Human life (Meditations book 2 XVII) Duration: momentary. Nature: changeable. Perception: dim. Condition of Body: decaying. Soul: spinning around. Fortune: unpredictable. Lasting Fame: uncertain. Sum Up: The body and its parts are a river, the soul a dream and mist, life is warfare and a journey far from home, lasting reputation is oblivion. Then what can guide us? Only philosophy. Which means making sure that the power within stays safe and free from assault, superior to pleasure and pain, doing nothing randomly or dishonestly and with imposture, not dependent on anyone else’s doing something or not doing it. And making sure that it accepts what happens and what it is dealt as coming from the same place it came from. And above all, that it accepts death in a cheerful spirit, as nothing but the dissolution of the elements from which each living thing is composed. If it doesn’t hurt the individual elements to change continually into one another, why are people afraid of all of them changing and separating? It’s a natural thing. And nothing natural is evil."
1,"Understanding Epictetus' burning down of the Capitol Excerpt from Epictetus' Discourses, Book I, Chapter 8 (emphasis mine):

&gt; You know, I once said the same thing to Musonius when he reproached me for not discovering the omission in a certain syllogism. **I said, 'It's not like I burned down the Capitol.' And he said, 'Idiot, the omission here is the Capitol.'**
&gt;
&gt; I mean, are these the only crimes, killing your father and burning down the Capitol? But to use one's impressions recklessly, carelessly and at random, to fail to analyse an argument as either valid proof or fallacy, and, in a word, to  fail to see in the act of question and answer what agrees with your position and what conflicts - is nothing wrong in all of that?

I suppose that Capitol is a name of a building on [The Capitoline Hill][1] in Ancient Rome, but I nonetheless struggle to understand Epictetus' message here.

Is it:

 1. A simile? Not observing that a premise is missing from a syllogism is as grave as burning down a city?
 2. A literal correlation? That omission from the syllogism was about the Capitol?
 3. If something else, what?

1,"Question about the theory of stoicism I had a school subject about stoicism and I really got into principles.

Now I have a question because I dont fully understand the concept behind it.

Would a stoic wise man help another person in danger? 

I mean, because of the ""divine providence"" (Hope I used the right word in english) you would not really care. Am I right? Whatever happens, is because ""God"" made it that way. So why even try?"

1,"On Starting Over: “You never really go back to square one.” For me, starting over was always on my “to-do list” yet I never would get around to it. Instead, I managed to find some reason why I shouldn’t. Every excuse boiled down to one thing; fear, specifically fear of change. 

Here’s the thing though, even when you start over, you never really go back to square one. It’s not a failure, it’s not a loss. If anything, it’s taking the wisdom you gained &amp; knowing what shortcomings and mistakes to leave behind.  

This leads to something that took a long time for myself to realize; your past isn’t all bad. It, for better &amp; worse, brought about this change in your life. As such, there’s some good in that! For me, it was learning to appreciate silence &amp; stillness, the importance of taking full use of the present moment, and learning to forgive others &amp; myself. 

If you haven’t already, I highly recommend reading [TheLoneStoic’s post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/k1lils/its_never_to_late_to_start_again/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) on making a fresh start. We all have control to change some things in our lives; don’t wait to change them. I wish you all the best &amp; leave with this quote from Seneca.  


“Putting things off is the biggest waste of life: it snatches away each day as it comes, and denies us the present by promising the future. The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today. You are arranging what lies in Fortune’s control, and abandoning what lies in yours. What are you looking at? To what goal are you straining? The whole future lies in uncertainty: live immediately.”  
- Seneca from On The Shortness of Life"
1,"Stoic way to deal with a childish roommate trying to harass me everyday. Hi everyone. This is my very first post here. English is my 2nd language so please forgive me for any grammar/logical mistake.

One month ago, I (F26) made a mistake to my roommate (24F) and since then she has been harassing me everyday as a revenge for that mistake. We are living in the same room. One night at 4am I left the bedroom door opened and the bathroom door opened while I was brushing my teeth. That made her woke up and immediately she slammed the bedroom door so hard that I think there's someone falling down the stair. I know that's my bad because I cannot go to sleep before 12pm. I've tried and it took me 2 - 3 hours to fall to sleep on my bed. The day after, she warn me that she would tell the landlord about my behaviour. And even though I apologized to her and moved all of my bottles for personal hygiene to the living room, to not make any noise when I go to sleep, she keeps taking a revenge on me by: (1) ignores my presence in the house, (2) always slams the door when get in and out the bedroom, slams every cubboard door when she saw me (3), try to making noise with her slippers at the morning as she wakes up before me.

The last straw was that last week, I get out of the bedroom after closing the door and didn't recognize the door was opened again (the door handle is ruined by being slammed too many times I think). I was still standing outside in front of the bedroom while she slammed the door so hard that I had a heart attack right behind my back. From that day I decided to move 90% of my belongings out of the bedroom to the living room. I couldn't have only one peaceful day staying in that bedroom.

Plus, we used to clean the house twice each week. And now I've always been the person who clean the house first in the week, and I saw her barely clean the house properly (next to doing nothing) after me. I planned to move out of this house in 1 month. But it still seems unbearable encountering her in this house.

Now, as I'm studying 8-12 hours/ day to finish my online courses, I don't want to waste my time arguing with her. I'm new to living in a shared house (less than 2 years), and so is she (less than 1 year). This situation (she taking a revenge on me) has not been happened once but 3 times, and I've been always the person who say sorry (even it's not my fault when I want to open the window (her side in the room) and she ignored me for 2 weeks) and break the ice to maintain the relationship.

TL'DR: My roommate has been taking a revenge on me in one month. How to stay calm and focus on my study?"

1,"Just sharing a portrait of Marcus Aurelius, hehe. "
1,"Leisure without study is death, a tomb for the living person. Seneca When I read this or some of the other things from the Stoics it always makes me wonder what they were like in everyday life.   Would they have been no fun to be around because they were never able to stop studying or working?   If they were around now would they stop to go to the park to play or pull out the PlayStation and play some COD with their kids?   Would any of them belong to a softball team or bowling league?

I guess my question is if you really tried to live like Seneca, Epictetus or Marcus would there be a place in your life for fun and down time?"

1,Went to Rome last year and stumbled upon this statue of Marcus Aurelius. 
1,"What do you think? Do you think that Socrates choice to die rather than escape was stoic? I have often imagined myself in Socrates' shoes. Will I also make Socrates' decision to die rather than escape?

I have read about Socrates death and the circumstances surrounding it a couple of times but lately, I have been listening to the performance for about the third or fourth time in an audio book version. This version Even further gives a clearer picture of the events that led to his decision to die. 

One of the soundest reasons Socrates gave for his decision was that he was right for the sake of obliging to the law.

But my concern is,- isn't it possible for the law to seem to support some vice? And in this case also, shall we oblige?

Or for example, if the law forbade Socrates to speak and live like he did, would he have also obliged?

These are some of my concerns, I'd appreciate any opinions."

Most of this ""dive"" came from an app called ""The Stoic"" and I read a bunch of quotes from there. I enjoyed alot of Marcus Aurelius quotes. After that I kinda lurked around here every once in a while.

So I guess my question is what are the core values and how do I put them into practice. Thanks :)"

I am not really writing this with any clear purpose just that wanted to share my thoughts. I’ve noticed that it is hard to achieve many of the stoic ideals and continue living by them.

1,"Wheaton College lecture of Stoic Philosophy - Focus on Metaphysics from a Christian POV Some features of the lecture include the Stoic conception of the soul and the order of the universe, Cleanthes' hymn to Zeus, Paul addressing the Athenians (both Epicureans and Stoics), Christian responses to the Stoic Logos and what they liked and disliked about it. 

Since it is a lecture addressed to a Christian audience it focuses on the more subtle and obscure aspects of Stoicism that most people ignore nowadays that appeal to people interested in Theology. So it's a good lecture to watch if you're interested in digging a little deeper than the popular quotes often repeated. It's a philosophy after all, interested in all aspects of human knowledge, not just journals or therapies, as good as they can be. It may not be a religion by the popular dictionary definition of religion, but it certainly influenced religion in the West.

1,"How do you go about changing your reactions to things? A pretty basic rule of Stoicism is that your happiness is determined by your reactions to external sources or even to your own uncontrollable internal thoughts. I fully understand this concept but I don't quite know how to apply it to achieve happiness in the face of adversity. What really gets me is the compulsion for me to do things by external sources that I don't feel like doing such as going to school or having to deal with uncomfortable situations. These are things that right now, I *have* to do at times. I'm not particularly bothered by the fact that I can't have everything that I want, nor do I really ever get jealous or longing for popularity or many material possessions. It's just the fact that I have to *do* things that slightly depresses me. I can't just be passive and fully enjoy life because of these things. Furthermore, and getting to my main point, I'm not exactly sure what my reactions should be to negative situations or thoughts. How can I be truly happy if I spend most of my time saying to myself 'this is a negative thing but I won't let it bother me'. That doesn't exactly seem like it would lead to happiness, just indifference, which is neither good nor bad. Sorry if this is hard to follow or explained badly. But if anyone could offer some advice for me then I would much appreciate it."

1,"Throwing away good and bad Marcus aerulius' work is actually really depressing to a lot of people reading it, because in his mind true stoicism means rejecting both good and bad. A lot of people come to this sub only in their worst moments, and a lot of people are drawn to stoicism in moments of despair. But stoicism isn't just a way to vanquish the bad, its a way to vanquish the good. Its about feeling apathetic to everything in life, or acknowledging that things have the power to make you happy or sad, but you have the power to not sort these categories into good or bad."

In psalms 94:3 it says 
“How long Lord will the wicked, how long will the wicked be jubilant?”
And sometimes we add “and the saintly will tear”

And it pretty much makes my point- it’s so hard to except that she(the ex) will just continue in life as “normal” telling everyone some false feminist stuff about how i hit her, told her what to do, suffocate her and get attention and mercy, and i will need to heal, be broken, alone and have all this hard stuff coming to me.

Im not here to get help, im good and i pretty much accept this reality- but the more hard part is about bigger stuff...how can i live peacefully when bad people destroy my beloved planet?

I go to the sea, respect the nature and animals, clean after myself and others and then go surf and get plastic and trash all over me, swimming in black sea water of pollution...

I can't seem to be able to put my finger on the meaning of it. If i had to guess it would be about procrastination and that one should get done with things as soon as possible, but i am really unsure. I especially find the part about 'today being too late' very confusing, since it doesn't seem to fit in with stoicism from what i know. Maybe someone can lend a helping hand?
Thanks :)"

1,"Can anyone help me understand this? I've been getting into Stoicism recently, and finished reading Marcus Aurelius's meditations as a starting point.

One key takeaway I got from it is to decouple my mind from Pain and Pleasure, these things aren't inherently good or bad but I shouldn't allow my mind/soul to be corrupted/afflicted by them and instead focus on directing my thoughts, words and actions to the ""common good"".

But what exactly is this common good. Lessening people's sufferings? Allowing people to experience more happiness? If we de-value pain and pleasure for ourselves, would it not be a contradiction to pursue the common good through these things? 

Are we supposed to only apply these ideology inwards while helping others achieve these same things we condemn?"
1,"Looking at those who had worries greater than yours help you be grateful and calm in times of stress Human perspective is relative. We see this in social media. People see fake people and may think everyone everyone is attractive. Yet when they step outside, the majority of people look average. Same with our problems. You probably heard of first world problems.

I recently found this online mueseum of the holodomor. It was basically a man made famine, technically a genocide, of ukranians under the soviet unions. Millions of people starved to death. The grain and food they had was forcibly taken away. People starved to death and their bodies were lying in the street.

Whenever my mom makes some food that isn't tasty, usually certain vegetables, I can't help but wonder how having a full plate of nutritious food itself is such a big thing. Especially when not having it for a couple days or few weeks will cease my very existence. It helps me ignore my taste buds, and be grateful for the essential things in life that I take granted for every day."
1,"Too much people mislead out here First I’d like to say that I absolutely don’t mean to be aggressive or angry or whatever, I’m not, I just want to express my point of view. I don’t pretend to be a « true stoic master lmao » either.

Every time I open this sub, I see posts where someone has an issue (anxiety, depression whatever) and the big question is « how do I apply Stoic philosophy to make the pain stops » 
Answer : you don’t 

You can’t just apply « stoic philosophy » to your life in ordre to feel better just like you would take a painkiller to make the pain stops. Stoic philosophy is NOT a short term option. 

In fact, you need to learn about the stoic ways, you need to embrace them, step by step, and make it a lifestyle, this is the only way you will get something out of it, either way it will be useless."
1,"How would a Stoic deal with sociopathy/psychopathy? Unfortunately, it is quite common for people to run into sociopathic or psychopathic individuals even when you are not aware of it. In the real world I believe that business leaders, managers, executives are commonly psychopathic or sociopathic and many of us have to deal with them on a regular basis either directly or indirectly in our jobs or even our living situations with landlords/rental managers.

Here are some sources for my assumption:

I myself am a business owner and I am almost positive I deal with sociopathy and psychopathy on a pretty regular basis with other managers/business owners. I am sure employees have at least one psychopath or sociopath on their establishment's management team. I am sure your landlord or rental manager(s) have at least at one point been socio or psychopathic to some degree.

I myself am also humbly new to reading about and trying to exercise stoicism, so I am reaching out to this community seeking those more learned than I on the matter. How would a Stoic deal with sociopathy and psychopathy in their own lives? Are perhaps Stoic ideals not effective when it comes to dealing with them as sociopathy and psychopathy I would argue are NOT in accordance with nature/virtue/reason/good."

I have depression, anxiety, and severe constant loneliness. The first two are diagnosed by a therapist, so I am not merely a depressed teen. I am an adult 21-year-old male. I tend to pine after romance, and all in all, I have been acting very anti-stoic. I want to change, but my fleshly desires are hindering me. I know it is in my power, but I am afraid I am too weak to survive. Please, lend me your wisdom. This emotional anguish is absolute hell, and I just want the pain to cease.

1,"New Years Resolution It is no surprise most new years resolutions fail. I think something we overlook is motivation. Chances are we can be a lot more motivated in the moment than we are later on.

I think small resolutions aren't bad, like (call my mom once a week, or eat less sugar, or eat out less) There is nothing wrong with things along those lines

I just think that you should live your life each day by principles, and see where that leads you, rather then setting yourself up in your head for a year, based on how you felt at that moment."
1,"Has anyone thought to radically apply the practice of stoicism? Pardon the rambling. I feel a compulsion to turn aside from the world's expectations and return to the roots of my humanity. I feel like walking a path of hundreds if not thousands of miles. Bringing my struggles with minimalism into focus, head on and radically developing my sense of appreciation for what I have left behind on my journey.

I don't know if anyone else has found themselves in struggles to break socially cultivated addictive behaviors prevalent in today, but I have. I find myself in good health with unique circumstances and facing a calling to walk into my natural environment and seek a territory that holds psychedelics in more legal esteem.

I recognize that this compulsion matches up with much of the stoic philosophy. Self-deprivation, testing what you can control vs cannot, gaining mastery over the mind and immunity to the influences of contemporary society. Etc. A brief and challenging separation from the heart of consumer society may do more to advance a stoic practice than anything. 

Has anyone else considered such a thing?

Tl:Dr we were once nomads, no longer, anyone ever seriously consider an extreme 500+ mile walk to extend their practice? Don't lie, I might ask you to go."

1,"How did you learn to deal with people ignoring you? How did you learn to let go of anger when someone is actively ignoring you or isn't listening to you?

I often find myself getting really angry with my parents and my friends when I visit them and try to have a conversation with them... only for them to ignore me or listen passively.

It's like talking to a wall and when I try to let them know what they're doing or how it makes me feels I'm suddenly the bad guy.

I've tried just stopping the conversation once I notice no one is listening or interested but somehow I'm still coming across as immature. I've tried waiting for someone to want to talk to me but then I'm told that I'm too quiet.

I just don't know what to do. 

TLDR: 

How do I stop wanting people to listen to me? How do I stop myself from wanting to talk to others just for the sake of talking? How do I find peace within myself and the silence?"
1,Top 6 Useful Seneca Stoic Quotes 
1,"Being afraid of the future is similar to trying to be a psychic or a medium I’ve come to the realization that it’s impossible to predict how a future outcome will actually take place. Even if a future fear that you have comes to fruition, if it is something that you have never experienced, it’s probably likely that it won’t be like what you imagined. So stop trying to predict the future, you aren’t a psyche.

This is a message to myself, but I figured maybe others would benefit."
1,Ambition means tying your well-being to what other people say or do This is from 6.51. of Meditations. What does Marcus Aurelius mean here exactly? What does ambition have anything to do with what other people say or do?
1,"Undifferent or depressed? My colleague at work is telling me that I look depressed because I am serious, indifferent and I don't laugh and make jokes with him. When he tells me that I look depressed it sounds really weird to me because I am not depressed. When he tells me a joke I just don't find it funny and I stay serious and indifferent. When he speaks I listen but don't speak back because I'm not interested in what he is saying. I feel like I will hurt him if I tell him that he is not interest of me. When I try to think about why I look depressed, nothing comes to my mind. I am not happy nor depressed, I am just indifferent. Is this normal for stoics or maybe I have some issue that my body is showing?"
1,"I was in car accident with someone (we're fine), feeling guilty. I had a car accident last week, 100% my fault. There was someone in the car with me, we were wearing our seatbelts and got checked and we're OK, just a bit sore.

I'm in good terms with my companion, we've been texting and checking up on each other. I still feel guilty I put her in that situation, which had I been more careful was completely avoidable. I can't imagine how I'd feel if she had been injured.

1,"Stoic advise on break-ups and specifically regret? I’ve been a growing practitioner of Stoicism for some time, it’s been waning in and out of my daily choices and I feel that I’ve ingrained certain aspects and not others. 

My girlfriend of 1.5 years and I broke up last night. It was definitely a little drawn out and we were able to separate amicably, on good terms. We both loved each other but unfortunately we just ended up not being fully compatible. 

I have a lot of regrets about the relationship. I know it’s not all my fault as she definitely had her issues as well. Specifically I’ve been looking back and just wishing that I had responded and acted differently. I wish that at certain points I had internalized Stoicism more so I got less angry, was more appreciative, less tense, etc. I know this is the best for the both of us, I can’t seem to shake the regret of not having acted differently throughout, not meeting her energy at certain points, and not just being as good as I know I could have been. 

Any Stoic advice on this? Break-ups and regret? 

Thank you"
1,"How does a Stoic perform self-control and achieve virtue through it? Hi, first of all.  


I often find myself struggling a lot with personal desires and often avoid work for school and important duties due to it. This mostly happens with things such as watching YoutTube videos or similar 'activities'.  
I do think that many find themselves in a position of thinking 'I'll watch just one more video and then work' and then never actually following up on it, at least I've heard so from friends.  
Ever since I discovered Stoicism I've become uncomfortably aware of this lack of control over my 'desires'. Currently, I'm reading Seneca (which is a wonderful book, by the way, I find it to be a lot easier than Meditations) and it has finally given me the last 'nudge' so to speak, but I still can't get a hold of myself. I've read the quote (which I only have in German and thus don't know how to quote it here 'xD) about lust being only temporary and virtue forever countless times and I'm in awe at the idea behind it, but still can't find the motivation to carry out these ideas in my day-to-day life.   
I found that this 'addiction' to social media, YouTube, etc. is probably the single most disruptive part of my life and since this is something fully in my control I really wish to change myself for the better.  
Being a member of this amazing community for a few months now and being inspired by it constantly I thought that I might find a bit of help here :)  


My question, therefore, is: How does a Stoic achieve the ability to control himself to achieve virtue?

1,"Maxims from François de La Rochefoucauld I recently read Collected Maxims and Other Reflections by François de La Rochefoucauld, and it such fun philosophy that jives well with the Stoics. Aphorisms are such a powerful and hilarious construct. I'm a huge collector of enlightening and good sentences.

Ralph Waldo Emerson said this: “Make your own Bible. Select and collect all the words and sentences that in all your readings have been to you like the blast of a trumpet.” This has reverberated in the caverns of my soul. I highly recommend doing so.

Honestly, I don't think anything makes me more giddy than a really simple and *good* sentence. Some examples down below--definitely get the book, it has more than 600 really great ones.


* “We are never as unhappy as we think, or as happy as we had hoped.”

* “We are never as fortunate or unfortunate as we imagine.”

* “How can we predict what we shall want in the future, since we do not know exactly what we want at the moment?”

* “You cannot answer for your courage when you have never been in danger.”

* “The inertia of laziness casts a secret spell over the soul, which suddenly halts our most zealous pursuits and our most stubbornly held resolutions. Finally, to give a true idea of this passion, it must be said that laziness is like a blissful state of the soul, which comforts it for all its losses, and which acts as a substitute for all good things.”

* “When you cannot find peace within yourself, it is useless to look for it elsewhere.”

* “We more readily set limits to our gratitude than to our hopes and desires.”

* “When we have the strength to admit our faults, that in itself should be some compensation for them.”

* “We should not be offended that other people hide the truth from us, since we so often hide it from ourselves.”

* “We readily criticize other people’s faults, but we rarely use them to correct our own.”

* “A true friend is the greatest of all possessions, and the one that we give least thought to acquiring.”

* “We are more able than willing; often we imagine that things are impossible because we want to excuse ourselves in our own eyes.”

* “However brilliant a deed may be, it should never be taken for a great one unless it results from great plans.”

* “Our minds are better employed bearing the misfortunes that do happen to us than anticipating those that could happen.”

* “Often what prevents us from giving ourselves up to a particular vice is the fact that we have a number of them.”

* “We forget our faults easily when they are known only to ourselves.”

* “There are people of whom we would never believe evil unless we saw it; but there are none in whom we should be surprised to see it.”

* “Someone who thinks he can find enough in himself to do without everyone else is greatly deceived; but someone who thinks that other people cannot do without him is still more deceived.”

* “Gratitude is like good faith in business. It keeps commerce going; we do not pay up because it is right for us to discharge our debt, but so that we can more easily find people who will lend to us.”

* “Few things are impossible in themselves; we lack the diligence to make them succeed, rather than the means.”

* “Men’s virtues have their season, as fruits do.”

* “Sometimes in life there are events that you need to be a little foolish to handle.”

* “If there are men whose absurd side has never been revealed, it is because no one has looked for it properly.”

* “Our wisdom is no less at the mercy of fortune than our possessions are.”

* “Circumstances reveal our nature to other people, and still more to ourselves.”

* “We ought to treat fortune like health: enjoy it when it is good, be patient when it is bad, and never use drastic remedies except in a case of absolute necessity.”

* “Nearly all of our faults are more forgivable than the means we use to hide them.”

* “We often think we are being constant in a time of misfortune when we are merely downcast and endure it without daring to face it, like cowards who let themselves be killed because they are afraid to defend themselves.”"
1,"“Love now. Breathe now.” That line is from the song Screenshot by Swans. I am putting it here because it struck me as very stoic and I had a realization that I thought I would share. But to preface, I highly recommend this song but it’s not for everyone. Swans is a very intense band. 

In the song that quote is yelled near the end during the climax as a sort of mantra. The music sonically gets very, very intense and “epic” if you will. Very heavy instruments and it speeds into a whirlwind of chaos. But it’s so juxtaposed with that lyric, “Love now. Breathe now.” 

That’s when I had a realization today, after listening to that song countless times. In life, it is vital to respond to situations in our life properly. We already know this. It can be hard. However while it is important to do this every day, it is especially important to do this when chaos is thrown our way. 

In my interpretation, to “Love Now...” is an outward projection to those around us. And to “...Breath Now” is an inward response to those situations and chaos. So no matter what happens, whatever situation you are in. Whatever chaos is thrown your way, Love now. Breathe now."

1,"How could I apply stoicism to this situation? Currently do to COVID, I work from home. My work involves repairing electronics and I use a work bench and soldering equipment and various odds and ends. I live with 5 others in a pretty large space and rent a room. I asked about moving my work bench into a corner in the living room that nobody uses for my repairs - which consist about 2 hours of my work a day and the rest are various other tasks like prep, customer service, research, and shipping that I would still do inside of my room as those do not require my tools or a separate work bench as the repairs do. I was met with gracious approval from 4 out of the 5 roommates, the fifth roommate who is also the lease holder and manages renting out all of the rooms was much more on the fence about it. He has been blowing me off about it with no concise answer to my ask and told me he wants to ask all the roommates about it when I already have citing that ""they're all agreeable people but might not actually want you to."" He also brought up the possibility of extra rent for a 15 sq ft space in the living room which I can kind of understand, however I also do find it offensive because I also have the worst room in the house and I pay the same rent as the other same sized ones and $200/mo less than for the one double the size of mine. 

This roommate has also blown me off for other issues in the past. We live in a multi-family home with a mom and teen underneath us. This teen was blasting music late at night and screaming at video games when I first moved in which I dealt with at first, and then I began to knock on their door constantly and asked this roommate if he can do anything about it but he kept putting it off. It wasn't until I called the police a few times that they finally stopped, but this roommate also threatened to kick me out if I called the police again.

As I'm writing this it's becoming a bit apparent to myself that moving out may the best option - but where I live is still a good deal for what I'm getting all things considered now that the noise issue was resolved. 

I'm wrote this situation down myself to try and determine what I'm more irritated by - the disapproval of my ask, or the way this roommate is handling my humble ask.

I came to the conclusion that I find his answer to be very self-righteous and offensive to myself and the other roommates (adults who are 25 and over) and it is pretty offensive to make value judgements on all of them by saying they're too ""agreeable"" to tell me no. It is not a big deal to me if I can't move my work bench out in the living room. I can carry on being cramped in my room and working that way or find another way to better utilize the space in my room or move to my own bigger space. 

Obviously now I want to tell this roommate my perspective on what I perceive as his unnecessary handling of my simple ask. But would a stoic do that? What would Marcus Aurelius do? Would he just stick to the facts when engaging?"

1,"What does Stoicism say about trusting oneself? I'm new to Stoicism and am curious if anyone can point me to some learnings that talk about trusting oneself. 

background is, I've been having a lot of anxiety that I've realized has to do with the fact that I don't trust/believe in myself that I am making the right decisions. Logically I know there is no reason for me to be anxious; I know logically that I am making the right decisions based on the information that I have available and that I spend too much time looking ahead rather than being in the present moment. I tend to not be in the present moment and so I get caught up in thinking about the ""logistics of the future"", not even daydreaming about possibilities, but just mapping out in my mind all the little things that I need to do to achieve something. for example, thinking about moving to a new apartment, I'll be up at night not being able to sleep because I'm thinking about where each furniture item will go and which new items I need to purchase to outfit my apartment. 

I want to be able to get away from this thinking because it's taking up so much mind space and not allowing me to be in the present and be grateful for what I do have, and to be able to trust myself and appreciate how far I've come. any tips? thanks!!!"
1,I feel as if this quote is unintentionally very stoic 
1,"Going through a divorce/custody battle - having a hard time dealing with the grief, the anger, the betrayal My soon to be ex husband and I have been best friends since we were 14. We got together 8 years ago, we got married, we had two kids. There were many ups and downs. And come July this year, we decided to a trial separation. I felt we just needed a break of sorts. To maybe get our shit together, with the goal of getting back together, better than ever. He agreed. And then things sort of went south. We hurt each other with words and actions. I kept trying to fix it. I wanted to go to therapy. I really tried to work on things. He didn’t. He decided he was done and he’s given up. I feel hurt, lost, like my best friend has died. He’s changed a lot and idk who this new person is. He’s being really cold, harsh, selfish. We’ve been going to coparenting therapy, and I thought things were getting better and then I found out that he was sleeping with our neighbor/my friend. They both lied to me about it. Their reasoning was that it’s their lives and they’re adults. My husbands reasoning was that he spent too long caring about my feelings and hes done doing that. 

Aside from all of that, I have been a stay at home mom for 6 years. We’d agreed on that until the kids went to school. So, I don’t have much and I’m literally rebuilding from the bottom now. Which is okay, but he’s making things worse. We’re now going to court and things have gotten nasty. We can’t seem to agree. In some ways I feel like he’s trying to hurt/punish me and I’m not really sure why. 

I feel depleted and betrayed. I feel alone, incredibly hurt, stressed. 

I guess my question is... what would a stoic do, in this scenario? Feeling these ways. Constant hurt and stress. Feeling beat down, between a rock and a hard place. Having to share children with someone that seems like they hate you. Idk what to do. I can’t stop thinking about it all. I feel like I need different perspectives"

1,"How can I deal with past regrets or mistakes (according to stoicism)? A couple of years ago, I made the worst mistake of my whole life!
I chose the wrong (study) path for myself!

I chose the wrong field of study and I went to college for that. It was my 2nd option (and still science-related) and I thought I liked it before college, but after a year in, I realized I did not like it, and it wasn't what I thought it would be. And it did not have the future and work environment that I wanted.

I wanted to quit and retry many times, but my family told me not to do that, as it is/was a good major, and I accepted.

All those years was like hell for me and I tried to let go of that hate. I finally graduated and the regret and guilt came back again. I still can't stop blaming myself for that and I still have nightmares about that.

I wish I had tried more to get into my first option. I didn't care about it much back then, but now I do. It suits my personality and my expectations. I keep thinking about past alternatives in which I made right choices and it just makes me feel worse, knowing I can't get back it time to fix it and to convince myself to make the right choice.

I can't retry and get into my favorite (and more suitable) field. I mean, I'm in my mid 20s and I have to be in a class with students much younger than me, which would be weird (to me)!

How to get over past regrets and the continuous guilt, envy, shame and depression that comes with it? 

Thanks."
1,"Help me overcome my young sister's suicide 4 months ago my young sister killed herself. Our family dynamics, placed me in a position of a proud, and influencing older brother. I put a lot of effort in to giving my time to provide fortuity to my young siblings.

Since her death, I have been plagued with realisation, and fear, of death. I instantaneously feel life is SO short. 

I have followed this sub for a long while, and as a rationalist, I seek to take life one step at a time, and overcome many things, to accept what I can, and cannot do in my short existence. 

However, now, on a daily basis, I fear death. I fear I am rapidly aging (31), and I am past my peak, and I keep trying to convince myself to stop thinking about the totality of life and that I will indeed, one day, die. It feels rather close (meaning old age). I feel like I wont have enough time for everything - a family, career etc. 

I think I can accept her death, but I am struggling to come to terms with my position in life. We grow up with a grandiosity of what we will achieve; my mind flashes back to such happy times when I was a kid, but with so many close deaths in my small family, and the dissolution of my family wellbeing, I know that contented dream is kinda faded. 

Do you guys fear death? How do you overcome your knowledge of your guaranteed death? How can we feel content knowing our time is limited? Age old questions, but only questions which have become ultra real as a result of my circumstance. My world-perspective has been truly rocked. How can I wake, and go to sleep, without feeling my death is too imminent?

Side note. I am coping well, I continue to succeed, mostly, in my responsibilities and my goals. I don't visibly grieve, except in my dreams, where I scream, and I cry. I don't do this in the waking world. 

Cheers, brothers &amp; sisters.

PS. In suicide, you escape, but the hard truth is, those around you do not. I have felt suicidal in life (not so much in the past year, yay, and especially not now), but now I truly understand death, I think. You just don't get another go. You cease to exist. Bam. Done. No more thoughts. But your loved ones live on, and they grieve. They will never be quite the same. Please don't do it. PM me if you want to unload - I will listen as a stranger."
1,"How do I conquer the fear of intense physical pain? After reading, re-reading, internalizing and practicing, I have come to the conclusion that I only have one true fear in life. This is the fear of experiencing intense physical pain. The worst physical pain I have experienced is fracturing my foot, but I personally would deem this to be mild physical pain.

I’m not afraid of death. What I am afraid of is the intense physical pain that would come in the process of a slow and gruesome death.

I guess a more mild example would be having my leg cut off. I’m not afraid of no longer having my leg. I know I would have no choice other than to accept that my leg is gone and that I would have to adapt and adjust my life accordingly. But what I am afraid of is the physical pain that would come during the act/process of my leg being cut off. 

Any advice on how to conquer this fear?"
1,"Stoicism on trust-issues Hello,

I've recently started thinking about relationships. I found out I most likely have trust-issues. Well, will hsve trust issues.

I am currently not on a relationship but upon seing a relationship, I realised I might have trust-issues. I'm almost certain. It's due to my unpleasant, first relationship experience in the past.

To get prepared or get rid of that, I am asking for your help. I've been a follower of stoicism for 2 years and I had majorly infuenced my life. Do you have any suggestions how stoicism might help me cope with trust-issues?

Thanks, stay loving, peace, a reddit user."
1,"Vanity &amp; social media make me believe that Stoicism is more relative and helpful today than it ever was in the past. What do you think? Just began my journey with learning more about and exercising stoic philosophy last week. I'm in the middle of reading *How to Think Like a Roman Emperor* by Donald Robertson and the more I'm learning the more apparent to me the issues with social media are. Not that they weren't apparent before or aren't to anyone else, it just feels like with learning stoicism there's a constant reminder floating in front of my face. 

I scroll through Instagram and all I see now are people seeking validation and what I would call being vain. Stoicism teaches that vanity prevents yourself from looking at yourself objectively and recognizing your own faults to improve or change them. I of course engaged in this as well at various points in my life, but now I can definitely see both within myself and in others that it certainly did prevent myself from recognizing my own faults and changing them. Instagram or FaceBook or even Reddit gives you a false sense of validation that is often unearned or without merit. Even YouTube videos of stoicism itself, I'm sure the vast majority of people watch on 5 minutes Stoicism video and then feel like they know everything about the philosophy when Marcus Aurelius constantly studied and exercised the philosophy nearly his whole life. I suppose a true learner of Stoicism would have a real advantage compared to the majority people in this regard if you look at it this way. 

I also could be wrong to be looking at what others are doing on there and judging according to stoicism (not completely sure on that since I am still a stoicism noob). 

What do you think?"

I was sitting in a bus once, and we came to the railroad tracks. There were some cars sitting inbetween us and the next red light, so if a train came, we'd be stuck until it had passed. That was always a couple of annoying minutes.

Then the light turned green, and the bus went across the train tracks without having to wait for a train. Pheew, crisis averted. Then, behind me, a mother said to her small child:

""That was too bad, we didn't get to see the train today.""

That was the perfect way to frame that. Why not enjoy what you get?"

1,"Stoic Six Pack Hello all! I bought a book called the Stoic Six Pack. It has Meditations, The Golden Sayings of Epictetus, Fragments of Epictetus, Discourses of Epictetus, Letters from a Stoic, and the Enchiridion. Which book would be the best to start with from these? Thanks in advance!"
1,"""... it is the chief and the first work of a philosopher to examine appearances, and to distinguish them, and to admit none without examination."" This seems to involve a significant degree of intellectual independence. That quote is from [Discourses 1:20](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/epictetus/discourses/george-long/text/book-1#chapter-1-20), which describes the importance of seeing things plainly for what they are, if we are to have any hope of responding reasonably to it.

It also describes, in passing, how our reasoning faculty is itself comprised of earlier judgments. Every mistake we make in interpreting the outside world is more than just a localized error, because it dilutes and contaminates the very tool we use to make subsequent judgements.

It only occurred to me just a few moments ago  that what's really required of us here is _a comfort with independent thought._ I put two and two together this morning while reading [an interesting essay about independent thinking](http://paulgraham.com/think.html), and seeing the many apparent  connections:

&gt;You can also take more explicit measures... The most general is to cultivate an attitude of skepticism. When you hear someone say something, stop and ask yourself ""Is that true?"" Don't say it out loud. I'm not suggesting that you impose on everyone who talks to you the burden of proving what they say, but rather that you take upon yourself the burden of evaluating what they say.

&gt;Treat it as a puzzle. You know that some accepted ideas will later turn out to be wrong. See if you can guess which. The end goal is not to find flaws in the things you're told, but to find the new ideas that had been concealed by the broken ones. So this game should be an exciting quest for novelty, not a boring protocol for intellectual hygiene. And you'll be surprised, when you start asking ""Is this true?"", how often the answer is not an immediate yes. If you have any imagination, you're more likely to have too many leads to follow than too few.

&gt;**More generally your goal should be not to let anything into your head unexamined, and things don't always enter your head in the form of statements. Some of the most powerful influences are implicit.** How do you even notice these? By standing back and watching how other people get their ideas.

&gt;When you stand back at a sufficient distance, you can see ideas spreading through groups of people like waves. The most obvious are in fashion: you notice a few people wearing a certain kind of shirt, and then more and more, until half the people around you are wearing the same shirt. You may not care much what you wear, but there are intellectual fashions too...

&gt;[...]

&gt;It seems to me that it has three components: fastidiousness about truth, resistance to being told what to think, and curiosity.

&gt;**Fastidiousness about truth means more than just not believing things that are false. It means being careful about degree of belief.** For most people, degree of belief rushes unexamined toward the extremes: the unlikely becomes impossible, and the probable becomes certain. To the independent-minded, this seems unpardonably sloppy... 

&gt;The independent-minded thus have a horror of ideologies, which require one to accept a whole collection of beliefs at once, and to treat them as articles of faith. To an independent-minded person that would seem revolting, just as it would seem to someone fastidious about food to take a bite of a submarine sandwich filled with a large variety of ingredients of indeterminate age and provenance.

&gt;[...]

&gt;The second component of independent-mindedness, resistance to being told what to think, is the most visible of the three. But even this is often misunderstood. The big mistake people make about it is to think of it as a merely negative quality. The language we use reinforces that idea. You're unconventional. You don't care what other people think. But it's not just a kind of immunity. In the most independent-minded people, the desire not to be told what to think is a positive force. It's not mere skepticism, but an active delight in ideas that subvert the conventional wisdom, the more counterintuitive the better.

&gt;[...]

&gt;The third component of independent-mindedness, curiosity, may be the most interesting...

&gt;In my experience, independent-mindedness and curiosity predict one another perfectly. Everyone I know who's independent-minded is deeply curious, and everyone I know who's conventional-minded isn't...

&gt;**The three components of independent-mindedness work in concert: fastidiousness about truth and resistance to being told what to think leave space in your brain, and curiosity finds new ideas to fill it.**

This really jives with my understanding of how we examine appearances, which is a critical and essentially non-stop task. It's nice to see it as ""an exciting quest for novelty, not a boring protocol for intellectual hygiene""."

We all must be angry and mad at something or someone,but is it a good idea to do it knowingly at times where it is silent and cant hurt us.

1,"Always treat others with respect. reflecting on my day brought me to the thought process of when dealing with any person, no matter how they are behaving, you should always treat them with respect. sometimes people are difficult and rude and it is easy to react in a defensive or aggressive way. though we should treat each interaction precisely and calmly. i do not mean to be a pushover and let people walk on you but rather deal with things with dignity and understanding, because otherwise you are compromising your own virtue. lead by example, treat others well and they are inclined to treat you that way. also this shows true maturity and integrity. :)"

I am physically crippled, I cannot work, I can barely walk, but for some reason I feel that I must shoulder the worlds burdens and have a want to reshape the world for the better, both of which I know are impossible for me.

I avoid websites like Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr which have toxic communities, but I still end up looking for contraversy that makes me dislike a person, or seeing people act entitled which makes me judge them, I wish to live internally, to live for myself, I myself need selfcare, but I am not providing it, I don't want to care about what others think, especially when I know they cannot realistically affect me."

1,"I turned 23 today and made sure as few people knew as possible For context, I'm 23 years old today and viscerally, birthdays meant a whole deal to me, which is why as a challenge to myself, I've removed my birthday from all social media, including linked in, as a kid, I remember I always felt disappointed about how my birthday went, didn't feel "" special enough"" had cringey Facebook posts when I was 12ish saying things like "" tomorrow is my birthday"" lmao. 

Years of disappointment when it came to my birthday I came to realise that the problem wasn't the situation, but my perception of the situation, that is not to say that people didn't disappoint me, with my ex on her birthday, I made sure I conveyed how important that day was for me, with gifts, time spent, my words to her etc, and she couldn't even do 1/4th of all of that for me, and I don't blame her coz she isn't the affectionate and expressive type, she couldn't even do that for her mom. Plus they say exes are exes for a reason right? ( I made it sounds like I broke up with her but that wasn't the case :p, though in hindsight I'm glad she did)

I'm the funny guy, the clown of any group im part of and been told that I should try standup comedy, but hardly anyone knows that this humour has developed as a defense mechanism from always having an innate sadness, maybe it's been a generic predisposition. I objectively have everything, a family I love more than life itself and a couple of close friends, but I'm still not passing the vibe check but I'm working towards it

I used to look at people celebrating their friends birthdays with loads of stories on Instagram and I was always jealous, I wanted the whole shebang too, so this year I completely toppled my own expectations and so far I've cut a cake with my family got wishes from them, got a wish from one friend, another knows since he's been pointing it out for a week but hasn't wished maybe because I said I just want peace and quite and will be chilling at home on my birthday to him. 

Now it looks like this has nothing to do with stoicism but stoicism is my major reason for doing this, it is to show myself that at the end of the day I only need myself, I have to be a better friend to myself, and as Seneca said - "" expectations are the greatest impediment to living"" I have curbed my expectations of being celebrated on my birthday, snapchat has harassed me everyday to put a birthday icon on my bitmoji or something but I didn't give in. I'm weirdly proud of myself.

1,"My experience with Stoic Principles I had a test today in which I could have gotten full marks but because of my stupidity it did not go very well. 
What followed was dismay, panic, anxiety and headache. I was tempted to turn to porn to distract myself.

But all through this, I kept telling myself that the test is over and the result is not in my control so I shouldnt fret over it and I wouldn't have reacted this way if some other person told me that their test went bad and turning to porn is non virtuous. 
Initially, it did not work and I got more and more depressed but I kept on going and then calmed down.

So in my experience just knowing the principles is not enough. It is only by practising these principles will you gain mastery over it."
1,"A non-judgemental Stoic perspective I'll jump straight to the point. I am deeply concerned about the change taking place in my country, Britain. Not only are we building extensively on green areas, our communities are transforming and, as far as I can see, this isn't exactly having a great effect on cohesion.   


I live in what was a pretty small market town in the midlands and over the past few years houses are shooting up everywhere and countryside is being built upon. The face of my town is changing fairly quickly, taking its sense of community with it. When I look at what has now taken place in both large and also smaller cities, I fear that this will only get worse here.   


Now, Marcus spoke about accepting change and how change is *natures delight.* He also wrote about the foolishness of trying to resist change, but like most things in the modern world, this is far from natural. I try to block it out, I try to go further within myself and appreciate what I have. I try to remind myself that most individuals are good and that this is all completely out of my control, but it's something that is really draining my emotional wellbeing. I try to fight it but thinking about my town in 5, 10 or 15 years really drives my mood down - especially given that I have a two year old and, like any parent, I worry about what she may face.   


When I take my walks I find myself being disturbed as I watch these housing developments spring up all over the place, taking green and pleasant land with them.   


So, anyway, I'd like your thoughts on this. I suppose we all have our weaknesses and this is one of mine. How would you approach this and avoid despair in my situation?"

1,"When are things good? Things are good when you can face life confidently, knowing that you can take on any challenge that destiny throws at you.

Things are good when you focus on the present. You live today and do your best work here and now.

Things are good when you deeply accept and love your current position in life. You’re happy about the person you are today, the people around you, and everything else in your life - “good” or “bad”.

Things are good when you are not doing anything immoral. You’re not screwing people over to get a personal benefit. You’re a social being and focused on committing social acts that benefit other people.

Things are good when you don’t let your future ambitions distort your present. Focus on doing your best work now and leave the rest to the universe to work out.

The only real benefit in life is to be a good man. To enjoy every moment you’ve been given, commit good acts, and fulfill your role in this universe without blinking an eye in the face of adversity if it should arise.

Things are good when you’ve achieved peace. This is the ultimate goal. Focus on the present, love whatever life throws at you, and stop trying to control the things you don’t control.

1,"Jake the Dog from Adventure Time I’ve seen posts on here before showing examples of Jake being stoic or showing stoic qualities, such as him making an example of throwing his favorite cup out the window, to express that it was material and temporary and now that it was gone he no longer cared. The more I think about his character the more I see Jake as a Stoic. He was always very open to the universe and whatever happened around him, even death. There were multiple references and even an entire episode regarding jakes perspective on death. He had a “cosmic” dream which in the show meant that it was destined to come true, and in this dream he died. When he woke up he welcomed it with acceptance. To expand on this comparison, Jake is literally friends with “Death” personified who is a character in the show, and while there isn’t too much plot surrounding their friendship, it was pointed out or mentioned on multiple occasions that Jake was a friend of death, and death a friend of jakes.

You know how it goes, sometimes nothing happens and sometimes everything at once. Obviously Covid is making everything more difficult.

My grandpa, someone I look up to and consider very wise (I dare say he comes closest to being a natural stoic) faced his diagnosis with strength and perseverance, but the second, larger blow that is my grandma's diagnosis hit him really hard. I see the sadness in his eyes as he slowly comes to terms with the inevitable. His spirit is not what it was, and it hurts seeing him quietly suffering in his sorrows.

I know we've been extremely lucky to enjoy the company of my elders well into their 80s. Stoicism has helped me a lot this year and I do feel prepared for whatever we may face. However I do not know how to communicate my courage and perseverance to my grandparents, especially grandpa (my grandma does not understand well enough the serious nature of the diagnosis, and as of now still has high spirits). How do you give courage to a man who knows his and his loved one's end is near? How do you help him find peace and comfort?

Apologies for the long post. I'm trying to be a column of support for my grandparents and the rest of my family during this time, but it is indeed tough at moments. Stay safe!"
1,"How do you keep your own contentment? I have been very into this idea of life. Stoicism fits my true, inner personality really well. 

However, blah blah blah we are all complex beings. 

My point of asking you all here is that my heart hurts at some points. Which is fine. I know. But like. A lot sometimes. And it’s just. That’s not fun. 

I sometimes feel overwhelmed by the suffering of others and my inability to do that much. I understand and believe in starting somewhere, anywhere. And saving even just one. But I’m a mom now. 2020 has happened. I don’t know how to live with my expensive wardrobe (that I want and love! But I have a few luxury items I bought prior to the pandemic and it’s changed my consumer mind. 

I still love clothes. Still love fashion. But I hate capitalism. I hate that addicts are lesser people because we have been conditioned to choose things over people. 

Do I just balance? Automate donations and not think about it?  

How do I come to terms with this juxtaposition “once and for all”? Or is it not like that?"

1,"I dont know what to make out of friendships anymore From time to time I find myself seeking friends, but in the end I remain unsatisfied how everything is going and create a dislike for them for some reasons. (Like them being disinterested or rude towards me, or being toxic in general)

First of all I dont have many friends, I am quite eccentric and somewhat introverted and have interest and opinions only little people share or are interested in.
But I liked to spend time with people from time to time.
This makes everything harder regarding finding company. 

I know these things are indifferent, but I am finding myself more and more in the conclusion that I dont want friends or at least the friends I have now. 

I try to put myself out there and finding new people but constantly feel like a alien in a group.
I understand that my own self assesment is what makes this scenario worse, but it is the way I am feeling.

I seriously doubt that there are many kind hearted people out there. 

All in all, everything is fine, I guess. I dont know what to make out of this situation. It feels like my whole life I was never understood neither by friends or relatives...
I always had the want for just one friend who wouldnt let me down, but I guess this ""want"" is very frugal and pointless in the end.

What is your guys take on this?"
1,"i need your stoic advice (new to reddit) Hello to everyone..im new in reddit.

I wanted to ask a question and ask for your advice.

If a rich family wants you to inherit their company which generates millions income per year..would you accept it ?

If you come from a poor family and suddenly you have the offer to Inherit a big Company and become a millionaire..

How would a stoic react to such an offer...and how would you feel if you get an offer like that.

Sorry for my bad english"
1,"Why isn't reputation on my control? As a person who suffers from social anxiety and worries about other's people opinion (even though I know it's unnecessary, I can't convince myself to stop doing it), finding stoicism has helped me realise that some things are beyond our control, so worrying about them is useless, like for death for example. However, while it sound logical to me, I don't think I truly believe this, because more or less, we have a certain amount of control in everything. I would like to focus on reputation since that's what's causing me a lot of unnecessary anxiety right now. Isn't reputation on a degree in our control? If I decide to act completely normal and how everyone expects me to, I won't have a lot of people criticize me. But if I, for some reason, make people think I'm an asshole, weird or weak, or generally don't fit their expectations, people will criticize me. I would like to hear you correct me, but how isn't reputation, on a percent at least, in my control?


P.S. another example that comes to mind: One day I decided to test myself to see if I can handle the criticism for letting a girl polish my nail at school (I'm a boy lol). My friends immediately called me out and a number of people now mistake me for gay. Overall it was a interesting experience but it just goes to show that if you do something out of the ordinary, people will judge you, so reputation is kinda in your control."
1,"Advice on rewarding myself I recently got into a good university. My grades are good. 
So I just now felt the urge to ask my parents if they are proud of me. Then I thought why should I bother to know if my parents are proud of me or not?
Why should I derive happineds from that?

The only thing I should derive happiness from is by knowing that I am doing my best and I am doing the virtuous thing.

So which activities do you suggest I should do to reward myself?
Any activities I can think of require atleast 2-3 hours which I think speaks a bit about indulgence on my part. Plus they consume time which I cant afford to waste.

So which activities do you suggest?"

1,"Do not seek for things to happen the way you want them to ""Do not seek for things to happen the way you want them to; rather, wish that what happens happen the way it happens: then you will be happy."" -Epictetus

&amp;#x200B;

What ultimately drove me into studying and practicing Stoicism is my unhealthy habit of trying to control things. My mother always taught me that in order to succeed in life, one should essentially make things happen. Though what she taught me is absolutely reasonable, I somehow took it to another level in which I tried controlling other people, especially significant others. I've always been terrified of being left behind, unloved, and eventually, die alone to the point that I wanted my SO to have their life revolved around me. I realize now how wrong this is. I should let things happen the way it should. Let people love me the way they want to. Let people fall out of love. Let people leave.   


By trying to control others' feelings towards us, not only do we hurt them but we also rob ourselves of the chance of true feelings from other people."
1,"Advice on how to cope when you are down So I ended up fapping yesterday. Today, I couldnt wake up at time and missed my workout. I feel terrible but I still took my classes because I told myself that duty comes first. 
Right now all I want is to put my head in my gf's lap and relax while she caresses my head but we had a fight. The next best thing would be talking with my mom but she is ill and she refuses to talk so that I dont get ill because I have classes.

I keep telling myself that how I feel shouldnt affect my duties and that I should keep going but it is very difficult. Is this just me or has anyone else experienced this too?

How do I cope with this? People have coped woth worse things without wanting to look to other people for comfort. 

What should I do?"
1,"Inner Citadel Brief Book Review The Inner Citadel is an interesting book that deeply analyzes Marcus Aurelius and Stoic Philosophy.   Pierre Hadot displays a great deal of knowledge about stoicism and Marcus's life that is much more than you will ever find by just reading the meditations or any other primary stoic source.  He systematically breaks down stoicism, and shows how the meditations is actually a grouping of certain key virtues, rather than random sayings.  

What I found most interesting was Hadot's analysis of the key virtues and disciplines, and I specifically took note of the exercises that stoic's like Marcus used to achieve these disciplines, such as the reserve clause.

I definitely would not recommend this book to anyone new to stoicism, since it is quite dense and can easily put you off on such a great philosophy if this is your first exposure to it.  You're better off reading meditations.

I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in knowing more about stoic philosophy from a historical point of view, and anyone who wants an overall better understand of stoicism.  

Although, I think this is an interesting work that people should definitely check out if they're interested, I just want to give a heads up that the book can become quite dense at times and be very slow to read.  This is due to all of the historical information that Hadot gives which can be overwhelming at times.  I think the most important part of the book is Hadot's analysis of the philosophy and it's structure which is in the middle of the book, so remember that if you ever get the book and feel like it starts slow.

Hope this helps anyone thinking of getting the book."

1,"Can anyone please provide the details of this passage, who wrote it and what index?  “Train yourself next to use wine with discretion, not so as to be able to drink it in quantity— for there are some people who are so uncouth as to train themselves for that— but so as to be able to keep away, first of all, from wine, and then from a pretty girl, or a honey-cake. And then one day, by way of a test, if the occasion presents itself, you’ll venture into the lists to see whether your impressions still get the better of you as they once did. But to begin with, keep well away from what is stronger than you.

As Epictetus teaches us: Challenge your impressions.

Ask yourself why you are doing X, Y and Z.

If you are mindlessly making decisions based on some seemingly arbitrary general consensus, then pause for a moment and meditate on which action alligns with your core values and virtues.

Disclaimer: When I say consensus, I don't mean scientific consensus. The scientific method is far and away the best way of informing what we would consider virtuous actions in a situation like the one we are in."

1,"Growth through Tragedy A couple years ago, after Grandma had died and before I came out as trans, I lived a horrible life of anxiety, depression, and ungratefulness. I spent most of my days being angry and resentful and not accomplishing anything. This culminated in breakdown that left me unable to think clearly or even leave my bed. But when something is broken it must be fixed.

It was not through practice but necessity that I started to practice stoicism. Even before reading about it. It was through suffering that I built an unbreakable willpower. 

Only after I recovered from this depressive episode was I able to see how truly beautiful the world is. I learnt to have complete control over my emotions. I learnt to forgive but not forget.

It is through hardship that I, without even knowing it, adopted stoicism."
1,"Was Diogenes mentally ill? I know Diogenes wasn't a Stoic but of course he was one of the main reasons why Stoicism came about. What I would like to know is, would be classed as mentally ill by today's standards and how much so? He seemed like someone who was able toc completely detach himself from his own ego, which I think is a really good thing, however I'm not sure how anyone completely sane could actually achieve this to the extent that Diogenes apparently did. He walked around barely clothed, lived in filth with dogs and shouted at passers-by. Whilst I think that it shows a good example of how we should not care about the external world, especially in order to be happy these really don't sound like the actions of a sane person. Was he happy? We should believe so from what we've heard about him yet it#s hard to believe that someone who was a Cynic and not an actual Stoic could be so happy without any external sources of happiness whilst also being mentally stable."

1,"I don't really understand the concept of Virtue in Stoicism. To me, there is no inherent meaning in the world, as I don't fully believe in a God (although I believe that there could well be one, just not in a religious sense). I don't really now how 'good' and 'bad' should be characterized. I believe that evolution is mostly where our instincts not to kill fellow humans etc. comes from, along with societal conditioning.

1,"It's never to late to start again Hello my friends. I would say that I am new to this sub but that would be me lying. I have created this new account after deleting my old one because if I am being honest, I did not like the person I was becoming and I felt that one of the largest obstacles to be becoming the man I am want to be, was my original account. 

That being said, I wanted to essentially make this post in order to give some words of encouragement to those who believe that it is impossible for them to turn their life around. I wanted to take a second to remind those of you feeling this that it is never too late to turn your life around. We live in a crazy world, one which is filled with all manner of nastiness, harshness, and all around absurdity. So, it should come as no surprise that sometimes we as people let some of this get into the inner sanctum that is our minds or as many great stoics call it, our inner fortresses. I understand this, it is a natural thing for we are humans and we worry. But sometimes this worrying and this turmoil becomes to great and begins to consume us which causes us to go into a depression. It's than that the thoughts of doubt begin to surface.

""Why is my life not what it should be?""

""Why am I such a failure?""

""Can I ever change?"" 

These are some of the various thoughts that cloud our minds and they are extremely difficult to shake.  But I am here to tell you all, that yes you can turn your life around, you can be the person you want to be in this world. All it takes is the right blend of self belief, community, and the constant need to improve upon yourself with grit and determination. Each and every one of us in this world has the ability to change and become better. We are stronger than we know, You dear reader are stronger than you know. 

So while there are things within this world that we cannot control, one of the greatest things we can control is our will to go on and our will to be better people than we were yesterday. so I want to wish all of you and your families a Happy and Safe Thanksgiving much love to all of you and last but not least.

1,"Life is like a dog leashed to a carriage You either get dragged by the carriage, or you could choose to walk, and let it take you places. 

If you let the carriage drag you create resistance for the carriage but walking gets harder and harder, and it may actually cause more harm then good. It is like being constantly anxious about death, it may actually do good, since you will avoid things which are deemed dangerous, at the same time the constant anxiety will slowly take more years off your life, and you will become more anxious as you have been fighting time your whole life, and now going with the flow is difficult as your legs have been battered by years of resistance. But if you choose to walk, nothing good happens, you just choose this way, and at the end, you stop walking.

1,"Another stoic exercise in gratitude Inspired by the previous post, and various articles I'd read on PsychologyToday, I hope that this is a good place to carry out an exercise in gratitude. The last post gave me some things to think about (though of course Thanksgiving isn't something we celebrate across the pond).

I am grateful for having such a challenging and varied job; If it wasn't challenging, I wouldn't get to strive towards self-actualisation. It's in those challenges that I find the opportunities to practice and refine my positive coping strategies; If it wasn't varied, I wouldn't be learning. To me learning is a part of every virtue and a life without learning would hardly be called living. 

I am grateful for being alive and having a job to go to and food in the cupboards, when this year it could have easily gone so different.

For my senses I am more than grateful, allowing me to absorb these experiences of everything around me and find the beauty in it. Where they start to fail me, I am glad that they reminded me of how rewarding it is to have them at all.

In the style of Mediations (Book I);

From my relatives: Set reminders to check up on people rather than care about them in secret.

From my colleague who lended me his ear: Maintaining the awareness to recognise and emphasise with the state of others, which will take extra effort towards those you don't always see eye-to-eye with.

From my employer: For recognising the efforts of others before the efforts of your own. 

From my manager: For never boasting about lost sleep or lost weekends.

From my father: Answering the phone with a bit of humour which sets a positive tone from the start."

1,"Stoic rationality In order to develop stoic rationality, we need two things 
1. Clarity
2. Discipline.

Anyone who reads and understands stoic texts gains clarity. How to control anger, what does it mean to be a good human being, how to do one's duty etc are all addressed.

What remains is the life long commitment to these principles and that requires discipline.

So this is a post on how I think discipline can be built.

For the past 1 week, I wake up and within 1 hour complete my workout, my bath, make my bed and sit down for class. For the past 1 week, I haven't watched porn and today that I did, I didnt go for a round two. I dont say these things to boast but I say this to highlight a very basic fact: Little efforts make up for big results.

A 20 min workout is not big deal but as the day roll by, the novelty of waking up early and working out goes away. Same for making your bed and any other task you undertake. These are simple tasks and require no effort. But if that is the case, no problem will occur if I dont do them right?
Here is where I would like to disagree. Every day that you make your bed or exercise, you do a thing which you didn't want to do (sleeping in late is so much more appealing) but you did it anyways because it was good for you. Everyday that you dont lose your temper because the reactions of other people were never in your control, you distanced yourself from your base tendencies and gained a rational distance. 
Thus doing activites which are good for you like working out, reading a book, interacting socially while remembering stoic principles consistently prepare you for bigger challenges. In my case it was porn and the subsequent food binge. 

So when the urge hit today, I resisted for 4 hours, ended up watching porn and fapping but did not go for a round 2 and did not binge on food. Instead I chose to review some stoic concepts and get back to studying.
Yesterday, my sister offered me some oreos. My mouth watered but I took only 2 biscuits and declined the rest. 
Today, I told my mom not to disturb me while I was attending class.

Are these ground breaking things? No. But was I doing them earlier? No.

So my advice is to start with small things
1. Making your bed.
2. Speaking 1 less lie (the kind we tell implicitly to gain praise)
3. Working out 
4. Refusing junk
5. Controlling yourself just once to name a few. 
6. Resisting porn
These activites are drawn from my life and you could name different activites. But do things consistently and you will gain discipline. The kind which goes beyond motivation and emotion and reaches towards duty and rationality.

1,"Does anyone else struggle to hate or blame others? I find myself seeing a lot of hatred and blame around me, especially as I browse reddit. Through a difference in politics, race, religion, etc. Even despised people like murderers and rapists I struggle to truly hate. No doubt is murder and rape wrong. And no doubt some political decisions are wrong and harmful to society. But whenever I think of the people behind these things, I can't help but think ""but they're doing what they think is right"". I'm with Socrates in the belief that everyone does what they believe best, they follow their own version of right (which can often be wrong). So for the racist shouting slurs and threatening others with violence, I can't help but feel pity because they believe that is the right way to do things and the right way to act. Everyone is the subject of their biology and their environment, both of those things you ultimately cannot control. I think Stoicism is largely what influences me to think this way, though I have had similar feelings even as a kid.

Years later, the emperor Hadrian, (famed for his intelligence, but also his insecurity, argumentative temperament and pettiness) recognized the son of a patrician as his “verissimus” at court (He that speaks most truthfully: both a play on his surname of Verus, and his inclination and fondness for laconic, economically direct speech) 
Hadrian so admired the young patrician that he wanted him to be his immediate successor, though he was still but a boy. 
That patrician’s son went on to become Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, arguably the greatest emperor Rome ever had.

Consider if Zeno had arrived safely with his shipment of murex snails, had not met Crates (the Cynic philosopher) and had not founded his school in Athens. Marcus would have likely continued his education in rhetoric and sophistry as all young patricians men did. Perhaps he might even have embraced cynicism, and abandoned politics entirely!
Had he not, would he have even risen to the notice of Hadrian, at a time when all at the imperial court vied with each other in pursuit of glory and acclaim through fanciful and verbose rhetoric, rather than eschewing such empty vanities, choosing instead to seek a deeper understanding of truth and purpose? 
Imagine how Rome and the world at large would have suffered, had the thoroughly inept Lucius Verus become sole emperor, instead of co-emperor alongside Marcus.

Marcus didn’t want to become emperor, he would have much preferred to dedicate himself to academia. He abhorred violence (so much so that he decreed that gladiators ought to fight with dull blades rather than edged ones) yet he spent many years in command of the legions, defending Rome’s borders against hostile invaders. He was frequently ill, yet he travelled constantly during the Antonine Plague, bolstering his people’s morale, ensuring that they had their emperor’s love and that he would do all he could to steer Rome to safety. He eventually succumbed to illness himself, most likely the very same plague that so ravaged the empire.

We cannot hope to avoid the unavoidable, so long as we do, we will be wretched.
As Marcus Aurelius himself said
“The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way”

TLDR: Zeno of Citium was wholly invested in a shipment of murex snails, used chiefly to dye robes purple, the royal colour. 
The ship sank. He survived. Having nothing to do, he sought out a philosopher and became inspired to found his own school of philosophical thought. Thanks to his suffering and psychological fortitude, Marcus Aurelius and countless others had, and still have a system to look to, by which they can learn to bear their burdens more gracefully and to rejoice in the ability to do so"
1,Characters for a philosophy app I'm building 
1,"Am I Doing Something Wrong? From my understanding the Stoics held that pleasure is fleeting so we should put happiness into worshiping reason. I understand that pleasure and pain are both indifferents, but why should we indulge in any activity that goes into any pleasure? Pleasure should not matter anyways as reason should dictate all correct? It distracts me constantly if I choose paths of preferred indifferents by staving me off on my path of perfecting reason. On a side note it's also hard for me to even enjoy any pleasure all the way. When I experience the temporary feeling of pleasure it quickly diminishes when I remember that I should not be attached to these pleasures. I always remember it because I didn't want to be a slave to these pleasures as they could be removed from me at any second and putting my enjoyment on them gives me a sense of guilt. A type of guilt that feels bad for even indulging into futile things as they stray me from my path. Am I doing something wrong?"
1,"Found notes from an 18th-century user of r/stoicism So long story short, I am a history Ph.D. student and a fan of stoicism, so I have been nerding out and keeping a notebook of stoic quotes from *only* 17th-18th century translations to have as a personal help, but also as a prop at reenactments. It turns out the founding fathers of the US were big fans of Marcus Aurelius and Seneca the younger and kept notes of him. Anyway, if you look through the first few pages of this, you'll see a man from the 1720s keeping notes on Marcus Aurelius. It's neat to see how people almost exactly 300 years ago were trying to find strength in the same source material we are [https://books.google.com/books?id=ELs6AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=meditations+by+marcus+aurelius&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks\_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjXyd7ZgKDtAhUSsDEKHS3nBy8Q6AEwAHoECAQQAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false](https://books.google.com/books?id=ELs6AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=meditations+by+marcus+aurelius&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjXyd7ZgKDtAhUSsDEKHS3nBy8Q6AEwAHoECAQQAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)"
1,"Why we shouldn't Upvote or Downvote Sorry I had to make a new post about this *(I deleted the last one)* to clarifiy my position, and what I mean. I guess it will be taken down if that violates the rules. 

From what I understand, and a lot of you dont seem to. Is we should **not** *upvote* anything because there's no reason to. If someone is doing good job then thats virtue in itself, and virtue needs no reward. This is what *Marcus Aurelius* would say. And instead of *downvoting*, we should either teach them or put up with them (also what Marcus would say). Teach them by simply leaving a message explaining why their wrong, or why you disagree with them. 

If you dont want to do that then just put up with them (ignore them), there's no reason to downvote anyone. Or if you do then you should explain why like said earlier.

***P.S.*****,** *I know people like to twist words and interpet what im saying as me telling you what you should do. I'm not, im stimply stating what I think a real Stoic would do. If im wrong please explain why.*"
1,"Have the right expectations. A big part of your frustration comes from not having the right expectations.

Why do you get mad when driving?

Did you really expect nothing unexpected to happen in traffic? Did you expect nobody to cut you off? Did you expect there are no traffic jams in LA?

I don't think so. Not really.

Rationally we understand that “negative” things like that are a part of the experience.

And yet, we act surprised when something like that happens.

And decide to react, get mad.

To avoid this, you need to set the right expectations. You need the right value-judgments. 

Whenever you start a journey - no matter if a physical one with a car or any other kind of journey towards a goal, expect things to go wrong. Because they will.

You will be in a much better position to deal with the hiccups when you’re mentally prepared for it.

Have a safe journey."
1,"What do I do after I identify a thought as a trigger? 
Certain thoughts trigger my anxiety in regards to an ex. Certain events, places, sounds, images triggers me to negative scenarios about my ex. It takes me to painful future where I start a negative scenario in my head. 

How do I get over that? Observe it in peace, acknowledge it and then let it go so it doesnt hurt even if it visits again? 

Thank you"
1,"Upvoting and Downvoting? Lets admit it we all do it. But is it the Stoic thing to engage in this activity? At the heart of it its about opposing ideas. You disagree with someone and you want other people to also disagree with that person (or vice versa for upvotes). Im not saying it's wrong (idk is it?). To me thats just part of life's game that we play. As long as we dont take it seriously I guess its ok... Idk what do you guys think, how would a Stoic explain this?"
1,A wild Stoic appears. The comments end up at a neat discussion about Stoicism. 
1,"That One Should Disdain Unreason. As much as Stoicism contains a set of exercises and remembrances that help the practitioner to keep their emotions in balance, and a list of virtues to keep in mind at all times, it also implies at a deeper level the animosity towards unreason. That well of prophanity that is the source of fears, prejudices, and false judgements, it can also be systemized in order to make it easier to recognize and act accordingly against. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Superstition

It should need no explanation, we all know what it is, but unexamined superstitions are still common. Not everyone is a full time scientist or logician dedicated to understanding every aspect of the world, so we still commit to superstitious ideas from time to time without noticing. The practice is to be aware that we can still grow more if we try to replace them with proper understanding.

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Suspicion

By this I mean the kind of suspicion that fuels conspiracy theories, political polarization, prejudices and fear of the ""other"". This kind of media is everywhere on the news, from all sides of the spectrum. Everyone will want to make you be part of the in group by demonizing other groups. Have you noticed if you're doing it already?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Intuition

Every time you just ""feel"" you know something but haven't really given it a proper thought. It sticks in the mind and it seems almost harmless, yet it isn't. Without reason to tame it, intuition can make you believe all sorts of nonsense. As an extreme example, flat earthers believe the earth is flat because it looks flat. That's about it. If their intuition says it, it must be true. Right, you think it's funny, but aren't you doing the same but with different ideas?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Tradition

We keep doing something because we have always done something because it's what we've always done ever since we started doing it because it's something that we have to keep doing in order to maintain our traditions. You see? Sure, it's not that traditions will make you ill all of a sudden, but so many frivolities and nonsensical ideas are simply maintained out of tradition. If you are to cultivate your mind, you must either find their real purpose or change for the better. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- So as you see, our attitude towards the good must include disdain for the bad. It's not enough to love what we desire but to hate what we despise. The case for not disdaining unreason despite presuming to be people that practice reason seems flimsy to me."
1,"Fear of Death I think I’ve been watching too many horrific crimes or accidents such as a husband watching his wife decapitated, the missing MH370 plane, being drugged and raped, just jogging around &amp; somebody would rape and kill you..drowning..getting killed in an explosion, plane crash..

Maybe I am more scared of the way of dying. As much as possible, I don’t wanna go through horrible ways of dying.

I feel so anxious and scared that at any moment I’ll meet God in an instant for whatever reason.

I don’t know how to find comfort in this particular “fear” I have. 

Is there even comfort? Or should acceptance enough of your fate even horrible enough to give you solace?"
1,"Today is my birthday. I am a year closer to death. On this seemingly ""special"" day, let me remain humbled by reminding myself that today is a day scattered among the rest. And as such, it may also be my last day on earth. So let me live today as I have the days that came before; like there is no tomorrow. May this day be a simple reminder that everyone of us will soon perish from this earth, so make the most out of your stay here. Know that everything that has happened to you this year was meant to happen. So live, love, and laugh with no regrets.

Anyway, I'm gonna have a beer, cheers to you wonderful people! Memento mori, Memento vivere!"
1,"I'm having premiere of my directed play in two days for my collage qualification, how to stay calm? I keep rationalizing and writing everything down every day, but i'm still having thoughts and imaginations of how things will go, if ill remember everything i need to do, what kinda errors might happen, if my actors wont mess up, how teachers and friends will react, fantasies of success.

I try to focus on what i can control. In the end everything will be alright and all this suffering is useless. When i will be there, then i will act in my ability. But the thoughts still pup up and i fall into spiral of arranging things that will have to be done and fantasies."

1,"Vital passages (in your opinion) I am trying to transcribe and learn from heart some of my favorite Stoic passages. Please post your favorite ones too and maybe we can discuss some of these passages or get inspired to (re-)read some of the particular Stoic works mentioned.

Here goes

&gt;""Everywhere you have looked, but you have not found the good life. Not in riches, not in fame, not in logic, not in sensual pleasures. Where, then, is it to found? In behaving in accordance with the principles of good and evil. What principles, then, are these? That there is nothing that is good for a man that does not make him courageous, just, wise and self-controlled. And  there is nothing bad for a man that does not make him the opposite of these."" - Marcus Aurelius

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""One's happiness rests on the quality of one's thoughts"" - Marcus Aurelius

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When fate should tempt you to feel bitterness, do not think ""This is a misfortune!"". Think instead, ""the opportunity to bear this worthily is good fortune"". - Marcus Aurelius

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""Before you indulge in a sensual pleasure, bring to mind two points in time. The first, how you will feel while indulging in the *fleeting* pleasure, and the feel shame and disappointment in yourself afterwards for having succumbed to temptation. The second, the pride, self-respect, joy, and strength will feel in yourself after having rejected the pleasure."" - Seneca (*On the Shortness of Life*)"
1,Can someone recommend a book on Stoicism for someone who has just been introduced to it? 
1,"Question about available editions of Epictetus's works So I started out with Aurelius's Meditations and now I want to read Epictetus. After reading some on what there is I have an outlined idea of what there is and preferrably I would like to get one book which include all of it (the handbook, discourses, and miscellaneous). It seems the [Oxford World's Classics edition](https://www.adlibris.com/fi/kirja/discourses-fragments-handbook-9780199595181) is the most complete all-in-one book available and doesn't eg. exclude any chapters of the handbook which the [Penguin edition](https://www.adlibris.com/fi/kirja/discourses-and-selected-writings-9780140449464) purportedly does.

Is there anyone in the know who can confirm this to me?. I'd find it regrettable if I purchased a book only to find out after the fact that it's an edition which excludes parts."
1,"CALLING STOICS FOR HELP!! I'm 20 year old guy who recently got into stoicism. I'm currently reading ""Meditations"".

I'm addicted to masturbation / porn and I've been trying to quite for months. I know self control is a big thing in stoicism but I can't do it how much I try.

How would you Stoics counter this problem?"
1,Afraid of sitting with thoughts . I am a 23 year old male who deals with anxiety and depression and I’m ready to stop so many bad habits but one of the main things I just realized I’m struggling with is that every time I do an activity I have to be stimulated in another way if I’m playing a video game I have to talk on the phone or listen to something if I’m working on music I might be on the phone with someone or sometimes I play a podcast in the back while I work . This morning I realized I never truly focus on anything because I’m always multitasking I just wanted to see what advice you guys have or have you dealt with this in the past
1,"Stoicism for a Better Life - Weekly exercise (November 25) Hello there, 

Diogenes Laertius was a biographer and wrote extensively about the lives and philosophies of the ancient Greek philosophers. The book of his we have today is the translation *Lives of the Eminent Philosophers,* which contains a lot of the information we have about the predominant philosophers of ancient Greece (which was in Ionia; a region on the central part of the western coast of Anatolia in present-day Turkey). For this week’s exercise, I will seek some inspiration from a snippet in his book regarding Heraclitus IX 7:

&gt;""Heraclitus called self-deception an awful disease and eyesight a lying sense.""  

We lie. You lie. Don't deny it, you do it every day. And worse, we lie to ourselves more than anyone else. But today's exercise is not about earning a badge of honesty. It is about earning the strength and courage to view the world more objectively than we have ever viewed it before. Because we do lie to ourselves about it constantly. Our lies are especially potent and poisonous regarding our impressions of our external world. 

We see the world through our own perceptions and ""describe it"" in our own internal narrative. So we can't really be faulted for having an ego-centric view of things. All we have ever known is the world from our perspective. But what our ancient guides try and teach us and remind us is that this view is very subjective by its nature and that we cannot make good objective choices based on a subjective view of the world around us. Therefore, we must try and try hard to see the world as objectively as possible. With this objective view of the reality around us, we can make better decisions for our own lives and the greater good. 

**So as a practical exercise this week, don't rush to conclusions about what you see, hear or observe. Don't rush to conclusions about anything, especially your judgments, because your senses are often wrong, your emotions are overly sensitive, your hopes overly optimistic and your fears overly pessimistic.** Your time is valuable and your efforts are important and impactful. So make sure you take the time to absorb the pertinent information around you as best as you can (i.e. as objectively as possible) before you make a judgment or decide on an action.

I wish you a productive and tranquil week. If you feel like it, share your stories and accomplishment or challenges. These stories always help inspire others.

1,"I've been following a stoic philosophy without even knowing it thanks to a Facebook post When i was a teenager spending hours looking at memes on Facebook, i saw an image that really resonated with me, the concept was ""do not worry. Can you do something about it? If yes, there is no need to worry, if no, worrying won't help"". 

Ever since then i've been following this philosophy, without even knowing about stoicism. With the lockdown in my country this year, i've felt like i've started to lose my peace, so i read and found out about stoicism. 

I will be buying my first book on stoicism this week, Meditations. I hope that this philosophy will resonate with me and that it will accompany me in my life. Wish me luck!"

1,"Insight into praise, hate and honesty This dawned upon me after a fight with my gf.

She was upset with me for a reason I thought was stupid. But despite being tired and in pain, I tried to keep my emotions in control and listen to her. Yet she remained angry with me.

So it dawned upon me that even doing my best doesn't mean people will like it. Similarly, the most atrocious people in history get praise too. Example, Hitler.

So, in accordance with with stoic principle of not giving value to things you can't control, I realised that getting upset after being treated badly and getting happy after being praised are all wrong reactions because praise blame and admiration is as fickle as the crowd that gives it. This lead me to believe that as long as I am doing the best I can, I shouldn't be bothered by reactions of other people. This further made me realize that if that is the case, then I have no cause to lie to anyone. 

This made me realize the meaning of detachment. If all that I value is my own action, then external things like praise or hate all lose their value. Thus, I am detached from these things even if I operate amidst them."
1,"What stoic text or teaching has helped you most in life? For me, I'd say this one is probably one of my favorite quotes to re-read:

Material things are indifferent; how we use them is not. How then may a man maintain not only steadiness and calm, but also the state of mind that is careful and neither reckless nor negligent? He can act like people playing a board game. The game pieces are neither good nor bad, nor are the dice. How can I know what the next throw of the dice will be? But to use the throw carefully and skillfully, this belongs to me. In life, too, then, the principal task is this: to distinguish and separate things, and say: “Externals are outside my power: my choices are within my power. Where shall I seek the good and the bad? Within, in the things that are my own.” But in what depends on others, call nothing either good or bad, benefit or harm, or anything else of the kind. “What then? Does this mean we shouldn’t care how we use them?” By no means. That would be a wrongful use of our faculty of choice, and so contrary to nature. External things should be used with care, because their use can be good or bad. But at the same time you should keep your composure and your calm, because the things themselves are neither good nor bad. 


-Epictetus, Discourses 2.5.1–7"
1,"Thanksgiving: A Stoic Practice Tomorrow is Thanksgiving day in United States. There is a common(at least where I'm from) tradition of naming things you are grateful for that surrounds the holiday, and I've been thinking about what this means for a Stoic. Because most things we would commonly name are externals(health, wealth, family, good food, a place to live, a job, even life etc.), should we still focus on them and be thankful for them, when we do not control them?

Yes. In fact, we should be even MORE thankful for them, because we as Stoics understand that we might not have them tomorrow. Stoicism isn't about not loving things, it's about not taking them for granted and assuming they'll always be there. So tomorrow(or whenever), when you sit down and list things you are grateful for, keep their temporary nature in mind and you might find yourself more genuinely grateful for what fate has granted you presently. 

Just something I thought about. Cheers."
1,"Would a stoic compliment or flatter someone? Currently listening to an audiobook: “How To Think Like A Roman Emperor”

I’m sure many of you here have read or heard of this book. It talks about how philosophers in general place virtue above vanity because vanity causes you not to observe yourself objectively thereby stopping you from being virtuous. 

How about when it comes to others? 

How does a stoic view complimenting or flattering someone else such as a family member or friend? So long as it’s based in reality that could be considered virtuous no?"
1,"I am angry at my neighbor The neighbor yelled at my kids. she ran to her dad crying that something happened. But she was also trying to do the same thing to my girl. So he yelled at them to get out. 

I feel protective of my children.  And I know stoicism has helped me calm down and find my balance in life. But for this new experience I am having difficulty regaining peace in my heart."
1,"A Problem with the Dichotomy of Control So... the things stated by stoic followers that are my judgement and actions. But I have a problem. I have used my influence and work ethic to control outcomes beyond action and internal items. 

So... taking the dichotomy further, there seems to be other things within my control. Granted, when things don't go right, or virtuous, I worry or try to control makes me worry, but the successes seem to outweigh the failure. Granted emotionally there is stress trying to control these outcomes. 

Any thought about making or just having things outside of your  judgment and actions, but they are still in your control.?

Small example, stoics say your rep isn't in your control or your wealth, but are they not? Assuming there isn't a pandemic or 2008 crash, or a depression. Or Barring someone better than you manipulating your rep? 

Short version, are Mark Twain's characters in control of things that stoics would say are outside of your control with the fence painting, for example?"
1,"Insight into control and duty I think this needs some backstory. 
I am a phd student and I am required to study a lot. Somedays the only time I leave my table is to eat food and even then I cant complete my work for the day. I also believe that if I take care of my body then it will help me mentally(healthy mind in a healthy body logic)

So here is my schedule:
wake up at 830am,  exercise and bath till 930 am then classes till 130 pm.

Here is what happened today:
I woke up at 830 with a terrible headache and body pain. Still finished my exercise by 910. But then my father went into the bathroom and didnt come out until 920. I took my bath and came out at 935. Missed 5 mins of class. Today was introductory class and the concepts which were being taught had already been introduced. So class was ruined. On top of that my internet was very slow today so I couldnt understand most of what was said. In addition, this particular teacher doesn't teach very well.

This all frustrated me a lot and I almost quit the class.
But then I thought of the concept of control.
The actions of my father are not in my control. The teacher's way of teaching, the internet etc are not in my control. What is in my control is to try my best.

So I stayed and in the end could answer 1 question. Did I understand it all? NO. Does work need to be done? YES.

But I am happy that I did my duty.


Tl;dr: By realizing what was in my control I was able to do my duty as a student despite the circumstances."

1,"This video beautifully illustrates Marcus Aurelius' thoughts about how small we are and how insignificant our time is in the greater scheme of things.  

&gt;Remember: Matter. How tiny your share of it. Time. How brief and fleeting your allotment of it. Fate. How small a role you play in it.  
— Marcus Aurelius

This is an amazing video by [u/melodysheep](https://www.reddit.com/u/melodysheep/). I have been trying to embrace the Stoic way of life since the past 3 years when I came across Stoicism during a difficult phase of life when I was 20. One night I came back home after a party and was a little stoned, I tried to ponder upon this quote by Marcus Aurelius and just searched on YouTube 'timeline of the universe' and came across this masterpiece.

Everything from the visuals to the sound track is beautifully crafted. This video is an experience and had quite a profound effect on the way I looked at quotidian happenings. I highly recommend taking some time out and checking this out."

1,"Need to head strategies that can help me limit my awful habit of overreacting. I grew up in a family that liked to argue for sport. Being right was the goal and tell someone what they should do, with broad stroke rationalizations was a way of life. 

It caused all kinds of conflict. 

Now, I'm a father and I have a crushing stress which tends to make me overreact. It's like I have PTSD and my brain reacts at the slightest perceived inconvenience. 

Stoicism has always drawn my attention. Seems like the stoics knew how tap into a level of self soothing awareness and control, perhaps by practicing letting go of that which is out of their controls. 

I would love that but how do I retrain a mind out of reacting to that of experiencing?

I need a gym practice for the mind, i suppose."
1,"Does anyone know of some good talks/lectures on something similar to the following: ""Don't fear death, don't fear your boss, don't fear being separated from the ones you love, don't fear life....just put your faith in God and you'll be able to handle any situation""? When  I was really young I heard a similar speech during a religious lecture and it was very motivating for me, I was hoping someone had some recommendations on a similar mentality. 
  
The person giving the speech gave some examples, he said something like:   
&gt;&gt;**When I was growing up I didn't have the level of insecurities that I think a lot of my childhood friends growing up had. You can lose your job, your mother, your child, your significant other. You can get sick, or screamed at by a boss, or anxiety about finances.**

&gt;&gt;**I always told myself I'll put my trust in God and this gave me a very strong level of confidence because who could take god from you? Whenever I lost something I loved I would say if you're patient God will replace replace it with something better, I had a strong resilience to negative experiences because of this** 
  
Any similar talks/lectures related to Stoicism?"
1,"Stoic fluency I was anxious as a kid and angry as an adult. I'm 3 or 4 years into Stoic study now and have for some time begun to stop a bad reaction, slow down, remember my lessons and respond differently.

Without unnecessary detail, this morning I realized I had misplaced a $3000 item and it will involve a $500 deductible to replace. As I went through the house looking for it, my wife commented that she was surprised and pleased that I wasn't cursing or raving or slamming inanimate objects.

It was only then that I realized it too, because I just... was. A rational, reasonable response to a past occurrence was now simply my default. 

They say fluency is when you begin to think in the other language without first  translating your primary language. This is Stoic fluency... changed behavior that did not require a quick ""timeout"" to reset. 

A milestone in my book."
1,"Human emotion has two parts, initial emotion and then what comes after. We can’t control the initial, we can control the second part. I have come to the conclusion that all living creatures have emotions. These were giving as a survival mechanism. Good emotions = do that again, bad emotions = don’t do that again. This initial emotion is completely out of our control.

This is why your dog yelps when you accidentally step on his tail. Or why you yell when someone punches you in the face. Both are emotion. But there is a difference between you and your dog.

Dogs don’t have rational thinking, we humans do. This rational thinking is what causes our emotional pain.

Once your dog is no longer in physical pain from his tail being stepped on, he moves on as if it never even happened. If we get punched in the face, we continue thinking about the act long after the physical pain goes away. We have thoughts such as: Why did this person do this to me? They are such a terrible person for doing this to me. I must get back at them for doing this to me. And so on. 

The good news is we have full control over this second part. But it takes a lot of practice."
1,"""You should listen to your emotions, but not necessarily agree with them"" I thought about this earlier while mediating. The way I see it, you should treat your emotions like a close observer whose judgment is of great benefit, but at the end of the day, you should also be in control of your own decisions. For example, say you are afraid. It is a good thing that you've been warned of that fear and you should accept it and pay attention to it. But maybe your reasoning determines that you should act anyway, because sometimes you have to act, even with fear. Other times, you decide that your fear is justified and that avoiding the situation in place is of greater benefit.

Is this a way to interpret stoicism? Or could this reasoning be improved? Also, do you know of any quotes that more eloquently express this idea?"
1,"How do you grant yourself permission to be happy if your brain tries to not given less-than-ideal scenarios? Hi I am new around here.

I find myself with mild depression days here-and-there given minor things not working out as expected. When finally coming to terms of acceptance with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy books and reminders, my brain oddly tends to question times when I experience moments of happiness and joy; and asks “why are you happy now since nothing has changed other than perspective?” and thus I’m back to being down again.

How do you grant / allow yourself permission to feel, enjoy, and stay in a positive happy state if things in like are not “perfect” such as not being as great as they use to be, or wishing for better, and then questioning “why be happy if ____ is wrong” (even if hypothetically that (blank) isn’t something currently or easily changeable without further stressors)

1,"The path to a contented mind is during the act of helping/giving love to other humans. Not the aftermath of doing so. Why is this? Let me give you my thoughts.

As human beings we are social creatures. This was given to us as a survival mechanism. The act of socializing makes us feel good. It is during the act of socialize that we feel good, not the results of the act. 

How do I define “socializing?” I believe this is talking with fellow humans just for the sake of doing so, giving your love to fellow humans, giving an act of kindness, or helping another. 

The stoics teach us to do good and expect nothing in return. This sounds virtuous and noble and the “right thing to do.” But maybe there is something more to this.

I personally believe that the good feelings are only present during the ACT of socializing/giving love/helping others. Once the act is over, our brains return to normal. Almost as if the act itself never even took place. 

It is our rational side that continues to think about the act afterwards. If we do these things and then continue ruminating on it/expect to be repaid or expect a return in affection, we forget that the actual act itself is what gave us the good feelings.

So do your act and move on, don’t think about it, don’t expect anything in return. This way you can move forward to help, love or socialize with the next person. This way those feelings return. But remember, after the act your brain will act like this never happened. Repeat the process, and you are on your path to a contented mind."

1,"How bad is wishful thinking? I should probably clarify what I understand by the term - to me, wishful thinking is when you create some scenarios in your mind, that might happen in the future and you wish they would happen, but you can't be sure whether they will happen or not. For example - I sometimes create these awesome scenarios where I meet some nice girl that's exactly my type and I manage to go out with her. Or I imagine how I will have an amazing succes with some project I'm working on.

From what I understand about Stoicism, I suppose practicing wishful thinking is considered a bad idea. But I would like to ask how bad exactly it is. And how much should I try to get rid of such thoughts.

Thanks in advance for your advice"

1,"The wish for growth Hi there!

I'm quite new to Stoicism. Currently, I'm in therapy because of burnout and anxiety and try to get my master's thesis done. To cope with my noisy mind full of negative thoughts I started using the meditation app ""Waking up from Sam Harris"" (btw. you get free access on his website), which helped a little. Also, it had some introductory lessons about Stoicism by William B. Irvin. This was my first contact with Stoicism and I think this philosophy incorporates all the traits I wish for myself.

But at the same time I think, I am as far away from it as one can be. Because of low self-esteem, I always valued the opinion of others over mine. I was always quiet and cautious of saying the wrong thing in fear of leaving a negative impression. 

But I think what stands most in the way of finishing my thesis is the fear of not accomplishing enough. It doesn't matter if it's study-related or hobbies like playing an instrument or working out. I have always the feeling I could be better. I should be better. I easily get envious of others and start avoiding trying at all. 

In my understanding, one part of Stoicism is to accept your boundaries and work to the best of your abilities. But how do you incorporate the wish for growth? I think an accomplished Stoic knows when growth is needed and can still be satisfied with his abilities.

So, how do you get a healthy balance between these two traits or do they even contradict each other?

Thanks in advance for your input."

1,"Like exercise, Practicing virtues doesn’t always feel good. I believe it actually never feels good in the moment. But it leads to growth. View every difficult situation as training. I realized the only way to really instill these principals is to actually apply them when it matters the most.

It’s so easy to read stoicism all day and when shit hits the fan, completely forget all that you’ve learned.

It’s the uncomfortable, difficult situations that really mold us.

Ive been reminding my self that every shitty thing that happens is a training opportunity.

How can I change my perspective?

How can I show compassion, courage?

What is the right thing to do, rather than the instinctive reaction?

I realized this is harder than it seems.

Sometimes doing the right thing feels extremely uncomfortable. It’s so easy to go on autopilot and let your built in reactions take control.

It is not a glorious, happy thing to be a virtuous person - because there aren’t many.

But what i realized is after the dust settles, and you look back, you feel pride and self respect. 

You controlled yourself and no one can take that away from you."
1,"Socrates' death penalty and stoicism Long story short:
-Socrates had to kill himself for being (probably) falsely accused.
Instead of fleeing he chose to willingly accept his punishment because it would be immoral to just alter the rules.-

I know Socrates was no Stoic. But they saw him as some kind of idol.

Is his behaviour in this situation stoic in the sense of
""We should always give our best but we cannot control the outcome."" 

Wouldn't it be ""doing his best"" by taking action to avoid his clearly unnecessary and unfair death?

I would like to compare this to people with a serious illness.
To my understanding this would mean one shouldn't take himself into the best medical care and just accept dying?

In my mind I wouldn't consider this giving my best. It would fall under the aspect of resignation. Something stoics are mentioned NOT being.

Later, when I was writing a seminar paper on stoicism, I connected most of the principles to stoicism. I thought sharing them with you.

1. Know what is and what is not in your control. Do not control what is not in your control
2. Be and do what you want others to be and do. Do not expect them to be and do what you want them to be and do.
3. Do not judge others. They have their own reasons. They live their own life.
4. Do not respond to others judging you. As long as you are not purposefully hurting them, it is them and not you, do not let it become you.
5. Without your reaction, everything is powerless.
6. Try to look at all the sides. Do not worship, but if you do, look at it from all perspectives.
7. Life is not a problem to be solved but a reality to be experienced. You do not know shit, you will never know shit, just dance and enjoy the show, love and care and love and care will come.

Hope it will help anyone. Peace, love, WATN"

(Disclaimer: I’m not here to invalidate depression or mental illness, having suffered myself I know that each battle is different for everyone and I’m just here to offer my story and some advice which helped me!) 

Coming from someone who has been on multiple antidepressants over the years and insisting that nothing worked for me (I was just a hopeless wreck), I found the painful yet rewarding path to feeling ok again, all by myself. I’d get angry at the thought of people telling me to just “go outside!” or “try new hobbies” I thought how can they possibly understand, I felt misunderstood and angry at the world. After coming out of a relationship with someone who I was convinced was my soulmate I decided I needed to change, not for them but for my future, I’d spent so long feeling like a helpless victim and I couldn’t do this to myself anymore for the sake of my future sanity and relationships. It was hard accepting that I was the main character in my life and not just a side character in theirs (sad, I know but it gets sad when you’re sad). It began with simple acts like just appreciating the shower I was in, or the warm bed yet I knew I was still burning up inside with regret, anger, hatred, resentment and about every emotion you could imagine. I tried so hard to appreciate these things but I knew that in a heartbeat I’d rather have things back how they were. It was exhausting, my mind was clouded and confused, so many unanswered questions and theories about the past plagued me everyday about how someone I trusted could let me down so badly. It would have been so easy to give up on trying completely and just let the ground consume me and in the first few weeks, each second was agony but nevertheless I persisted with what I could, I had no other choice. I knew that my goal was to become unphased by “could’ve, should’ve, would’ve” and to trust what nature laid out for me but I knew it would be a harsh reality for me to accept at the time. I began my own journey into Philosophy after speaking with a friend who introduced me to stoicism, this was something I could freely research without feeling the regret and pain this relationship breakdown had given me, something I could claim as my own without being hindered by their presence, it really was like being set free from the pain. 

I began by telling myself that progress isn’t a straight line, you cannot simply drop emotions you’ve relied on for years in a single day and at first I felt like a failure to Stoicism because I simply could not do what it required of me. I couldn’t help the burning nausea, pain and anger when thinking about people who had “wronged” me, the deep and embarrassing regret of my past continued to eat me up hour by hour but I kept a list of quotes from Meditations (recommended by a friend!) which helped me move past those emotions specific to my situation. Day after day it became easier and much quicker than you’d expect, of course I have moments why I fantasize about the past and how things could’ve gone but Ive let 90% of it go, something I thought I’d never be able to do. It’s ok if you’re not the perfect Stoic I think, as long as you have the common goal to benefit yourself by letting go of what you cannot control. Each time I’d have a question about the past (a “What if?” Or “Why did...?” or “How could...?”) I would say out loud “Why does it matter? It doesn’t exist.”

Marcus Aurelius quotes which are helpful in these situations: 
“We suffer more often in imagination than in reality”

“If it doesn’t challenge you then it won’t change you”

“The stronger the wind, the stronger the trees” 


Enough about me...
Many people have turned to Stoicism after tragedy or prolonged battles with mental health. It can seem easy to slip into old ways of giving up on the world and believing that there’s nothing more for you here anymore but remembering that you’re here whether you like it or not is a harsh truth. Loathing yourself, feeling bad and feeling all kinds of unhelpful emotions is tiring, painful and ultimately will be the end of you. Learning to have faith in the future, faith in your actions and faith in what the world hands you is a hard task after many years of seemingly being constantly let down by nature. Hardships are a lesson from the earth, use them to your advantage or let them by your downfall, either way is a challenge but you have to decide which challenge to take on. 
I have complied some quotes (once again from meditations!) which are particularly helpful when overcoming doubt within yourself to reach a stoic state (as one could say?)

“Something happens to you? Good. It was meant for you by nature, woven into the pattern from the beginning”

“You can’t lose the past or future because how can you lose what you don’t have?
All you have in life is the present moment.
Stop giving up your present moments to the past”

“Treat what you don’t have as nonexistent. Look at what you have, the things you  value most, and think of how much you’d crave them if you didn’t have them. But be careful. Don’t feel such satisfaction that you start to overvalue them —that it would upset you to lose them”

Finding Purpose...
When people asked me what I thought my purpose was I’d think it was a silly question. I have no purpose I thought to myself, only to be happy but over the past week (yes, that recent...) I have made up my mind on what I would like to do in life. I have a career goal for the first time ever and I know that armed with this mindset I will not have to worry about whether it works out or not as I know I will be ok. Having a drive in life has made me remove myself from meaningless and unhelpful thoughts. Having the purpose in mind however, acts as a clever distraction to fantasizing about the past, a future goal to focus your mind on rather than a past to negatively reflect on.

Attachment is, at the light of Stoicism, the source of unhappiness. Why? We'll get there.

So, in short, the world is in a constant state of change. Things come and things go. They get released. Simply because they are not yours. The only thing you own is Reason. Reason and the power of reasoning. Don't mistake this. You may 'have' a nice car, a nice home, a nice partner, a nice phone; You may even aspire to have such things. Is there a problem? No. But a catch: they are not yours, so if your home burns down, if your car crashes, if your phone gets stolen, don't get mad. They are not yours anyway.

I see now that these companies take the most shiny and appealing concepts of Stoicism and manipulate the newcomers wishing to seek out the teachings of the Stoics. 

Typically when there is a newcomer to Stoicism, they have experienced some sort of tragic event that leads them here. This is when they are most vulnerable and susceptible to try ANYTHING to fix the horrible feelings they are having. This has them eating out of the palm of these companies/peoples hands. And then they are led to believe these companies know the true teachings of Stoicism but unfortunately they are being led down the wrong path. These companies do not care about you, they care about your money. Do not fall for the trap. This also applies to some books, YouTube videos, etc. 

They prey on you when you are most vulnerable to get you to buy their book or click their YouTube video for views. It’s all about money. True Stoic thought is to shun wealth. These people are after money, this is the opposite of the teachings of the Stoics. In this way you are being taught by people who do not practice what they preach. This is a dangerous road to go down. 

Be careful what information you come across and what information you take in. I know you are hurting and are vulnerable. But this is the exact point where is easiest for people to manipulate you for their own gain."

1,"A lesson from my pupper IM A NEWBIE, LOOKING TO DISCUSS AND LEARN! 

Sitting on the couch, scrolling through the mindless and endless black holes of tik tok and Instagram, my little dog hopped up and snuggled right up next to me. I couldn’t help but smile. 

Then I thought about it, why does a dog’s love mean so much to me? Because it is UNCONDITIONAL and without ulterior motives. 

My anxiety comes a lot from what I think others are thinking when they’re with me. Whether I’m watching a movie with my girlfriend and worried I’m boring her to death or feeling like friends have better things to do than to be with me and would rather be elsewhere, but stay out of pity for me . It causes me to push a lot of people away and it’s a huge reason why I’ve tried to start learning more about stoicism, in this regard about learning what is and isnt under my control. 

Here’s where the lesson comes in: my dog does not care about my emotions. At least in the way that most people do. My dog, when she hopped up on the couch and curled up next to me, WANTED TO BE THERE, and I knew that for a fact. Why? Because if she didn’t want to be there, she wouldn’t have come. 

I’ve always loved animals, and I think it’s for this reason. They wear their hearts on their sleeves, so I never have to worry and stress about what they’re feeling or thinking on the inside. I think I need to just see everyone the same way as I see my dog. Because frankly, in the eyes of nature, all creatures do what they’re meant to do and go where they’re meant to go. And being worried about someone worrying about making ME happy is a ridiculous burden to take.

1,"Struggling in an online friendship I don’t know what to do. My best friend (online) is a high school student and is often busy. She has been mentioning lately the fact that we cannot call much and how it sucks. Despite, I refuse to believe that she actually has the will to talk with me over the phone. 

She had an hour spare time, however, I was about to have dinner. ‘I have 5 minutes before I have dinner’ I said, ‘let’s talk?’ ‘Oh no’ she replied, ‘5 minutes is not long enough.
 ‘Isn’t a short call better than no call?’ I asked. She doesn’t think so. ‘I rather not call at all than talk a little,’ she stated. 

Lately she has rejected the opportunities we have had to talk and has been only asking to call when she knows it’s my bed time. She knows that sleep is really important to me and when it’s time I ought to do nothing but sleep. However, many times have I stayed up late, waiting for her, to talk. I would use up my sleeping time to speak with her. When we do talk I would try to keep it short but despite my efforts she’ll keep talking the call will last at least an hour. 

It really feels like to me that she doesn’t want to talk and that she purposely asks at my bed time since she knows I’ll either say ‘I can’t now’ or ‘a short one because I’m about to sleep’ which she won’t bother a short call. Neither do i think that she appreciates the fact that I have sacrificed sleep with her. I tried to communicate with her politely yet I received tempered response. I’m always the bad guy. Things alike happens from time to time, then it will stop and she’ll cease behaving like this. Sometimes she apologised and sometimes she doesn’t. 

There’s not often dramas like this but from time to time it occurs. Usually we are okay and are on the same page for most things, but not in instances like these. I suppose the simple answer is accept what I cannot control and only be concerned with that which I can control. That aside, I don’t know how to handle it."
1,"""You're just what I was looking for."" I was doing my reading this morning and came across this quote. It's Marcus Aurelius 7.68. People quote him all the time all over the internet, but I've never seen this one mentioned, and I think it's one of the better quotes I've heard from him so far.

""...So that Judgement can look at the event in the eye and say, 'this is what you really are, regardless of what you may look like.' While Adaptability adds, 'You're just what I was looking for.' Because to me the present is a chance for the exercise of rational virtue..."" 

I just thought this was such a great reminder, and something that we can all keep in our minds, despite the situation we're in. It's just what we were looking for, because we had no other choice but to look for it."

1,"I have only just a minute. A wonderful poem by Dr. Benjamin E. Mays. &gt;I have only just a minute,  
Only sixty seconds in it.  
Forced upon me, can’t refuse it.  
Didn’t seek it, didn’t choose it.  
But it’s up to me  
to use it.  
I must suffer if I lose it.  
Give account if I abuse it.  
Just a tiny little minute,  
but eternity is in it.

1,"Can’t escape past thoughts. Can having a stoic mindset in the present help? I thought some stoics might be able to shed light on this.

I’ve always thought it’s bad to run from your past but I’ve tried to heal these thoughts for so long.

My life was great until about 15, started hanging round people where alcohol, drugs, violence, bullying/being nasty, unhealthy lifestyle until my early 20s.

I now look back at those times and think wow I went so off track where I was suppose to go, but  when my friends went to this group so did I. Kind of ruined my life.

Now I’ve moved city and cut them off as much as possible although not in a obvious way.

I’ve made new AMAZING friends, my lifestyle is so much healthier and I’m striving to be the best version of myself.

But I simply can’t erase the memories of some of those feelings from years ago.

Is it best for me to just focus on the present and they will hopefully fade?



TLDR: Present life is great but overshadowed by past memories that I can’t get away from. Is it possible to just focus on the present and they will fade?"
1,"You can’t lose what you don’t own :) **“You cannot really lose anything because you don’t own anything in the first place. Not the stuff you have, nor your spouse, nor your property. They are given to you for temporary keep. So never say, “I have lost something.” You just returned it. Your spouse died? (S)he was returned. You have lost your property? You returned it. What if a thief stole your things? What does it matter to you who took what doesn’t really belong to you?

1,"How to Effectively Embody Stoicism? (esp. for a self-help junkie like me)   

Hello,

   
 

I am new to Stoicism and I am a bit worried that I might just become so satisfied with reading and learning Stoicism but fail to embody it.

 

Can you suggest any book on Stoicism especially related to taking action or embodying it?   
 

(You may respond to this already, without reading the next lines.)

 

But if you want to continue, allow me to share my self-help journey so far.

   
 

I am 19 years old; it was March when lockdowns have started in our country. I am an undergraduate student. I was just into that state of pursuing my degree painstakingly. I was studious, but I only had been studying fields related to my course/program. 

When that quite long 'free time' during the start of lockdown came, I started to question if I am really on the right path. So I started searching about GOALS, and PURPOSE IN LIFE. I became so addicted to it. I kept on searching on and on about HOW TO SUCCEED IN LIFE. Mostly those things are on YouTube. I realized that I was just academically inclined; that I haven't touched this very important aspect of my life until that time: the real world. I just noticed all my imperfections, my deficiencies. 

So I kept on searching again and again. Watching summaries of this and that self-help book. It went on until August (5 months, got a little intro to Stoicism near the end of July). One morning that time I realized, ""Hey! I haven't seen any improvement!"". I realized that knowledge is good, but it's not enough if you don't take action.

   
 

Our online class started in September. I got depressed. I haven't made a significant improvement in myself. I blamed myself for not being able to realize it after a month, or even after 2 months. I've wasted 5 months of my life thinking I was significantly improving. I even thought I was ahead of my peers (stupid!). Reality slapped me! I'm now having a hard time dealing with academics; I also blamed myself for this. If only I had spent those 5 months studying in advance for this semester (which I used to do), I wouldn't experience this much struggle. I blamed myself. But some Stoic quotes have helped me deal with it. Stoicism is helping me deal with everything I'm facing right now. I also think that among those self-help books and videos, Stoicism is the superior one (I decided to stop searching for new self-help ideas when I stumbled upon Stoicism, although I didn't read a lot about Stoicism immediately after that because I started reading those resources I've gathered first).

After all those frustrations, I am still grateful that I’m now introduced to Stoicism. If I hadn’t done it, I probably would have just studied academic books. Yes, it could have probably helped me a lot for this semester; but stumbling upon Stoicism would probably help me not just this year but especially for the rest of my life."
1,"Some thoughts by the rambling man..thank you for listening Im kind of happy about covid. Its made me resilliant yet fearless. This sub has offered me so much help, i am going to start practing it as of right now. 

So I started writing today finally, i've waited years to release all the pain..but sadly it took something as full of horror ,as this pandemic is, to straighten me up, so anyway..If we always had our body and mind we wouldn't know the fragility of the said subject. We are literally ticking time bombs so why not live life stoically religous not feeding into toxicity.  

Everything is fleeting and its all happening right in front of us. I say be ready for whatever happens in this crazy world. Crazy people are everywhere. The consumer culture and media along with big tech has ruined more lives maybe then it seems to have maybe helped, yet what makes a stoic a good one? well a tough world is sure enough to have some very very tough people. People have stories that I would love to hear. Everyone in this world is just so cold, especially these day.  Stoics will get through this pandemic just fine.

I got past my depression and suicidal thoughts that i wouldn't act on  because of stoicism and if someone is reading this who is sees this attempt being a stoic. my advice is to do it. What do you have to lose? I wish this subject was taught in school but why isn't it? Uprisings... everything is so tightly controlled by who every owns this world. History is written by the victor, yet the world could be a paradise if only living heavenly life was the only requirement to live so why not live virtuously as long as you can. but I hope theres peace after this life, ""death is but a mirage"". Stay strong everyone! 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for listening. Be a stoic beast fellas. Our lives are fleeting and were dying every day. Stay strong! Love yourself!

Here are 5 Stoic Principles to Build Self-Confidence and a quote from Seneca

Source: [https://www.howtobeast.com/stoic-principles/](https://www.howtobeast.com/stoic-principles/)

 **Seneca** wrote “We are dying every day,” and all the days we have lived up to now are “already in the hands of **death**.” Stop whatever you're doing for a moment and ask yourself: Am I afraid of **death** because I won't be able to do this anymore? Yet another was to be never afraid of **death** or how we **die**

1,"Stoicism for Beginners Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm introduced to Stoicism a few months ago. I've watched videos and read some quotes. I now have two books which I bought a week ago; 'The Daily Stoic' and 'Stoicism: The Art of Happiness'. I find the former easy to go with, and is actionable. The latter is somewhat like an academic introduction to Stoicism (perhaps just for me, I've finished the first chapter just now). I am aware that I'm just starting out. Do you have any advice so that I can optimally improve my knowledge of Stoicism? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I plan to buy  

1. Epictetus' Enchiridion (idk if there are different versions, but if so, I hope you can suggest one)
2. Marcus Aurelius' Meditations (please suggest a/an translation/author for those people like me who are new to Stoicism)
3. Seneca's Letters

I'm nearly 20, I also feel like having an existential crisis and Stoicism somehow helps me deal with it. My learning curve is steep. I also find  ""Growth Mindset Kit"" by Big Life Journal very helpful (I introduce it to my younger siblings, it's for ages 5-11, but, unashamedly, I am actually learning a lot. It's somewhat Stoic."
1,"Stoic Thoughts: When a chapter in a book ends you don’t kick up a fuss that you may never see a chapter as good as that again, you just trust the author to continue the story. I think much of non-Stoic’s imaginary stress is caused by looking back on memories and worrying for the future (EG: after a break up or divorce, worrying you’ll never find a partner as good as they were or losing a job and wondering whether you’ll find another as well paying and with people you like). I think this is because people don’t trust the process of nature, Marcus Aurelius wrote how chronic pain is endurable and if it isn’t then it will be over at some point anyway (basically anything is endurable and if it’s not, then you won’t have to deal with it) and that’s nature’s way of writing the story (bonus: everything is alright in the end because we all end up in the same place!). When you read a book you don’t get angry at one chapter ending, you just keep reading and I think it’s a good analogy for stoicism. Stoicism is about putting your trust in nature’s story telling, this in turn will help you lead a much less stressful life."
1,"Advice on relationships I recently got into the best institute of my country and my program is direct Ph.D and I am 23 years old.

The workload is too much. Every week I have 4 tests apart from assignment I have to complete and day long headaches have become common part of my life.

Amidst all this, I look to my gf for support. Is that wrong? Should I be self reliant because I cant control how she reacts?

The reason I am posting this is because of an argument I had yesterday with her. It was 1 in the night. She had gone to a family function and she was upset that I didnt even ask if she reached safely, when will she be back etc.

But I told her the reason I didnt was because I didnt even leave my desk the whole day. And during the time of argument, my right knee was in pain(got hurt during the exercise) my eyes couldnt stay open, my head was aching so bad and I was tired. I didnt shout at her or lose my temper but it broke my heart when she said that it doesnt even bother her if I ask her or not. 

The main cause of my pain is that she knows I have regular panic attacks because of the workload, I am unable to sleep at night, my head aches constantly and my body is in pain all the time then why can't she be more understanding? 
Am I wrong here?
If yes, then how should I view this?

Tl;dr: My desire for my gf to be a loving caring girl causes me pain. But I think that if I detach myself then it would lead to the end of the relationship. So how can I love without getting attached to her or exprcting love and care in return?"
1,"What translation of Discourses is easiest to read? I have read both Meditations and Letters From A Stoic. I very easily understood the lessons in each. The next book on my list was to read the Discourses. I bought an audiobook version translated by George Long on audible. It was a duel book with the Echiridion &amp; Discourses. I previously read the Echiridion and followed it easily. But this audiobook version I realized I couldn’t really follow it well. I am having a hard time grasping this one because the translation has a lot of words that are not quite in my vocabulary. I really don’t want to keep going to google to find what each word means, I feel it takes away from the flow of the lessons. Does anyone have suggestions for which translation would be easiest to follow? Preferably in audiobook form, I work a job that requires me to drive a lot so I would like to be able to listen while working. Thanks in advance."
1,"The pleasure from Consumption Mindset and Productive Mindset.  There are two types of pleasure, the pleasure of consumption and pleasure of production. The pleasure of consumption is basically consuming media, books, art, food, etc. By pleasure of production, I mean producing some output, creating something, getting something accomplished or achieving some goal. 

When we are too engrossed in consumption, the productive mindset feels repulsive. At that point, we just want to stick to our screens for hours, listen to music, keep eating and keep trying to escape from our productive side.

To experience the pleasure of a productive mindset we have to completely shun the mindset of consumption for many of us can not balance between both. We need to shut off our TVs and PCs, cancel the streaming service subscription, block addictive websites. We can experience the same or even more pleasure from our productive mindset."

(e.g. Traumatic events have already happened and they are not in one's control) but I find myself trying to remind myself that people aren't just disregarding my personal trauma. However a close friend of mine that I shared this book with has started saying things like trauma doesn't matter. And it's getting really hurtful. It feels like he's using the book to disregard my feelings or put himself above me since he's finished the book and I haven't yet... I'm curious to know what experienced/practicing stoics feel about how this book discusses trauma."

1,How would you describe Stoicism in one sentence? 
1,"Stoicism as a mid-life crisis. I am 41, a father and a husband with kids. By trade I am a web developer. This past year I found the Stoics through one of Ryan Holidays books. It has led me down a road that seems to be making things better in my life. I am calmer, I have started a daily journal and have started the process of reducing my anxiety medications. I had someone come to me the other day and say that all of this is just a mid-life crisis on my part. My response was one of humor, ""At least its not fake breasts and a Corvette"". But it got me to thinking about why people would view a move to better my soul as a ""crisis"". Why belittle something which seems to be improving someone? (Note: I say that with full knowledge that I am not Seneca or Epictetus or Marcus and have a long LONG way to go.)

I am just curious if anyone else has met with this reaction? What reaction would you suggest?"
1,"How do you reconcile Stoicism with injustice? I am not a Stoic. But I am familiar with their ethics. I am a philosophy major, so naturally I have read/discussed them a lot. Despite this, I have never found a good response to the objection that Stoics perpetuate oppression and injustice by deeming certain circumstances as externals when in fact these circumstances are within the agents control. 
For example: it might appear to a stoic slave that they will never be freed. If this is their perception (that their slavery is inevitable— an external— out of their control) then the slave believes that fighting for their freedom is irrational, unnatural and therefore a moral bad. But what if they are wrong about their slavery? What if it is possible to become a free person and they just misjudged? I would even take it a step further and say that even if they KNEW it was impossible to be freed, it would still be better for them to attempt escape. 
The Stoic would respond to this by saying that to attempt something impossible is irrational but I would argue 2 things: 
     1. It isn’t good to be complicit in an oppressive system. To chalk up institutional oppression to “external” circumstance is to perpetuate the oppression and potentially make it harder for those who can escape to do so.
      2. It’s more irrational to act in a way that contradicts my values. To live as a slave contradicts some pretty fundamental beliefs that I have. Therefore it would be more rational just to die or suffer the consequences of my actions (attempted escape etc etc) EVEN IF I knew those actions to be impossible. 

tldr: Stoicism seems very problematic to me. It seems like a dangerous philosophy because it can be used for victim blaming."
1,"Passion and romanticism in stoicism I was wondering if anyone can enlighten me on this, Ive only read the encheiridion and a couple other texts on stoicism, but I've come across something I cant quite figure out for myself. I get that emotion is fine, especially when you might use it to fuel action that you consider virtuous, but I wonder if enjoying emotion simply for the sake of enjoying emotion could be considered stoic. If I read Frankenstein and revel in the dark and foreboding feelings or the overall sense of anguish that the book exudes, I am doing nothing that helps anyone other than just enjoying myself. I might consider that moment of enjoyment of those emotions as a preferred indifferent but I am not quite sure if I could bundle that in there. Can one be a romantic or passionate simply for the sake of experiencing those emotions and still be stoic? I think that the conjuring of those emotions is mostly up to me and I could shut that off it became to much, but can I still enjoy it and be stoic at the same time?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks"
1,"Stoicism and religion? Just curious if anyone on here is follows any specific religion due to the fact that Stoicism had a great deal of influence on the Abrahamic religions, and specifically Christianity which adopted a lot of its ethics and also some of its physics, primarily in relation to God (the Holy Spirit/pneuma for example)"
1,"Meditations and the fight with my wife. Stoicism is for everyone. Stoicism did not forsee the internet. Everyday we remind ourselves that we may die tomorrow, and that we love our fate. And despite the origin of this story, stoicism has helped me. Stoicism is not about perfection, it's about the road we walk.

This story is stoic, but unlike Marcus it starts with a meme.

A facebook group the wife and I are in is pretty trashy. Which is fun and dumber than a country carnival. The problem is, this group gravitates the worst folks on the internet. Classic.

A man posts a meme about cougars at bars being sluts. Not very cool. She tells me ""I think I might leave this group, there's a lot of this crap on here and it's not cool."" 

I take a look. Disgusting.

""Do you want to really stop this?"" I ask. She says yes. Lets say she's a few drinks in, and the alcohol in her equates her to a toddler. It's hard to watch, and usually she just falls asleep.

I craft a meme that uses 2 layers of sarcasm with an honesty this gentleman wasn't ready to read. This man has lived a lie for l
10 years that I threw onto the table with my meme. 

Although the 100+ comments of offended, and 'triggered' humans, this meme post hit him right in the chest. 5 minutes after posting it, he deleted the meme. Truly a victory in the meme world.

I told her there's an incredible power in humility, that this gentleman has realized the last decade of his life could have been different, and it's likely he intends to become a better person. A victory for him and the world. I am proud of what we could accomplish.

Although this group intentionally tries to offend each other, he writes an apology.

She decides to post my meme on the group. Aggressively. Stuffing the image in the faces of everyone. And tries to throw this meme at his apology. This defeats everything we worked for.

When someone admits wrong, we welcome them in open arms. And we make them a friend. They need that more than ever. Forbid that we hold our victory over their head, there we find hate.

That's what she wanted, and being the drunk toddler that my wife became, we disagreed. This is my meme, it did the job, it's done. So I grabbed her phone and deleted the meme.

Then later upon continued assault, I removed her from the group. 

This is not a good look. I look like a controlling husband. An obvious asshole. 

I did so because I love her. Because she changed someone's life for the better, and she was destroying that with her out of mind attack. Attacking a man who admitted wrong?

We fought. I said nothing but the obvious. She had a good point, I took her device and removed herself from the group then gave it back. That is the demand of an evil man. A man who needs to control another person. Only a disgusting controlling man would do that.

I knew by tomorrow morning the admin of the group would simply add her back.

I became the worst person imaginable. And the fodder came in. I am the worst person imaginable, and I deserve to die alone.  Things were thrown at me.

That's fine.

During my beration I took a moment to remind myself about life. That one day I will die, and that I love my fate, and that I love her.

She showed me my Christmas presents she got me. All incredible, all things I had no idea I needed. Probably the best gift anyone has ever gotten me. And proceeded to throw them in the trash.

After that, I meditated.

Then I left my house, and had some time to think and send this message to you all. And thanks for everything.

Life is hard. I love it, and I love you all for the clarity you bring to me everyday. Be honest about your reality, and that will help someone else be honest to us.

I hope you're doing well."

In an argument where the bad guy is unclear, blame gets shifted and tossed until the majority find someone to take all the fault and move on. Narratives are constructed that “feel good” to people and the truth that was never looked for is lost forever. 

In my particular situation, I looked for a compromise wherein both parties could admit their mistakes. I yearned for validation of my points saying “ i admit my role, but you played a role as well”. They were ignored and met with “well you did x and y in the past, so this situation must’ve been your fault as well. I think we should stop being friends”. The context stopped mattering. Even if I wasnt guilty i was perceived as guilty because it was the easier option to them. The context no longer mattered. 

It’s the hardest thing in the world for people to admit culpability. It’s not in some people’s interests to look for the truth, they want a narrative that feels good. If you want a stoic lifestyle, find yourself friends that can take accountability or they will walk on you. 

To be labeled as “that angry guy” when it was easier than admitting any fault, they want me so bad to become the narrative that they created. They would be thrilled if I became the embodiment of it. I say don’t acknowledge people like that. The moment someone has categorized you into a folder where you’ve lost credibility before you’ve even began talking, take a long look at them and think about that relationship. Some people don’t want you to be stoic. They would never want to admit you’re level headed, because it doesn’t fit their narrative. Don’t take the bait."
1,"I want to be a stoic, but everything feels wrong. There can’t be a Logos. I feel uncomfortable in my own body. The future is dark. I feel like I don’t even know who I am. I’m 16, a sophomore in high school. I picked up a copy of Mediations recently and it’s put everything into perspective. My concerns are paramount, I shouldn’t care. I can’t help but care. Slowly, though, I am readjusting. 

Soon I’ll get a job; some of my friends have jobs already. For fifty years or more my labor will be subject to the will and gain of some corporate hedonist. People are dying more than ever. Pestilence runs rampant and those in power don’t care; what do we matter? We’re below them. I shouldn’t care, I need to take it in stride. 

Among all this, the biggest problem I have is forcing myself to believe there’s some magnanimous, perfect structure to it all: the Logos. Marcus goes on and on about the Logos. It’s so important, a facet of stoicism. An interweaving foundation of everything ever, and it’s supposedly perfect. This is the perfect structure? Perfect? I’m expected to believe that this is everything? The rest of my life consumed by labor while those in power profit, and innocents below them die? 

I suppose I sympathize with the Epicureans. Everything’s arbitrary, and that’s why none of it matters. I don’t want to think like that, though. I’ve always been a nihilistic person, and I don’t want to be anymore. I want to reject this view point, but I simply can’t free myself from it. I want the Logos to be real so bad but it’s just not. Perhaps someone wiser than I can convince me. I’m not sure.

Whatever, soon I’ll be dead, and all this won’t matter."

1,how did you discover stoicism and how did it change your life? title. really interested in how people came about this philosophy and how it influenced their lives when they implemented its teachings. was it positive or negative. did your mindset change as a whole. do you believe you are better than you were before finding stoicism?
1,"Where to begin? hoping to change my life by changing my mindset hello everyone. after having come across the philosophy of stoicism through numerous youtube videos and authors such as ryan holiday i felt quite drawn to it as a whole. I'm not sure if its the novelty of finding out something new or what but I'm truly interested in its practice and its potential benefit in improving my own life.

i am a late 20's male. i have lived my entire life in fear riddled with constant depression and anxiety. as a teenager i was depressed most of the time and could not tell anyone, also i would also be scared/nervous all the time and as a young adult i realised it was anxiety. these two emotions ruled my life and governed every decision i have ever made. now its not that i didn't manage to get anywhere. i went to school, became a professional in a career many would be proud to be in and others impressed by. its just the difficulty these emotions cause in my day to day life. simple tasks becoming difficult. fear of the unknown, fear of the future, irrational fears of things i cannot possibly know or control and i feel it has truly limited my ability to live life to its fullest.

2020 has been a challenging year for many of us. personally,  i was unable to find a job (and still haven't) this was partly due to covid and partly due to fear and anxiety on my part. I've also had a myriad of health issues which were bad enough for me to consider the possibility that i may not make it to the year 2021. now that I'm feeling better I've noticed a change in my overall personality in a positive way. i look back at things i was scared off and wonder why, looked at things i didn't do because of fear and wondered why. so many regrets as such a young individual and it scared me too my core that i may never get to experience life as many others do.

now i understand that stoicism cannot cure an underlying medical condition and stop anxiety issues. however, i do believe that it may provide me with a mindset that will be beneficial and conducive to living the life i truly want to live. one without fear but purpose, drive and happiness. I'm ready to take life into my own hands now, and if i don't act i know my mind will slip back into its old ways.

so if anyone can guide me on how an individual with no prior knowledge on stoicism and what it entails can start and how it can influence my life i will really appreciate it."
1,"New to stoicism A good friend of mine recommended I look into stoicism- so here I am. In a nutshell, what does stoicism mean to you and what are the impacts it has had on your life?"
1,"Stoicism can fuel my shadow sometimes When I read maxims about not committing acts of evil and to always act out of virtue, I often find myself suppressing my evil, which in turn gets pulled into my shadow, which makes me it all 10 times stronger. Another one could be my lust for revenge; if I want to harm somebody who wronged me and I try to logically pull myself out of it, that lust turns 10 times stronger and I want to harm that person more than ever. Have you ever considered that the case that certain stoic practices in fact fuels your shadow?"
1,"Can you be happy without becoming the best version of yourself? A few dear friends of mine do seem happy and fulfilled. However, they do now live a virtuous life in the Stoical sense. They give it their best at work, but they limit the efforts to their weekly 40 hours. Apart from those weekly 40 hours, they do not spend any time improving themselves or becoming better versions of themselves. They spend all their non-work time hanging out with friends and family, playing videogames, playing sports, etc. They invest no time in reading books or learning new skills. 

From how I understand Stoicism, this cannot lead to a happy and fulfilled life. Yet, they seem like the most happy people I know. They seem carefree and enjoying their lives to the fullest. 

I'm inquisitive about the Stoic views on people like them. Do they have a happy life in the Stoic sense? Or could they be even more content? How? Because Stoicism is about a happy life, not a perfect life. 

Thank you for any thoughts you share!"

1,"Being emotionless is not the goal The quality of a good character doesn't lie in not feeling external pain, not feeling emotions, not feeling when bad external things happen to us.

Instead, it's about translating and “judging” the emotions, feelings, and natural movements of the soul in a way that is morally good and rational.

Only a psychopath could be indifferent about losing a loved one or about millions of people dying in COVID all over the world.

It’s how you translate those emotions.

Life runs its course and some things in life will necessarily create negative feelings and impulses. What makes the difference is judging those feelings correctly and putting them into the right framework.

When things are not under our control, they are indifferent. We don't care, we don’t judge. When things are our control, we take the correct action. We think the right thoughts. We act like we should, in the present.

1,"What's the Stoic response to feeling like people are walking all over you? Hello Stoic community,

So what should I do when I don't feel like I can stand up for myself or my values because I feel like I'm being walked over? Because everytime I try and make a stand, I'll get the ""what are you going to do about it"" response and I feel like I'm left with 2 options. I can either try to ""be the bigger man"" and start intensifying the situation, or I can just let it go, which roots me in the problem further. The issue I have with the first option is that I feel like I can't really do anything, because I know from Stoic teachings that I can't change how someone is going to behave, only how I react to that behavior. I don't feel like I'm afraid to make a stand, I just don't feel like it would do anything. Sure I could keep asserting myself, but that's all I feel like I could ever do. And then the problem with the second problem seems self-explanatory, I'll be digging the hole even further down. So, what would be the appropriate Stoic response here, because I'm at a brick wall?

Thank you in advance for your responses."

1,"How to deal with being wronged by my brother My brother has a lot of positive qualities, though he is also domineering, manipulative, and controlling. He's been like this our whole lives. Generally, everything was fine between us because I kept him at some distance. 

Some time ago, he wronged me. I thought the best thing was to talk with him in the open. I plainly and mostly calmly told him that what he was doing was wrong while it was happening. I told him that what he did was wrong after it happened. Nothing. He was too busy to talk, too upset, non-responsive, pretending that nothing was wrong, denying everything, pretending that it's my fault for being angry, etc. Nothing even close to an apology or acknowledging that what he did was wrong. 

What is a Stoic way to deal with this or move forward? If it was anybody else, I would just drop contact with them and move on. I've pretty much done the same here, but since he is my brother, I feel that I cannot stop all contact. There are family functions, etc, when we must interact. 

I get angry when I think about the situation. Angry at what he did. Perhaps even more angry at myself for not being able to stop him in the moment. He is difficult to stop because of his controlling personality -- the ""frame"" that he has always had is that he always gets what he wants no matter what. 

IF he had apologized after the fact, it would have been something, maybe. Or maybe not -- I would have just felt like a weak b* who got thrown an apology as scraps. But he hasn't even done that! He has refused to even acknowledge that there was anything wrong - he is pretending that he has no idea why I am upset. 

Should I move on with nothing, not even an apology? The thing is not just about the past -- it's his personality, and he will get me again. So I am justifying my anger by telling myself that if I am not angry, then I have to pretend everything is normal. But if I pretend everything is normal, our relationship will improve, he will wrong and manipulate me again."

1,"Thought about anger I had in my journal I struggle with anger, and people who I see as ""annoying"" at times which I shouldn't do. 

I'm relatively new to stoicism, but I felt happy about this I wrote. Tell me that you think of it, and holes in my logic (so hopefully I and maybe some others who need it can learn). 

--

When someone or something is about to anger you, or vex you, firstly think you yourself, ""what virtue can I use to overcome this, which would be a mark of good fortune?"" 

Also realize that this does not matter. We forget, and life will inevitably go on. By being angered by this, you are letting externals, both men and gods, manipulate you and throw you around; you are putting York happiness in the hands of others. 

You just accept it and now, think objectively. You know there are certainly those in society whom, at times, act irrationally or unjustly for the believe it will acquire them that which is of worth to them, more than virtue--and this you cannot control. Did you expect everyone to be perfect, for this to never happen to you? So why let it surprise you, then? 

""But I thought I knew this person, this is unlike them.""

Well of you expected them to never change and be static forever, then you are a fool; for this would give them tenfold more integrity and grounding than that which you seek--that of a sage. 

""But this keeps happening, over and over, and especially now I cannot deal with this."" 

But does this keep you from practicing virtue, living a smoothly flowing life, disturb your happiness and tranquility?

 If the answer is yes, then that is fortunate, so long you see this as an opportunity to reflect inward, accepting the past and your past mindset. To act virtuously once again, to act objectively and learn from the past. 

If the answer is no, then this too is fortunate--for you have passed another test of your virtue and from this you can learn also.

My question is does stoicism have to make you boring, or more so than before?"
1,"Stoicism on Friendship and Having Best Friends For the past months I’ve been experiencing this near-nihilistic approach towards many things that occurred in my life. I even extended this to my friends especially during their birthdays. I wished them a happy birthday and later told them it’s nothing special, because everyone has a birthday. 

On November 21, this “belief” bit me back when I felt lonely when very few of my buddies text/call to wish me a happy birthday. By few I mean 2/10 close circles that I currently have. I’m not saying that the reason they forgot/don’t wanna wish is because how I treated their birthday. That was just a banter on my half and they know it. We share jokes this way. 

Now maybe I should not care much about this that seem petty but as someone who considered this group of people as my close circles, I can’t help to get disappointed for not getting a simple wish or an acknowledged on my “special day”. 

In the end, I ended up getting a facial massage alone.

For a little background, I think of myself as a mostly logical person. I can grapple with the concept of death and tell myself that my days are numbered and once that number comes, I could be gone forever. I think about that daily and I'm proud I can do that, but I think it takes much more of a toll on me than I think it does.

I'm a major hypochondriac. Some nights all I can think about is the possibility that something is wrong with my body and that the next day I'll roll over dead or be diagnosed and have a short time remaining. This is my reasoning for why I don't think I'm as comfortable with death as I think I am. I've ruminated on why I have this anxiety for so long, and I think this is the reason. What do I do to be truly be comfortable with death? Do I try and focus my energy into other things? Do I meditate? Do I read?

My biggest goal for the last two years has been to make a name for myself in a niche programming community. I've written a few things here and there which gained some attention, and have grown a YouTube channel to a few thousand subscribers.

But then I see others in the same field as me, who are just constantly knocking it out of the park. Tons of blog articles, videos, projects they're creating and finishing, and recognition that comes with it. It's miles ahead of what I'm putting out, and I just feel like I'm stuck in the slow lane.

The worst part about it, is that *I have nothing intrinsically holding me back* from doing that, other than myself. I'm horrible at time management, procrastination, and distractions. If I could actually accomplish what I set out to do on my to-do list each day, this might not be that bad. But each day is a struggle to get started or see things through, and so another day ends with a half-finished list that gets pushed to tomorrow.

Reading about the principles of Stoicism in general, I feel like there's some way of thinking that I could attach to these issues that might help me out. Alternatively, something to point me in the right direction away from these feelings which compound on my already fragile motivation, and downright cripple my productivity."

1,"Commentary on Meditations 2.1 - ""When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself .."" Hi Everyone, 

I'll be doing daily commentaries on various different passages from different Stoics. This will serve as first and foremost a outlet for my own thoughts to become organized and coherent as I read the Stoics, and as a discussion point and clarification for anyone that reads it. 

*Let's get started with Meditations 2.1 -* 

 **""When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions.""**

**1)** People are going to be dicks. They're going to be jerks. They're going to judge you and treat you like shit. Make you mad. It's inevitable and part of human nature - humans, by our  nature, are social animals, and the social world is complex. Our ancestors used these as strategies in the past to survive the harsh conditions of pre-civilized society. It's part of our hardwiring. 

**2)** However, as Stoics, we have the beauty of seeing the ""good"" part of human nature - virtue, nobility, tranquility in the face of suffering. We know what the ugliness of these things leads to. We become lesser versions of ourselves. We should not drop to the level of people who exhibit these types of social strategies. 

**3)** We, are also human. The people that annoy you are human. YOU have the same capacity as them. This understanding should lead you to a sense of forgiveness and being unhurt. That's just how they'll act - as Marcus Aurelius says further down in the meditations - ""you might as well resent a fig tree for secreting juice"" 

**4)** As social creatures, we have a duty to our fellow humans (even if they are dicks) to act with virtue. It is part of our nature after all. Anger and resentment don't help society in the long term. Think about it - this was a KING of one of the greatest ancient empires. He could have executed anyone who pissed him off with ease, think about how much self-control Marcus must've had. 

**TLDR:** 

* People act with bad intentions, can't ignore it. 
* Don't feel harmed or hurt by people with bad intentions. 
* You are just like people who act with bad intentions, but you can make the choice to act with virtue."
1,"Everyone And Everything Dies Knowing that things are finite in this world is a wonderful motivator for all actions and behaviors. It gives us a perspective to love harder, live better, and be greater. You are finite. This is it. Every love you have will be in this world. Every accomplishment will be here in this world. Every person you meet and thing you do is anchored here and needs your attention and engagement. If you stop remembering that you stop living and start dying.

This is as much a statement of gratitude as it should be of relief. You should be grateful to have everything you have. To reflect on the loves you have or have had. The experiences. The chances and choices and the shattered glass resurrects of a heart that can still hold love. This is your chance. The only one you have. Be grateful you have even that shot.

And be relieved when your day comes. Relieved that you put everything out there into the world. Every drop of sweat and blood and tears and breath. You let the world have everything of you and you will be relieved to put down the weight of such a fulfilled life. You will have told your story and will be ready for the close. Those are the lessons of dying. It’s not a sadness, it is a possibility. "
1,"Get Over It And Keep Your Shit Together More often than not, we spend so much time whining and pining over situations that are out of our control that most of our life is consumed with lost possibilities behind us instead of the real possibilities ahead of us. I want you to start understanding the difference between what you can control and what you can’t control and focusing all your time on the former and letting the latter go as often as possible. 

This means not throwing a shit fit when you don’t get what you want or something doesn’t turn out how you planned. Life doesn’t care about your plans and more often than not you are not going to get what you want. So get over it and keep your shit together. No temper tantrums. No whining. No sulking.

But this piece of advice also means cultivating a sense of calm in difficult situations, because they will always come. From infancy to death you will be faced consistently with unbearable, heartbreaking moments that will be out of your control, and the value of them, the meaning and weight of them, will be had through how you react to them. What they teach you after the fact. And you can only be receptive to the lessons if you keep your shit together. "

I recently realized no matter what, I am alone. If I feel happy or depressed, I am the only person who can help me. And I do not know how to embrace these emotions because I was denying and rejecting any emotion I perceive to be negative. I opened up myself and learned to feel and accept these emotions just about 4-5 years ago. 

Thus, I am having difficulty dealing with stress. I want to at least try different ways of destressing and relaxing from people who also experiences this feeling of loneliness and being alone. 

If I feel anger I do not know how to vent or rant it in a healthy way. It is like I am eating it up and not releasing it. If I show or try to act upon it I always feel guilty and embarrassed which I realized should not be the case."

Despite my dislike of my dad (who prior to this I had cut out for years), I've felt that I've had to take control because I am the only person in this situation with some power. For example, they are going into debt due to no money, even though my dad has £100,000+ in savings. Why, you ask? The alcohol dementia has made him forget his email, bank accounts, old jobs, and most of the time, what he's had for breakfast that morning. Why doesn't his partner and carer sort it out? She's tried, her second language English and the administrative horror of doing things, combined with her working part-time and caring for my dad full-time (he doesn't pay her) have made that near impossible, and has been made all the worse by my father denying he has any health issues once she finally managed to get Social Services and benefits around.

It's an awful situation that on their end, sounds like a living hell, and has also made my life hellish. Since I started a few weeks back, I've organized the extermination of mice and a multitude of medical appointments, including chatting to his GP and telling her that anything he says about his drinking is a lie, which led to her actually having words to him about his drinking and prescribing numerous things to lessen the impact of the damage, got my dad new glasses, chased off and got a refund back from one of the companies that scammed him (a very ugly process that involved legal action and Trading Standards), and am organizing that he and his carer get monthly payments from his private pension, and will be taking control of his accounts and essentially, controlling all of his affairs. So, it's a lot. And I'm not getting paid for it. I'm self-employed so most weeks I've just been working until 2am to fit in my work around the phone calls, paperwork, time spent organizing etc. My partner and I have even sent them money from our precious savings until they are able to get acess to the private pension.

I am making a huge sacrifice here. My partner, who is supportive, is too. Our lives aren't wrecked, but it was a huge hit. For someone who does not appreciate it, at all. My dad barely notices what I'm doing. I noticed, as well, that he had offered to pay his other LPA people. I asked who they were and he doesn't remember. I know that when this is all done, it looks like any money he has is going on care, and of course, his £400+ a month alcohol habit. There's also the dark knowledge that he would not do the same for me. When I was 16 and homeless, he didn't care and didn't help. He was a terrible dad.

I also had to spend my adolescence caring for my alcoholic mother. I am struggling with feelings of resentment and bitterness, especially because a few weeks prior to the power of attorney I felt that our lives were coming into some sort of order. My C-PTSD (which my dad massively contributed to) was getting better, work was getting better, we had started some new healthy lifestyle habits etc. 

It feels like my parents just wreck my life, always. Well, they have done. And despite the efforts I've had with cutting them out, literally leaving the country where they live, and building my own life which I'm happy within the face of catastrophic C-PTSD, I am still just tied to these arseholes.

Most days, I'm alright, I'm functional. I'm so exhausted I just keep doing things, focus on the next task. 

How would a stoic handle this situation - in terms of coping with it?"

1,"Not Even Being Able to Escape I spent last night watching videos about people like Alex Lewis and yet I'm still annoyed at my own relatively trivial problems. Very unphilosophical. The issue is that they still affect me and I can't not think about them.

Firstly, I've had ear problems for a long time. I finally sorted most of them out after having a polypectomy and mastoidectomy. But the tinnitus I've had for as long as I can remember is still here and sometimes it's so bad I don't want to read. It's not one of those things one can just forget about if it's bad enough. Secondly, about a year ago I developed some kind of urinary infection out of nowhere and I've had all sorts of issues in that area every day since. I have to get up to go to the toilet constantly and I almost always feel like I need to go the toilet even when I don't. It's a terrible feeling. These two problems combined make reading a chore sometimes. The only way I don't succumb to a black depression--reading and writing are my main hobbies--is to go day by day. I could live with the tinnitus, but this urinary problem, whatever it is, won't go away despite multiple trips to GPs and hospital checks. Not sure how to deal with these problems.

I'm reading Meditations after having read Irvine's Guide to the Good Life and a collection of Cynic sayings. Problem is, not matter how much I try to take on the principles of Stoicism, I just can't blank out these problems. I would honestly rather have an excruciating pain whenever I moved my arm or leg than have these constant and more psychologically subtle problems which are hampering my creativity and not even allowing me to escape easily. I don't really know if I have a concrete question, but is there a specific Stoic saying about how to blank out--well, it's not quite pain. All the advice about disregarding everything that's in the mind is valuable, but the problem is it's the mind that causes these problems in the first place. Marcus probably considered the mind as a separate and spiritual element whereas today we know that everything is organic, chemical and caused by the brain."
1,"My recent life story Hello Guys, I wanted to share my story with you and ask for independent opinion.
I aM 27 male from small country in Europe , I work in accounting - audit company and i am at senior level first time in my life this year.
3 weeks ago I was coming home from work and received phone call from my friend (I have couple of good friends from elementary school times and we keep on together in some extent).
He was repairing my bike and he informed me that it is ready. I came to his garage, we had small chat , mood was good (Friday evening etc.) after some minutes there was moment where I mentioned something about “kevlar”, he suddenly told me that he ll show me something, in couple of seconds I had some shitty glove on my right hand and he run knife through my hand. Unfortunately glove did not make it and he cut my hand. He reacted quickly , gave me some bandage and took me to hospital . I could not move with my pinky finger . There was plastic surgery of my pinky finger tendon and after 3 weeks, yesterday they put the big bandage down. My hand looks terrible, I used to workout and bike and run for last couple of months in good tempo and these weeks were bad. I felt so much anger over my friend , he was sorry and felt terrible after all of that, but I somehow cannot get over it. Today I talked with him in person after 3 weeks, because I could not see him because of rage. I told him all my thoughts and feelings through little tears that came. And asked him for money. He gave them to me. (1 month salary). My rehabilitation starts from Monday and I want try to go back to work too . I feel like I had my life pretty set up (sports, family, girlfriend, good work ethic) and now this thing happened and I feel little broken by that thing. In work I did not tell truth still (I told them that I cut myself). I want to try moving forward but I cannot think clearly as there are many emotions that I try to go through. Could you guys tell me your opinion on this subject ? I would be very grateful. Thank you"
1,"Quality on this sub recently Hi, 
I do not know if it is just me, but I feel like this sub has lost some quality. When I read the FAQ this stoic community seems open, thought out, tolerant and self-critical. But most posts in the last weeks were either pretty uninspiring, self-validating without any new enriching ideas, or things like ""feelings don't matter"", which is very far from any good philosophy, at least in my opinion.

So I would like to hear your opinions on this, because this sub has brought me little good in the past two months, sometimes even harmful thoughts and concepts. 

Maybe this is just me and maybe stoicism just isn't my thing, but I remember feeling better after visiting this sub, so that's something."
1,"Confused about desires?  I feel so strange. I absolutely do not feel anything from being virtuous. I applied the indifference to anything external so that we should not have desires because they are out of your control. I do those things since it makes sense and I just focused on my virtues, but I do not feel anything. Am I doing something wrong? Am I suppose to feel this way when applying Stoicism? I feel quite empty and possibly bored. Maybe a hint of sadness, but am I suppose to feel this way? At the same time  I don't feel like doing anything. Everything just feels like it's out of my control."
1,"How do you deal with privilege guilt? I come from a privileged background. I was laid off like many other people, but have a great safety net thanks to hard working and supportive parents. That's not the case with some of the people I know who are really struggling, beyond depressed due to money troubles. You switch on the news and you see stories of people being evicted, others driven to the point of queuing in ""breadlines"". And I'm just sitting here, not being able to relate to any of that because of how lucky I am. How do you deal with the ""starving kids in Africa"" syndrome. When everything you see on social media and the news is a reminder of how much of a privileged c\*nt you are. I've been coping with these for a few months by reminding myself that no matter how well meaning you are you can't all the problems in the world. I empathize with the issues and the suffering but I can't do anything beyond the ""thoughts and prayers"" platitude that only serves to soothe your guilt, virtue signaling and all that. I was really depressed because of this for a while until I decided to stop doomscrolling, stop watching the news and avoid anything that is just too sad, bury my head in the sand. And it worked, I've been happier since but you can't completely do that. One day you'll go out to get something and by accident manage to hear on the radio or eavesdrop on someone mentioning some tragedy somewhere and you get that reminder of how powerless you are and how you'll probably go your whole life without something like that ever happening to you, and it just ruins your day. Pretending the world is sunshine and rainbows and remaining willfully ignorant is a coping strategy that works. People in the old days never had to deal with this much information. You'd spend your whole life in a small quiet town isolated from the news of war, suffering that went on in the other side of the world. Ignorance is bliss, it just sucks that this is the way it works. Try to empathize with all the suffering that's going on and you will find yourself going crazy soon.

1,"Can I be a stoic if I regularly indulge in unproductive things, such as videogames? The Stoic values and way of living speak to me, and I want to become a practicing Stoic. I want to improve my overall life by changing how I perceive feelings and events in my life. I firmly believe that ""the happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts"" - Marcus Aurelius.

However, I'm having trouble figuring out how I can be the best version of myself while being happy. I invest a decent amount of time reading books (3-4 books a month), being with family and friends, working, and exercising (just up to the point of a healthy body). Additionally, I feel like I have to prove myself and become ""the best version of myself"" in my career. To do that, I try to spend much time studying (e.g., for work-related certifications). In that sense, I feel like I'm failing Stoic values when I play videogames (with or without friends). 

For example, it's 5 P.M. (or 17:00) on a Sunday during COVID. I woke up at 8 A.M., spent time with my wife (e.g., Sunday dinner and going for a walk), read a book, and spent a few hours studying for work-related certifications. At that moment, I feel tired of studying and reading, and I long to play some videogames with my friends. Would that be considered acceptable in Stoicism? If I understand Stoicism correctly, playing videogames instead of studying would not be ""virtuous,"" adding value to your life or improving yourself. On the other hand, I love to play video games, and I believe it brings me joy and happiness. That said, it only provides instant gratification and no long-term fulfillment. 

I feel guilty whenever I play a videogame, because I could have spent time studying and improving my career. On the other hand, I feel less happy when I study and don't enjoy my life to the fullest. I think I'm not going to be as happy as I could be if I'm ""virtuous"" all the time. Likewise, I think I'm not going to be as satisfied as I could be if I don't have the best career I can. To me, these feel like Stoic values are clashing: (1) becoming the best version of yourself, virtuousness, and (2) enjoying the present moment."
1,Stop letting things push you around 
1,"Feelings don't matter. Story time - Today I was outdoor at a place with my new friends and I saw my ex there, first I was a little unsure coz of all the mask and outfit. I felt nothing, but as soon as we got near her, It got confirmed it was her only, and my vunreability struck me down like a bitch. 

Little back story - We had a ugly breakup, and we hurt each other's ego pretty bad which Ig atleast for me is the reason for feeling this way, even though talked later alright i.e recently - It still looks pretty ugly on my side but whatever.

Later in story -  I panicked, I felt a rush in body telling me to hide, my body couldn't resist to run on the back of some walls, where she wouln't be able to see me , my friends were looking at me and asked wassup? I told them I don't want her to see coz she ll annoy me and all. I felt embarrased but later, coz ""at that moment"" I was lil overwhelmed by shit itself, I aversed every peice of myself from her, after I confirmed she was gone we moved forward to sit, I started recollecting quotes, passages, my own past experience, I got a more aware of my self and all , but the feeling wasn't gone

I was pissed at myself for behaving like that,  started questioning my myself, what was the point of the spending all that time in learning , understanding and trying implement Stoicism when I'm just fall gonna break like this, I recollected all my knowledge again, and everything was telling me to just chill and say a Hi. But I could't so examined my feelings at that time -

My 'non stoic' old normal mentality is weak infront of her, I feel vunreable, inferior, intimidated (idk more term for ugly feeling in my gut) even though I didn't wanna admit this before, but fuck it - I have examined and I don't wanna lie anymore to myself. Then Stoicism comes in the play when I have accepted that how badly I feel so fucked

I understand she is external, so she can't harm me, untill I choose to be harmed. I should not desire or averse to her for the same reason, but the point - The feeling wasn't going away and I bet It ll come again at times like this BUT why should I care? - yes I still feel like shit (while writing this) and maybe am gonna later too (*premeditatio malorum*). But atleast now I am fully aware and ***in control of my truly own faculties.*** Cause I Don't Control My Feelings, They come they go. I can only Control what I Choose to do with the, Ignore them?, examine and addresss the reality? be scared and do as they say?   The thing is whenver we encounter with a bad feeling our brain sceams 'FuckOff from here, Fuck this'. The Scream is not audible or with a clear sign, so we normally are not aware of this but we can atleast examine it later and be aware of it for the future

Accept however fucked, ugly and bad you feel. Don't be mad at yourself cause you feel that way and think 'I Still feel bad and troubled, so maybe stoicism isn't working shit for me, thats not how stoicism works, It litreally gives all the wisdom in the world to tell you, you can and are above your feeling and emotions. So say fuck feelings, just because I feel like shit (honesty,acceptance), Doesn't mean I am bound by it. ""Emotions and Feeling are there to serve you Not the other way around - can't remember who said it"". They naturally influence your mind (cause they too want the better of you but are not very smart as Stoics) but you can still be neutral by being aware of it and by all the other wisdom that is provided. ""In the moment they may get the better of you, but as soon as you get aware of it, start examining it and seprate down the facts, accept them, think whats next? or what a Stoic would do next. The feeling obviously will take a little time to fade away, thats how this chemical works. With time you ll get the grip by taking things one by one.  

lol I still feel the rush,and embarrasment of running, I know she saw me avoiding her, wondering how low she would be thinking of me, anyways

It's from [Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance). This part is about hiking in the nature, but as a lot of thoughts in this book, it can be extended into more general, 'life as a whole' situations. 

&gt; 
&gt; To the untrained eye ego-climbing and selfless climbing may appear identical. Both kinds of climbers place one foot in front of the other. Both breathe in and out at the same rate. Both stop when tired. Both go forward when rested. But what a difference! The ego-climber is like an instrument that's out of adjustment. He puts his foot down an instant too soon or too late. He's likely to miss a beautiful passage of sunlight through the trees. He goes on when the sloppiness of his step shows he's tired. He rests at odd times. He looks up the trail trying to see what's ahead even when he knows what's ahead because he just looked a second before. He goes too fast or too slow for the conditions and when he talks his talk is forever about somewhere else, something else. He's here but he's not here. He rejects the here, is unhappy with it, wants to be farther up the trail but when he gets there will be just as unhappy because then it will be ""here.'' What he's looking for, what he wants, is all around him, but he doesn't want that because it is all around him. Every step's an effort, both physically and spiritually, because he imagines his goal to be external and distant."

1,"Memento Mori - Contemplation of death  Remember you will die. The stoics have this wonderful practice of reminding themselves of death constantly. The Buddhists also has a similar meditation called contemplation of death.

As they say, the greatest teachers in life are old age, sickness, and death. I will keep it joyful and only talk about death. I will never forget the first time I learned about death. I can’t remember how old I was but I was super young.

My mother was telling me and my brother a story and the word “death” came along. My brother and I were unfamiliar with that term. My mother had to explain it and I started crying. I was not crying because I would die. I was crying because I was scared of losing her.

When you realize that you will die and everybody you love will die, it’s not a fun day. It is what it is though. It is liberating to know that it will happen to all of us. Death is not something to be feared or to decide for oneself (i.e suicide)

Death is to be embraced as a natural part of the process of life. Pondering upon death brings about a sense of urgency for our time is limited. Whether you believe in reincarnation, eternal hell, or heaven or nothing (nihilism) we all know and believe in death.

Realizing that death comes to us all and unexpectedly should make us humble and yes also powerless because we no power over it. Death will surely come and it will come on its own accord and without any heads up.

When you really think about it, it can be infuriating. We will die and we can die at anytime and we don’t even how we will pass. How is it not maddening to have so little control over such a big event?

Once we pass that stage of anger and frustration, what we have to humbly admit is that we do not have a choice in the matter. Death is inevitable, therefore we should embrace and contemplate it. Not because it is fun but because that’s the only way we can make sense of life and gain wisdom.

How else will we know what to prioritize and what matters if we do not understand that we will die ? How can we start detaching and be equanimous if we don’t start to fathom what is death?

No matter what happens to us in life we should always have memento Mori in mind. When something great happens, good memento Mori. I will die. When something bad happens, it’s OK, this too will pass. Memento Mori.

Do you see what I mean? In the grand scheme of things, all the seemingly good and bad things don’t matter much. What truly matters most is the smaller things. The people we love. The people that love us back. The kindness, the love, the warmth, the care, the generosity, the peace, and all that good stuff.

All the struggles, failures, successes, material gains will not matter. You might have some status, fame even posterity but it does not matter much you will be dead.

Yes, it’s important to leave a legacy where others will remember you as someone who did well because truly that’s the only thing you get to bring with you when you die. Your karma.

That’s very important. Life is transient and death comes unexpectedly so make good with it and do good. Now is the time to live a wholesome life.

Don’t deluded yourself into thinking that next week, next month, next year you will change. Start now. Tomorrow is not guaranteed. Whatever happens to you now, always remind yourself memento Mori. I will die. I will die.

Why should you do that? One word: Perspective

Once you understand death you won’t take anything and anybody for granted. Last, but not least you won’t take life for granted because to truly understand death is to truly appreciate life. [https://youtu.be/5rpYPt4H8po](https://youtu.be/5rpYPt4H8po)"

1,"Genghis Khan, one of the most ruthless conquerers this world has ever seen, on anger ( quote and mythical story) "" An action performed in anger is an action doomed to failure""

I also have a myth, probably not very accurate, about him, but still a good lesson I suppose. 

One hot summer day, Genghis Khan and his tribe, moving west, were passing through southern Asia, and found themselves in extremely unfamiliar territory, between high and dry mountains. They were dying of thirst. Literally. Would this be the end of the great conquerer and his tribe? He sent his trusted eagle to the sky, told him to get a good view of the area, and lead them to the next lake. The eagle came back, but no lake was to be found. No source of water. The situation became desperate, but, Genghis Khan kept on moving. A few hours later, they came across a beautiful big lake, and jumped up and down with excitement. Genghis roared at his eagle, perched on his shoulder, with glee, calling it very stupid. He bent down, filled his flask, and right before he brought it to his parched lips, the eagle struck the flask out of his hands. Genghis was angry, but, nonetheless, he tried again. Again the eagle struck the flask. Genghis was furious, and told the eagle he'd kill it, if that happened again. The eagle looked at him blankly. Once again, genghis filled his flask, looked at the eagle, and brought it to his lips. The eagle struck the flask once more. Genghis was livid, grabbed the eagle, his most trusted helper, one who had brought him so much success, and broke its neck. Everyone was extremely frightened of the scene. But then, genghis came back to his senses. The eagle was never wrong. Why was it acting as so. He looked closer at the water. At the origin of the river. It was very high up the mountain. Then an idea came to his head. He filled his flask, and gave it to one of the carry animals. He poured the water down the animals throat. One minute passed, two, then three. Genghis was getting impatient, was about to take a good drink himself, when, the animal fell, and never rose again. The water was poisonous. The eagle knew it all along, seeing the origin of the water from high up, but did not mention it to Genghis."

Yet, isn’t there time where people do will wrong? Those who actually can distinguish good and evil, yet choose evil? 

How could you tell whether one is just ignorant or actually desires to perform wrongly?"
1,Loneliness What would a stoic say to someone struggling with debilitating loneliness? Asking for a friend
1,"Stoicism has simultaneously made me content in life but also killed my competitiveness and drive I've accomplished things I think are very impressive due to a drive to prove people wrong, anger, hatred, etc. I was able to work 16 hour days, 7 days a week. I was also, unsurprisingly in retrospective, a negative and unhappy person. Even despite the things I accomplished, I was just unhappy with everything. Since discovering and taking stoicism very seriously for the last year or two, I've become a very content person. I am much more upbeat and positive according to my friends. I don't take moments with loved ones for granted anymore, and am able to sit still and just appreciate looking out a window. My quality of life has drastically improved and I'm a completely different person. The only issue is that I don't have drive and motivation anymore. I still want to do the same creative work I was doing before, and would still like to work 16 hour days, to still have a kind of fire inside of me to create and do things, but I just don't. There's just nothing there. It has left me feeling lost, despite my overall contentment. I know now how pathetic it is to dedicate my time and energy to proving people wrong, to winning the praise of others, chasing these kinds of superficial and stupid things. But it did give me an insane drive to accomplish. Is it possible to get that back without conflicting with stoic ideas? How was Marcus Aurelius motivated to do the greatest he could as an Emperor instead of just being apathetic and complacent, throwing up his hands and saying ""eh, whatever""? What motivated Epictetus and Seneca and all the greats to teach, to write, to strive? Thanks for reading and for your time."

1,"Reaching out for some help I don't know where to start. I got heavy into stoicism 2 years ago. Was on top of the world in a way, I was working a difficult and labor intensive yet rewarding job. I worked with people I genuinely enjoyed being around and going to work truly was kind of fun. I got married and had an awesome vacation to greece shortly before I let myself spiral out of control.

My company had a change of ownership and people started dropping off and I moved from assembly to help desk. This was about a year ago.

At first it wasn't so bad but the never ending calls coming in combined with the ""you're the only one who knows how to do this can you help"" perpetual on-call slowly took their toll on me. And when I needed to be strong and not be a POS I did just the opposite. Over the last year I started vaping again. I stopped working out. Stopped listening to tao of seneca on my drive to work. I started overeating, stopped my side projects of learning programming and increasing my typing speed. I started drinking most nights and in a pathetic (rather american) attempt to get back to fixing myself I started taking tianeptine (a legal in US opiate like anti depressant developed I believe in Russia and taken by only fools) daily. 

I'm miserable friends.

While I tried to stay true to stoicism and myself I've hit a rock bottom I wasn't expecting. 

I feel like every time I try to get back on my feet I faulted. I fucked up so many habits I don't even know where to start. Part of me thinks I should try to be the person I was all at the same time. Another part thinks I should just start with one change but at this point I don't know what that one change should be.

Just feeling a bit lost and adrift, any advice would help."
1,"How many of you live somewhat ascetically? I know most stoics don't think that having material possessions is inherently bad but complete materialism is.

I've decided to break it down by the four stoic virtues, though, with 4 subcategories for Wisdom and 3 subcategories for the virtues. I've have a fairly easy time thinking of types of Wisdom, Justice, and Temperance, even being able to cherry pick for the areas that I think are lacking in my life and that I'd like to cultivate. I'm having more difficulty doing this with Courage, though. So, what does courage mean to you? What different kinds of courage do you seek to strengthen? How do you practice them in daily life?"
1,"does being a stoic mean you can't love material things? Hello. My question is simple.

I am a piano player for a hobby. I love the instrument and the number of things I can play and I dream and aspire to play more in the future. You see, I'm not intending on leaving piano behind.

So... I heard stoicism tells not to be attached to anything. I'm not sure I 'can' be attached to music.

I mean, in death, I know it will stop but it is a fun way to live until that point. Any thoughts?

1,"Losing my love for people, the opposite of what I want to happen. I've made great progress since I've begun my journey, however I feel like I've lost my love for others. I believe I appreciate what I have and what's been given, but the love is no longer there. Whether it's for family or friends. I hate no one, but I do not love either. 

The dearest person in my life is my mother, and when I was younger it was very adamant I loved her. It's like I understand peoples emotions and where they come from more than ever, but no longer can connect. Whereas when I was younger I connected way more, but hardly could understand. I remember seeing a homeless man with a defeated look on his face, and I instantly started crying.

One of my biggest goals is to be able to love everyone indiscriminately, because I do want to, I just don't know how? I do realize that others are externals, therefore I shouldn't wish for them to be this way or that, but it would indeed be natural to have love for them.

The same applies for sadness. Now, I'm a very happy guy, but sometimes I just want to let out a good cry. The most I can get is a single tear, or my eyes slightly watering. Once that happens I just accept I won't be able to cry, take a deep breath, and try to recognize where this feeling is coming from.

My mother recently had to get an ambulance to the hospital in the middle of the night. Before they showed up, she was facedown on the ground. Still conscious, and was able to slightly talk to me. I didn't know if she was going to die, so I said I appreciated her and what she has done for us. Though this was mostly out of the fact that a good man would say that, not because I thought I should. It makes me feel like a scumbag thinking back on it. I was a little worried during the ideal, but that's all... Really makes me question my genuinity.

Does anybody have a clue as to why this is, and how I could love? Maybe I do, but maybe it won't show until I lose someone close. I know this isn't something that some words will be able to fix, but any pointers to where I can start, what I can contemplate on? Thank you."
1,"Thoughts on calls to authority and/or history as a shorthand towards efficacy? TL;DR: Stoic ideals and reasoning don't depend on the historical or cultural importance of the writer. 

I was reading the Daily Stoic newsletter today, and it's talking about the Gettysburg address. It attempts to make some vaguely stoic connections to that speech and it's impact and intent.

It got me thinking about how much Stoic content is specifically written about or advocates it's usage by prominent figures in history.

Also, mostly male figures, but that's a whole other discussion!

I know that it's valuable to see Marcus Aurelius as an important stoic; for many, he's the way in, the first reference or at least one of the most notable. Having a Roman Emperor 'in the ranks' of stoics is definitely exciting and compelling. Seneca was a statesman.

Epictetus was a slave for some time, and many of the other historical (OG) stoics definitely had more humble beginnings, but Marcus is probably the most referenced and highlighted.

Modern thinkers (particularly the Daily Stoic) keep referring to other prominent leaders and thinkers, either claiming them as stoic or at least attributing stoic virtues to anecdotes about them.

Again, I understand the appeal, but it also seems like a possible trap or issue: shouldn't the virtue of the idea be enough without needing to attach it to prominence?

Heck, the writing in Meditations often seems to be explicitly saying that those trappings don't matter.

What if we'd found Meditations in a Roman soldier's pack as their own writing? Or heck, removing soldiering from it entirely, what if it was in a Roman cobbler's uncovered home? Would the writings still have the same impact on us? I think they *should.*

A reasonable point, well said, should be enough on it's own.

If you've seen notable content that engages with thinkers or examples that don't draw on prominence to lend weight, I'd love to see them!

(P.S. The Daily Stoic often bugs me, causing me to react and say 'That's not Stoic!' And then wanting to come here and complain about it. That's what inspired this post, but I hope that I've transformed that impulse into a constructive question.

Because just complaining about someone else's content not being properly stoic doesn't feel virtuous!)"
1,"Doubt on Stoicism regarding future Hello. I am an intermediate Stoic if you will. I know the basic principles and have read meditations. I'm now reading the daily stoic.

I have, however, a doubt regarding Stoicism. You see, Stoicism tells me: one is not to wonder about the future. Yet, Stoicism also tells: prepare in advent. Better said, ""devastation is a factor of out and likely we can see that that event in the first place - The Daily Stoic, 24-11"".

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: how can one not think about the future and yet prepare in advance for its possible difficulties?"
1,"How to receive pleasure from pursuing the highest goals (on bad days)? Greetings,

&amp;#x200B;

I've found that while I can stay abstinent from lowly pleasures and continue on the path of self improvement it's difficult maintain a ""mind equillibrium"" .  


On good days I am fulfilled and happy with the thought of pursuing higher goals, on bad days however there is a certain lack of pleasure which the mind seems to need to function well. These are days on which I do the things which have to be done, while abstaining from brainless activities, but I'm not able to gain pleasure from my virtue. My brain wants simple dopamine and will produce a rather deppresive state of mind when it doesn't get it.   


But maybe I should just accept that these days happen on continue on the path since one shouldn't give in to (disguised) pain.   


Or with the words of the emperor:

1,"The dangers of repressing emotions and how to tell when it’s happening My biggest desire is to cultivate patience and temperance within myself and in my life with my partner.

I don’t, however, want to repress anger because I believe that can be problematic. I’d like to be able to make sure that I am not repressing resentment or anger when I decide to talk it through in my mind with the principles of stoicism (and CBT).

It’s hard to tell, because I can talk myself down and work through something and then the next time there is an argument I’m really upset at something that I had previously worked through. It’s like I’m still upset, even though I am dealing with things calmly.

Basically I am in a relationship with someone who is very very difficult to communicate with. I’m at my wit’s end."
1,"How would a stoic deal with past mistakes that he/she currently and continuously has to financially, physically and emotionally pay For, Without losing her virtues?

I am new to Stoicism, still trying to understand the stoic way to look at things.

I personally am full of regrets, shame and guilt that i no longer wish to be crippled by but they have also put me in a situation where i am stuck with the obligation to solve them. And they happen to be in many aspects of my life. The worry and panic that comes with it, makes it hard to create and maintain the cool head to find stability within.
When you are in this situation , what is a healthy way to approach it? How do you start solving it ? 

I feel like if i try to be present and take things step by step, the present moment is too painful and heavy to deal with, without distractions.

I suppose this sounds like any sort of random life complaint but I really want to change it. 
And I have been fascinated by stoicism as a life philosophy because it seems to be the most grounded reality. I never bought the positive thinking self improvement thing."

1,I don’t respond to yelling This is what I almost said to my toddler daughter  who stood yelling at me for a bottle while I was loading the dishes. Almost. But I caught myself. I’ve been pretty much yelling at her all morning as she was getting into things and doing general toddler things. We were all up all night and are tired and on the grumpy side. But I can’t yell at her and expect her to respond if I’m trying to teach her not to yell at me to get what she wants. Felt like a good reminder for me to stay in control of my emotions. Parenting is hard. Stay strong moms and dads!
1,"Stoicism: A detailed critique Stoicism is the dominant ideology of the modern world. Everyone is stoic as emotions are taught to every child that they are harmful and must be destroyed by logic. This is the reason why so many people are suicidal due to Stoicism people bottle up their emotions thinking that if they pretend they aren't sad then they will be happy. Unfortunately, reality doesn't work like that and they gain depression through this. Stoicism's role in the world is one that is nonbeneficial to most people. So it's just Stoicism's role that is bad, the ideology itself surely could not be bad, right?

Wrong, Stoicism is quite the bad ideology itself as well. Stoicism is based on the foundations of suppressing emotions for the sake of society. Almost every Stoic is one because they want to have social credit and to prove themselves as men or if they are a woman, to prove themselves as masculine. Stoicism even if harmful to that individual will still partake in it to prove themselves. Unfortunately not only did this hurt the individual since society is made up of individuals it hurts society as well. The biggest blow to Stoicism would be that not everyone can be a Stoic to the horror of all Stoics. If a person is biologically incapable of suppressing their emotions then a Stoic goes insane, they can't think this is possible because it destroys their world view. ""No! No! No! there must be something wrong, biology can't shape a person's mind that is impossible!"" Even when they are given the reasons why they can't accept it.

Why is this? Because Stoicism is their cope. They use it prematurely as a form of coping with the problems of life. Even if Stoicism is proven to not even be able to be done by everyone, proven not to work, and proven to be harmful to both the individual and society. The Stoic still holds on as to let go would be to let go of their cope and ultimately their identity."
1,"Responsible for gods emotions? As a Stoic, we shouldn’t let our emotional state be dependent on external events but my Christian indoctrination (Southern Baptist) was full of emotional blame so I’m curious how Stpic Christians navigate this part of indoctrination. If my bad behavior makes Yahweh angry, why doesn’t he just apply some Stoic insight and get over it? I’m guessing that a Christian that practices Stoicism might not use this tactic to make kids behave?"

1,"We all have wants, the stoic only conquers the emotions that arise from their lack by good reason. &gt;""You must root out of men these two things-  arrogance and distrust. Arrogance, then, is  the opinion that you want nothing, but  distrust is the opinion that you cannot be 
happy when so many circumstances  surround you."" -Epictetus Discourses III:XIV

I used to struggle with understanding this saying by Epictetus until quite recently. As stoicism teaches that a man, in order to be happy must be self sufficient, Most people often tend to begin convincing themselves that they want nothing. But It is simply impossible not to want anything and it mostly proves futile trying to convince yourself otherwise.

We want good health, we want money for certain things and a host of others. It is in fact 'arrogant' to claim that we don't want these things.

What I have come to understand from Epictetus' saying is that, although we want these things and probably even need them, it is possible for us to remain comfortable and happy with not having them with good reason.

The more I study, the more I realize that the ancient stoics were just men like you and me who constantly put in efforts to become what they became.. they were simply human.

1,"How do Stoics rest as they practice Stoicism? I am not sure if they have mentioned this but Stoicism requires practice, i.e. mental practice. And practice exhausts energy, i.e. mental energy. If you consistently practice Stoicism, you will find yourself mentally exhausted since you keep on averting your impulses, previous mindsets, behaviours, etc.

So what is their take here? Do Stoics (at least modern) have ""cheat"" day (similar to food diet) where they just let their animal selves be?"

As the title says, I've just finished Year 12 and leading up to the end I've been keeping track of things that I need to do in the holidays (from today, the 19th of Nov till around mid March 2021). I'm struggling with a few points so below they're numbered if you wish to address only one or two :)

I'd say I'm fairly contentious and my biggest fear is not having a solid plan and completely wasting 4 valuable months of my life. So far what I've done to mitigate this preemptively is:

\- I've gone from 3 days to 5 days of work starting next week

\- I rock climb so I can do more of that in the holidays

\- like I said earlier, I've built up a small list of things such as cleaning my car (hasn't been cleaned for ages so this will take a solid day)

\- got plenty of plans to visit places in nature that I've been wanting to. Just day-trips here and there.

I JUST finished this morning with my last exam, and although there are still a few things to do (e.g. graduation ceremony, some final formalities to do in the coming weeks which require my presence at school) I already feel guilty for the break that's ahead, even though I've had a good year of hard work at school.

&amp;#x200B;

**2)**

Regarding the graduation as mentioned above, there is also going to be a school event (albeit smaller because of COVID) called a 'formal'. Not sure if it's the same in other countries but it's basically the Prom of Australia. Anyhow, I have no desire to attend either. My family is giving me a really hard time about this and pretty much anyone that I talk to is wondering why I don't want to dress up and party with the co-hort. This isn't a social issue with me, I just couldn't be fucked to spent one night like that. I'm not into drugs, alcohol, or in general being a dickhead for any longer than a few minutes. One theory I have is that I might be not wanting to go because of my friends situation. Basically the last time I've gone to school with my good group of friends was two years ago and since then I haven't formed any close relationships. It's hurt me a lot. It started as, ""Ok, I want to be a lone wolf for a while"", then it became necessary because school got busy, but now two years have flown by and I haven't kept good contact with my old mates either. Maybe this is why I don't want to go, but I doubt it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Do not waste what remains of your life in speculating about neighbours, unless with a view to some mutual benefit. To wonder what so-and-so is doing and why, or what he saying, or thinking, or scheming - in a word, anything that distracts you - means a loss of opportunity for some other task. See that the flow of your thoughts is kept free from idle or random fancies. 'What is in your mind at this minute?' habituate yourself so that you could respond frankly and without hesitation; thus proving that all his thoughts were simply and kindly, as becomes a social being with **no tasteful pleasures of sexual imaginings, jealousies, envies, suspicions, or any other sentiment that he would blush to acknowledge in himself.** \- Meditations 3.4

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts:

So much time is wasted on a daily basis; simply because we lose track of what matters and what doesn't. I'll give you examples of what does not matter: to wonder about his new car, his new house, his job, his wearing, watches, new phone, and so on. That just wastes your limited time. Don't allow your time to be wasted in that way.

Tell yourself, when you find that you are thinking of what doesn't matter, ""Why? Is this important? Will it make me closer to my objective? Why am I allowing my time to be wasted? No more.""

Don't blame yourself for having lost so much time in the past; it does not matter anymore and never will. Live right now, with yourself. It is not if one has more material things that he is better. If you think that way, you should rethink your principles because they don't match up. The mind is the only thing. We don't fully 'own' anything else. Change your thought if they are scaring you upsetting you; you have that power.

ALOT has happened in my family through my teen years at home. Death. Addiction. Fighting. Really horrible stuff.

I left my family home a few years ago and was driven to make something better of myself. I have truly changed my life around. Healthy habits like clean diet, excercise, meditation/mindfulness, stoicism, travelled lots, had relationships, journal, therapy just to name a few.

My whole mentality has changed and I can tell with new people that I meet they enjoy my company as I try to have a outlook on life like ""we're all going to die one day, lets enjoy this moment"" and I try be postive in all situations, lighthearted etc.

I haven't really had any issues/conflict since feeling like I grown into someone better than before.

Now my family are pretty much the same as before, overall negative mindset, they are looking for arguements, they will shift blame, super hostile, walking on eggshells around them to not cause a conflict, they all argue with each other and it just seems so toxic. I am always going in there with the person I am today and I try to help. Everyone mentions that I'm so healthy and always happy. I truly see the huge difference between us.

Now I've tried to help them in many ways, both subtle and more upfront.. they just can't stand the fact that something might be wrong with them.

I am going on a trip with them this christmas and they are already creating problems that are so minor, I even said a solution on how to solve them and they just reply stuff like ""it's so easy for you to say"" and shift blame towards me. I kind of give up trying to help them. There so stuck.

1,"Five remembrances / Stoicism *The Five Remembrances* of Buddhism seem in line with stoic philosophy, specifically *Memento Mori* (Remember you Must Die) . 

The Five Remembrances are to be meditated on with compassion.

This version is written by Thich Nhat Hanh:

1.) I am of the nature to grow old. There is no way to escape growing old. 

2.) I am of the nature to have ill health. There is no way to escape ill health.

3.) I am of the nature to die. There is no way to escape death.

4.) All that is dear to me and everyone I love are of the nature to change. There is no way to escape being separated from them.

5.) My actions are my only true belongings. I cannot escape the consequences of my actions. My actions are the ground upon which I stand.

For the Stoics, to be aware of death is to be aware of the preciousness of life. From contemplating death daily, you will begin to realize that you will not live forever. You will grow old and sick and weak and eventually die. Everyone you know will die as well. Do not waste any moments for the time of yesterday is already of the dead. And the future is uncertain. Act now."
1,Can someone give me a beginner's summary of Stoicism? 
1,"Stoicism for a Better Life - Weekly exercise (November 18, 2020) Hello there, 

For this week’s exercise, I will look for inspiration from Epictetus' Discourses. This is II 1.21:

&gt;""It will even do to socialize with men of good character, in order to model your life on theirs, whether you choose someone living or someone from the past.""  

We are all human beings; fatally flawed...full of emotions...primitive more often than we would like to admit. Let's never forget this. You are not a sage. You are not perfect. You were not born with all the virtue and knowledge in the world. You are, however, on this journey of self-improvement...and by choice no less. You are actively choosing to improve yourself. I mean, that is why you're currently reading this article right? So why not fully accept that we need externals to help guide us?

Yes, we want to be indifferent to externals but this does not mean we cannot learn from externals. Whether good or bad, externals can teach us what to do and what not to do; what to avoid and what to pursue. What Epictetus is reminding us here is that we can make the effort to actively surround ourselves with role models that demonstrate and exemplify the traits we want to cultivate to help guide us towards our end goal.

**So, as a practical exercise this week, take inventory of the people around you.** This includes your real-life (physical) interactions and relationships as well as your virtual interactions and relationships. **See if there are any bad apples that are worth removing and other good models to try and include in your entourage.** This selective grooming of the people you are exposed to and hang-out with is, of course, with the ultimate goal of maximizing your efforts and chances of being the best version of you that you can be.

As always I wish you a peaceful and wise week.

1,"My Favorite Stoicism Book - Epictetus' The Manual - A Summary Hey all,

It's my first post here. Over the past few years, I have been curating the highlights of my books into digestible summaries with relevant quotes.

This is undoubtedly my favorite book on stoicism. Short and dense of practical insights.

Would love to hear your thoughts. For some reason, I resonated much more with this than with Marcus Aurelius' Meditations (but I know that most people won't agree).

\-------------------

## Things Within Vs Outside Of Our Power

There are things that are within our power, and things that fall outside our power. **Within our power are our own opinions, aims, desires, dislikes—in sum, our own thoughts and actions.** Outside our power are our physical characteristics, the class into which we were born, our reputation in the eyes of others, and honors and offices that may be bestowed on us. 

## Let Go Of Things Beyond Your Power

Whenever distress or displeasure arises in your mind, **remind yourself, “This is only my interpretation, not reality itself.”** Then ask whether it falls within or outside your sphere of power. And, if it is beyond your power to control, let it go. 

## Try To Control Things Out Of Your Power And You’ll Suffer

If you avoid only those undesirable things which are within your control, you will never suffer by attaining something you detest. But if you try to avoid what you cannot control—sickness, poverty, death—you will inflict useless mental suffering upon yourself. 

End the habit of despising things that are not within your power, and apply your aversion to things that are within your power.

**When you desire something outside your sphere of power, you set yourself up for disappointment. But it is within your power to avoid disappointment, by directing your desires to things that are rightfully yours to obtain and control.** 

## The Future Is Beyond Your Control

When you hear predictions of the future, do not become fearful or excited—remember that future events are beyond your control. Keep the same serene mindset you had before hearing the prediction. **When you understand that outside events do not touch your deepest self—what matters is your interpretation and reaction—you can use any circumstance to your benefit.**

## Accepting Death

When you embrace your wife or child, remember that they are mortal beings. By accepting their nature rather than denying it, if either should die you will find the strength to bear it.

## You Are In Control

When you are feeling upset, angry, or sad, don’t blame another for your state of mind. Your condition is the result of your own opinions and interpretations. 

Do not wish that all things will go well with you, but that you will go well with all things.

## Dealing With Provocateurs Or Annoying People

When anyone provokes you, remember that it is actually your own opinion provoking you. It is not the person who insults or attacks you who torments your mind, but the view you take of these things. Do not be fooled by how things first appear. With time and greater perspective, you can regain inner peace

**If someone tried to take control of your body and make you a slave, you would fight for freedom. Yet how easily you hand over your mind to anyone who insults you. When you dwell on their words and let them dominate your thoughts, you make them your master.** 

## Dealing With Challenges

Whenever a challenge arises, turn inward and ask what power you can exercise in the situation. If you meet temptation, use self-control; if you meet pain, use fortitude; if you meet revulsion, use patience. 

## Ignore Others (Respect Yourself)

If you find yourself acting to impress others, or avoiding action out of fear of what they might think, you have left the path. Find satisfaction in following your philosophy. If you want to be respected, start by respecting yourself. 

Do not fret about your own significance, worrying, “I’ll never become admired or renowned—I’m just a nobody from nowhere.” Is it your business to chase after political power or fame? No. Find your significance within yourself. 

## The Philosopher

**A philosopher is one whose thoughts and emotions are internally anchored. She criticizes no one, praises no one, blames no one. She considers herself a student, not an expert. When she fails, she takes responsibility. When she succeeds, she smiles to herself. She controls her desires.** She hates only those things which hinder the free use of her will. She acts with calm deliberation. If she comes across as knowing nothing in eyes of others, she does not care"

1,"Does anybody know which passage from Meditations this quote is from? If all emotions are common coin, then what is unique to the good man?

To welcome with affection what is sent by fate. Not to stain or disturb the spirit within him with a mess of false beliefs. Instead, to preserve it faithfully, by calmly obeying God – saying nothing untrue, doing nothing unjust. And if the others don’t acknowledge it – this life lived in simplicity, humility, cheerfulness – he doesn’t resent them for it, and isn’t deterred from following the road where it leads: to the end of life. An end to be approached in purity, in serenity, in acceptance, in peaceful unity with what must be.

1,"Are we really living according to nature? I'm fairly new to Stoicism, having discovered it through reading about CBT. I'm very much drawn to the practical benefits I see from adopting a Stoic approach to emotional regulation and focusing only on the things I can actually control.

One of the central ideas that I have a hard time squaring is that by living according to Stoic ideas we can live according to nature. The stoics didn't have the benefits of science - either in Evolutionary biology when it came to their ethics or modern physics when it came to their cosmology. For the ancient Stoics the universe was an orderly place, and the defining trait of humanity was Reason. 

While I see that humans are uniquely capable of certain kinds of reason, there are few things that come as naturally to our species as base, thoughtless tribalism, selfishness , and emotional reasoning.  All things our evolutionary past prepared us for. It just intuitively feels more like the central claim to stoicism should be to live in a way that transcends our nature.

Is this something you have squared in your interpretation of Stoicism, or is it something that many modern stoics just don't care that much about?"
1,"My thoughts on credit cards after reading stoic commentaries. We have usually heard the debate on whether or not to use credit cards and often times there are lot of folks (mostly from the previous generation) that strongly oppose to the idea of credit cards. One of the first advise for the people who are suffering from miserable money management is clear out their credit card bill or moreover avoid it completely.

While there is reason behind this advice, I feel the advise fails to convey the greater purpose that it should. The reason credit cards are perceived bad is because it's easy to fall into the trap of misusing credit. Same is the case for alcohol, drugs, guns, etc. An immature soul experiencing these objects often fall prey to its own carnal instincts. Current society makes it very easy for an immature soul to get access to these objects without proper mental training on how to use them diligently.

But is gun a vice ? No, the wielder decides to bring the virtue or vice out of it. Is credit card then a vice ? No, the wielder's maturity level brings the virtue or vice out of it.

If our ultimate goal is to embrace virtue in any situation, we should focus on strengthening our soul to a point where we do not fall prey to the pitfalls that an immature soul would fail to detect. And that strengthening can be brought by : 
A. Knowledge of the object.
B. Understanding of your faults and put rectification as a prerequisite for consumption.

I will conclude my rambling by stating the obvious:
Should you use credit card ?
Yes you definitely should if the situation makes sense. But the prerequisite is to understand the credit system, how the companies try to trap you into over-spending, and finally analysing whether your soul is ready for it? Are you mature enough ? Do you have a habit of overspending? Do you normally maintain expense logs? ,Etc. If these things are missing , consider these as part of the application form for credit card.

Such advice is more constructive because it tells the seeker that the problem is within him and that there is a tangible path to correct it.
Peace :)"
1,"Happiness come from within because the same exact person who is bringing you happiness could be the reason of someone else’s sadness/suffering. What you see as a reason of happiness could be seen as a reason of bad luck, tiring, horrible thing. 

I am looking at it from a wider perspective. The person that means the world to me, could be mean nothing to someone else. In fact, he or she could be hated for that. I would be waiting patiently for, others would leave as soon as he or she enters. I am reflecting now, as I have seen people in my life where I never liked their existance. But for others, someone would come to visit regularly or they would have partners and I wonder how. 

Now with that perspective, I wish I could change my feelings and my beliefs with my ex. My ex had haters. People never liked her and even family members rejecting her. Yet, I was passionate wanted to be close to her. She brought me happiness. I saw her as scarce and wanted to become even closer. 

Now, how do I reach the level of neutrality with her. How did others not see her as I did or how can i see her as they did? 

Dont get me wrong, I am not judging. I am just trying to understand my emotions and feelings and beliefs. 

Thank you,"
1,"Does Stoicism lead to polyamory? So I had this idea a couple weeks ago, that because what our partner thinks or wants is never under our power, and feeling bad because you have been cheated on is just an impression, it looks like we shouldn’t feel either bad nor betrayed because of it.

is there a solid argument that tells me that my partner should only be with me?

there are people that don’t care if their couple haves sex with another person, so feeling bad because of it is definitely a matter of perception. a situation where our couple haves sex with another person is only damaging to people that see it as a bad thing, it is not the act that hurts us, but our impression.

I don’t say that people should have sex with a lot of people, I just say that if it happened, it shouldn’t be a problem.

I have had this dilemma for some time now, I want to say that I’m not a poly person, but it looks like this is the path that Stoicism would naturally lead to.

I try not to distract myself with other thoughts or ""binge"" the pain. or try to numb it or talk myself into to it because clearly that doesn't work for me. Sometimes, I try to retrieve it again just to be done with it but it wont come up.

Yesterday, I took the wrong bus back home. It was almost 9:30 PM and I figured it out when the route was different and we started to get into deep dark areas of the city. I started to have thoughts about how, everyone will get off, the bus driver will rape and throw me in the middle of the street. I started to calculate how will I get a taxi back home? Or will I be let go if it was the end of the shift for this driver? It started to become a gloomy ride for me. I eventually got the courage to speak to him. I told him that I am not from the area and I don’t speak the language well. I am lost. He was nice enough to assure me that he will get me off at the terminal and which other bus I should take. 
Of course none of my fears happened by the Grace of God. In fact, the driver was a nice guy, he let me off in the terminal in a live area with lots of people and I took the other bus back. The other driver actually called me and told me where to get off. I walked few blocks back safely. I didnt even pay for another ticket because my ticket was still valid. 

How to learn to trust? Because everytime I try to think it went well, a voice in me tells me “not to take it for granted.”

1,"How to deal with my sister stoically? So my sister is a very lazy sort of parasite wether she likes it or not. We have two bunnies that we keep in a cage inside our bathroom during the night. She was the one who insisted on bringing them. She wakes up at 12am (confined this she thinks she can sleep till said hour) and takes them to breath in fresh air to the balcony at said hour maybe even later. They take turns inside and outside the cage while they are at the balcony since the boy has to wait three wakes after surgery to ensure he doesn't impregnate the female.

In total they spend 20 hours inside a cage, 16 of them inside an enclosed bathroom

If she woke up at at 8am they could be more than four hours at the balcony breathing fresh air. But she doesn't.

Due to my family giving positive in covid except my sister, my mum is sick and I have to do the dishes, the floor, all the house chores except my sister's room.

My sister literally doesn't do shit, she stays in her room, plays on her phone, blames me for passing on the virus to my mother who is currently very sick. Doesn't do the dishes, when I asked her two days ago to do my mother's bed (in which she sleeps/lies all day despite my mother testing positive) . She never did it, next day I told her the same thing, she didn't do it either, she is the only being that gets me on my nerves.

Insisted and told her to stop being a lazy useless fuck for once and atleast to do their bed. She lazily didn't even change/place the sheets individually and scruffily placed them on the top of the bed.

Also when I insisted she insulted me, shouted and called me a cunt for being so annoying. I have my own life, I have to study, workout, meditate, do all the chores and she doesn't do shit, she can't even treat the bunnies correctly.

When I tell my parents, she immediately comes downstairs shouting denying literally everything I say and insulting me in front of them. My parents who are quite old mostly don't give a fuck about what I say and they tell me to shut the fuck up caus ethey don't wanna hear her squeaky annoying screams. Despite everything I say they just tell me to shut up and leave her alone.

Also she doesn't even eat lunch or dinner with us, she is practically starving herself on a smoothie diet cause she doesn't know about caloric density and macronutrients. My parents don't tell her anything because they know she doesn't do shit and that she'll start screaming again

Please help me I don't know how to keep up with the house, my studies, my nutrition and everything if I can't find the time for them since I have to do everything. She is also the only being that irritates me, I'm usually very laid-back and chill but her attitude and selfishness really does put me off"

1,"reflection of the day &gt; ""Remember that men lives only in the present, in this fleeting instant: all the rest of his life is either past and gone, or yet not revealed."" - Meditations 3.10 

&amp;#x200B;

Well, well, well... I guess we all escape sometimes from our current life and dream of the future and/or alternative scapes of our past. 

&amp;#x200B;

My point is: past and future aren't real. The only real we have is ""here and now"". Live in the here and now. Don't waste your precious time concerning yourself with the future. 

Marcus Aurelius speaks of this often:

&gt; ""Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present. – Meditations 7.8"" 

&amp;#x200B;

If you meet the future, you'll be just fine. You endure it as you have been enduring the present. Thinking and planning it is a 'life lie'. Everything will change and you cannot control that change.

About the past, what is done is done. All mistakes you have done don't matter anymore. The only thing that matters is learning from them and being a better person. Always value courage, justice, wisdom, and peace of mind. Reason above all.

SO.....

Have the **courage** not to think of the future that lies ahead and not to imagine alternatives past. Have the **peace of mind** of a being that lives in the 'here and now'."

1,"Yearning for a relationship I feel some shame as I write what's been plaguing me for a while now. I was raised in an environment that encouraged fortitude. But I never realised that my tolerance had devolved into braggadocio. This urge to be thought of as a mountain of courage led me to wallop my emotions. And that glop of suppresed emotions curdled into discontentment. 

I've lived a mundane life with with an iota of unrestrained glamour. Never dated since I wasn't even remotely close to what women my age desired. Atrociously short(5'2"") I struggled, flailed and then sank. Was told wittiness would help distinguish myself. I became a dancing monkey with an abhorrence for what I stood for.
My friends manage to have meaningful relationships without much effort. They handle it with such grace that I'm overcome with awe.

A part of me yearns for that indescribably intimate emotional plane. A relationship where I feel renewed, one where I'm allowed to be vulnerable and one where I'm sure someone has my back.

To be thought of as a subpar human is hurtful. I've had some people tell me not many would be interested in me. These thoughts often stagger me by their poison.

I see men and women around me who seem to have an abundance of options. Smouldering good looks seem to help quite a bit.

Excuse me for this ramble. But it was important for me to get a frank view to cure my angst and develop a buoyancy for life."

So I’m wondering how I can go on about my day, because  it still kinda hurts me. 

Examples:

1,"I am too sensitive-Easily frustrated/hurt-How can I be stronger mentally  

Hi,

I posted this on r/Advice as well but I was advise to post it in here as well, hope this is an appropriate subreddit for it. 

Anyone have advice/tips on how to be less sensitive to criticism or even if things don't go your way?

Like, today, my dad called me out for being loud when eating but I am telling you guys I close my mouth every single time when I am eating. It's just that, I was eating a bit fast today but I had my mouth completely shut. So, I guess he heard some low sounds due to me eating fast(with mouth shut tight).

It made me so mad when he said that because he is the one who blatantly opens his mouth when eating. My mum has told him to close his mouth as well and I have as well but he won't listen.

Anyway, the point is, I got so mad, like, I felt so much anger, I was burning. Thankfully I was able to leave the dinning room without exploding. Got mad to the point that it almost made me tear up.

So, I need some help with this. I really want to stop feeling so sensitive to things.

My mum tends to compare me to others and that really hurts me as well. But I want to learn how to be less sensitive to that.

How can I have a stronger mindset? How can I be mentally strong? How can I improve my mental strength?

1,"How does a Stoic apologize? Maybe I'm overthinking this, but I must confess, I wronged my exgf long ago. I emotionally abused her, used her as a means of fulfilling my boredom. And I used excuses and lies to escape the situation once i was confronted. And by no means am I providing an excuse, but I was young, full of apathy and hatred. And after embracing Stoicism recently, I can't help myself but to apologize to her, truly. However, I'm afraid I might escalate the situation, creating a problem when there wasn't one to begin with( this was almost 3 years ago). Should I learn from my wrong doings and move on? Any tip would be helpful. Thanks."

1,"My thoughts on fate after reading stoic commentaries. Its true that fate has jurisdiction over your birth and death. It can also be argued that fate confines you within some realm of possibilities throughout your life. The mistake that we mortals often make is focus a lot on what fate has snatched away from us and the possibilities if the thing was given to you. The moment we shift our focus away from the confinements enforced by fate we realize that the realm in itself is infinite. I conclude my rambling by stating the obvious : All men are not gifted with an equal playground, but everyone is given infinite possibilities for pursuing happiness."
1,"How much control do we really have over our actions/desires? A lot of the solace of stoicism seems to come from clearly separating the things we have control over from the things we don't. Things like actions and desires usually fall into the ""things we have control over"" pile, but it isn't always so clear cut.

&amp;#x200B;

An example of this is in the case of addiction. Addicts occasionally feel as if they have lost control of their behaviour, and they certainly desire things they don't want to desire. As such, they can't simply ""stop desiring"" the object of the addiction, and similarly cannot be counted on to never indulge in the addition again (always be in control).

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, however, they can't completely renounce control over their actions and desires, especially addicts who are intent on ""going sober"", because it's an ongoing process of eliminating or reducing triggers, developing more self-control, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

It's possible that an understanding of the psychology of addiction wasn't well-developed when stoicism was being conceived, but the same concepts can be seen in someone who is infatuated by someone they know isn't good for them and they don't want to want, a phenomena which probably was around at that time.

&amp;#x200B;

More generally, what proof is there that every aspect of our existence is either fully within or fully without our control? How does stoicism regard things which we can't say for sure are in one or the other realms?"

1,"Nietzsche and Stoicism So I've heard Nietzsche was critical of Stoicism, claiming that the Stoics numb themselves to life, and therefore Stoicism was a life-denying philosophy. 

Not only does that seem to be a misinterpretation of what Stoicism really is... it seems Nietzsche shared at least some Stoic beliefs. 

For instance, I found a quote from Nietzsche saying ""There are no facts, only interpretations,"" which is identical to what Epictetus taught. 

I don't know if Nietzche simply had a misconception about Stoicism but it seems like his philosophy was fairly in line with that of the Stoics, or at least parts of it (probably not-so-much providence and other more metaphysical Ancient stoic concepts... but at least in practice)."
1,"The road towards excellence leads far from comforts and pleasures. Like Hercules at the crossroads of life, the choice is laid out plainly. Virtue requires sacrifice - your comfort, your peace of mind, your innocence and blissful ignorance, they have to be put aside for the time being. But you want to be free from anything stressful - what they called aponia and ataraxia. The lack of pain and distress, but for these comforts they sacrificed any hard work, dutiful labor, or any long due reformation. Think hard about this distinction: The goal is to be excellent, to be a great person - even at the cost of some stress or inconvenience. Those who would rather choose Aphrodite over Hera, and those who hear the advice of Athena are of a different breed."

1,"One of my biggest tests just happened at my job today. Just started at a dealership and quit my last job (retail). Working at a dealership because I have an infinite love for the automotive and I consider cars to be one of my elements so this job I love.

Today. I parked a car behind the fence of the dealership (we do this when there's no more room on the lot). I backed the car up just enough to make room for anyone else that needs to park back there (I do this all the time) But this time I did it far enough to smack the rear bumper on the fence. I hop out and I saw that I did leave a scratch and a small dent behind. Told the head of my position and he told me ''accidents happen''. We notified our manager and he was upset (understandably so) the cars over $100k (Range Rover) and the owner is one of the most anal over small details (And I have no problem giving her an apology). I told him sorry and he gave me his spill and then later he told me I was on his ""shit list"". This is a dude that I have a lot of respect and love for and I appreciate him for all his high praise and good talk of me for the month that I've been working there. But even I know the event that took place and the way how he reacted towards it were both completely out of my power and I chose not to lose myself over either. If I was or will get fired over this it will be out of my control. If I never end up getting fulltime for the two years that I'm planning on staying there then that is also out of my control. I chose and only chose to leave it up to nature. Because me, an event, and the ones affected by the event aren't going to last forever. And that's my reality."

1,"""Why worry? If you've done the best you've can, worrying won't make it any better."" -Walt Disney I just wanted to share this quote I discovered from Walt Disney long before I discovered the existence of Stoicism, and it's helped me tremendously during my anxious High School Phase that everyone goes through at that age. It had become some sort of a mantra and most likely is the start of my Stoic journey long before I knew what it was.

When I did learn about Stoicism a few years ago, it clicked great with my way of thinking and I've got to say has greatly improved my way of life. I do not regret this journey I started and this subreddit has played a big part in developing myself as a stoic.

That's all, thank you for listening to me ramble about a Walt Disney quote. Hope you all have a nice day and keep safe!

1,"The silent stoicism of masculinity I find myself thinking much on the concept of masculinity of late. The security guard drinking coffee on his break, the roadman at the petrol station, the cop grabbing a sausage roll for his partner. It would be that previously i would look and simply see the man but now when I look i can't help but wonder about these men. I wonder who they truly are, i wonder what it means to be a man, where is masculinities place in our society. These things we've come to despise yet depend so very much on, these are the men who rise everyday still tired from the nights work and struggle forward having no more answers than anyone else but the courage struggle no less. How we fail to shine a light on these few men yet never fail to plaster our media when one of them falls or looses his way. I find no excuse for those who camouflage their failings with aggression and bravado but i can't help but grieve for the little boys who could have been great men that never were, that never managed to embrace the weight of the word. The little boy who never learned that his devine calling of purpose was to be the person people could rely on, the one to lock the doors at night, the one to investigate the noise in the darkness, the one to brave the cold and the rain, the one to make walk into the fire, the one to make the arrangements for his farthers funeral and as a final act of toxic masculinity, the one to show his son that he too, could be great like his farther."
1,"I'm broke. Is therapy a waste of money? edit: please be aware that this post does mention suicide.

I'm in a tough spot right now, and the environment I'm in makes me want to end my life pretty much on a near-daily basis. Usually it's something like ""wow this is hopeless, nothing will ever change, I could just escape all these problems if I weren't alive, maybe today I finally do it"" but I feel deep down I know that it is my responsibility to act in harmony with nature, and this is not in accordance with nature. Also, I'm honestly too afraid to do it. There are times it's escalated and I had everything prepared to die, but again, too afraid. I really want to seek therapy for not only this but also a lot of other things I'm not comfortable sharing with anyone.

Therapy costs money. I have very little money. I know the philosophy of Stoicism is supposed to be my ""medicine"". I've used it for the past few years, and I have so little sadness/anger within me. This whole suicide thing is a more recent thing, and I attribute it to the following: I thought I was supposed to go off to college and be able to escape this environment. It was the pandemic, having to take a gap semester, and realizing that I'm still going to be dependent on my parents that made me feel like garbage, like nothing would ever change and I would always be this way with no escape from it. I had been in this environment for years, and with Stoicism as my ""medicine"", I have prevailed in maintaining my satisfaction and gratitude, but I always expected to leave around when I turned 18. Now that it's not panning out that way, despite having expected it to for years (my mistake), I feel pretty bad. I guess I'm asking, is therapy really worth it when Stoicism is supposed to be my ""medicine""? If I just followed Stoicism more strictly, which I once did for a while with great results, I could save the money on therapy for living expenses. What do you think?"
1,"Stoicism in the Falling Leaves This past Veteran's Day I was off of work and spent the day at home. It was one of those classic fall days: overcast and breezy with a slow, steady rain. The leaves were falling almost as steady as the rain and as I looked out of the window I had this thought; If a man is lucky he gets to see the leaves fall  maybe 80 times in his life.  As for me, I'm half way to my ""lucky"" number of 80. In fact its likely that I have fewer autumns left to experience than I have already been fortunate enough to see. In my youth I barely acknowledged the changing seasons, but as I grow older I appreciate these seemingly mundane experiences that I used to take for granted.

“Everything harmonizes with me which is harmonious to thee, O Universe. Nothing for me is too early nor too late, which is in due time for thee. Everything is fruit to me which thy season brings, O Nature: from thee are all things, in thee are all things, to thee all things return.”― **Marcus Aurelius**"

I wonder your interpretation of this.

Mine is: whenever one thinks, and thinks again (using their reason), there is nothing in this world that could hurt you. Nothing but your reason can hurt you unless you allow them to. And the only change you allow them to in when you don't reason.

Therefore, reasoning and the act of reasoning are self-sufficient faculties (meditations not sure where).

1,"Existential threats Here is something I would like to hear Stoic thoughts about... I often think about existential threats and was wondering how Stoics approach these topics. Stoic texts talk a lot about things like war, tyranny, injustice and how to deal with them. I have not yet been personally confronted with them, but I think I can follow the logic of the Stoic approach against these situations. Existential threats, on the other hand, is not something I have come across in Stoic literature yet.

Interestingly, I think/feel very differently about different types of threat. For example, the thought of a major natural catastrophe, like a giant asteroid impact, is not something that usually worries me. If it happens, it happens, there is nothing we can do about it.

Then there is climate change and the risk of Earth becoming uninhabitable for humans. This concerns me, but at the same time, it seems that there is a lot that we as a society still can do about it. So I see it as a motivator to act rather than a cause for despair.

Something I feel very differently about is the threat of nuclear war. No matter how I look at it, I cannot see how I would view this threat with equanimity. I think that I am concerned not only about the consequences, but also scared of witnessing such a colossal moral failure.

I am a bit familiar with Stoicism, but still struggle to understand the idea of providence. As far as I understood it, the universe was considered as ""good"" because it allows humans to live and flourish, is this a correct interpretation? How does this square with the fact that the same universe gave us the means to alter the conditions on Earth to the extent that it may become uninhabitable for us?

Did any of the ancient Stoics consider the possibility that the foundations of human life might one day be destroyed (through human actions or other causes)? Or are you aware of modern Stoics who wrote about these issues? How do you approach them personally? Looking forward to an interesting discussion!"

1,"To what level should indifference be taken? Most of the Stoics of ancient Greece said that you shouldn't try to control what is out of your control. Whilst this is a good rule, it just seems more more complicated than it actually sounds. If someone punches you, should you punch them back, even if they just punched you once? You can't control if they punch you or not but you could, in theory, kill them to stop it from happening again. Obviously, that would be extreme. If someone is listening to loud music next to you, you can't stop them, unless you were to do so physically. What I'm trying to say is, how much should you ignore and how much should you control? Almost everything can be controlled if you take extreme measures to do so. The problem is that if you let anyone do anything to you and remain indifferent, aren't you a pushover? Epictetus says something in the Enchiridion about allowing your land to be stolen from you and thinking of it as being ""donated"" back to where it came from. But if everyone acted like this, then the whole world would be a den of unprosecuted, free-roaming thieves and stoical pushovers. So, how far should we remain indifferent when faced with problems caused by other people?"
1,"Discussion about memento mori Hello, I would like to hear how fellow stoics that practice and find value in memento mori and how you are reasoning, I myself have trouble identifying and connect with it.

Memento mori -remembering that you are dying.

I’m not sure if my imagination is weak, but to me the concept of my own death is so abstract and therefor for long been something I’m at peace with already. 

If I understand the exercise correctly it’s a mean of appreciating what you currently have, as it might end at any time. 

The chance to meet a friend, might be the last, the chance to kiss a loved on might be the last.

It’s like I can understand and value that things might be taken away from me, or rather returned . However I cant really grasp that I might be the thing that gets taken away, are you following? It’s find it hard to describe but essentially I get a philosophical value out of remembering that others might die, leave or in other means disappear from me but to think about my own death, it does nothing to me as I can’t really grasp it, in the same way as I can’t really grasp that the universe has no edges.

1,"Revenge by Taha Muhammad Ali At times … I wish

I could meet in a duel

the man who killed my father

and razed our home,

expelling me

into

a narrow country.

And if he killed me,

I’d rest at last,

and if I were ready—

I would take my revenge!

*

But if it came to light,

when my rival appeared,

that he had a mother

waiting for him,

or a father who’d put

his right hand over

the heart’s place in his chest

whenever his son was late

even by just a quarter-hour

for a meeting they’d set—

then I would not kill him,

even if I could.

*

Likewise … I

would not murder him

if it were soon made clear

that he had a brother or sisters

who loved him and constantly longed to see him.

Or if he had a wife to greet him

and children who

couldn’t bear his absence

and whom his gifts would thrill.

Or if he had

friends or companions,

neighbors he knew

or allies from prison

or a hospital room,

or classmates from his school…

asking about him

and sending him regards.

*

But if he turned 

out to be on his own — 

cut off like a branch from a tree — 

without a mother or father, 

with neither a brother nor sister, 

wifeless, without a child, 

and without kin or neighbours or friends, 

colleagues or companions, 

then I’d add not a thing to his pain 

within that aloneness — 

not the torment of death, 

and not the sorrow of passing away. 

Instead I’d be content 

to ignore him when I passed him by

on the street — as I 

convinced myself 

that paying him no attention 

in itself was a kind of revenge.

&amp;nbsp;

Taha Muhammad Ali was a Palestinian poet, here he reads *Revenge*: https://youtu.be/2raT_w83Mhk. As far as I know, he was not a Stoic, but he deals with the desire for revenge expertly in this beautiful poem."
1,"I think the stoic preach of differentiating between ""what we can change and what we can’t"" is not only a great lesson for acceptance, but a tremendous motivator as well Now and then i see quotes and discussions about the topic of ""what is under our control"" and most of the time, people really talk over accepting what is not under our control. While I think this is a very solid message for itself, the part about identifying what is under our control and what we can change is another important task for self-improvement.

The moment you let go of things which you know you can't control, you can focus over things you can. Usually i see this aplication as self acceptance (""you can't control if it will rain tomorrow but you can control how you will feel about the rain""). Again, while i feel this is a valuable lesson, there can be a lot of other things you can change about the issue other than just you reaction to it. 

From the moment i started let go of what i can't control, i saw there is a LOT of things i can control. Usually we don't percive this because we are so immersed in our own rumination about things we cannot change. There is also the fact that most of times the path of changing things is a arduous one, but hard or not, it is whitin our power to walk it over.

I'm sorry if my reasoning sounds to you like a cheap motivotional message, but for me stoicism is also a lesson about doing all we can in the most virtous way


“Do not think that what is hard for you to master is humanly impossible; and if it is humanly possible, consider it to be within your reach.”

1,"Never feeling alone Hello fellow aspiring stoics! I have been wondering recently about ways to create such a connection with yourself that you will never feel alone or lonely, as if you are keeping your own self company. Do any of you have some experience with this? If so, how did you achieve this, and if you don’t, what are your thoughts on this?"

1,I’m new to Stoicism. But I thought this fit? 
1,"What really is ‘unjust’? The four pillars of virtue in Stoicism is justice, courage, moderation and wisdom. 

However, someone could call out an act and call it ‘unjust’ which is therefore contrary to virtue. But another can question, ‘Is that, though, really unjust?’ For example the art of ignoring someone, or not using your manners in public. 

Well, I suppose it just takes a little logic and perhaps common sense to determine that?"

1,"How your perception of what is 'right' can sabotage you There's a quote from taoism ""Bend and be straight"".  I think it meant that if you are yourself wrong/perversed, the right thing to do would feel wrong/perversed to you.  Too much of a good thing is a bad thing, and sometimes what you need is to reduce that good thing, and it will feel wrong to do.  It will feel as if you're going the dark path, when in reality you are seeking balance.  
  
For example, if you think that you have too much pride and want to correct it, you must know what 'changing' entails.  It entails you feeling like you're letting everyone walk over you.  It will feel wrong, it will feel perversed.  But you're not really letting anyone walk over you, you just feel so because you have too much pride.   Hence, if you are not ready to feel 'wrong', your perception of what is right would prevent you to change in that direction.   

  
Let's say that you are lazy.  And you've identified the cause is because you think that smart people would not try so hard, that trying too hard is for fools, or that you think that doing things with too much effort diminish the accomplishment, or something like that.  If you are this person, working hard would feel like becoming a fool, a mediocrity, a time waster.  If you want to change it, be ready to feel like you are wasting your time, just like the 'fools' do.  However wrong this would feel to you, in reality you are just too lazy before.   
  
The last example which i like is imagine a person who is spending too much time on social media, or reddit.  To stop doing that would feel to him as if he is alone in the world, like he is in the dark, and that he is missing important things.  When in actuality he was just using those things too much before.  
  


Of course, if you are already an individual with a healthy mind, you can follow what you feel is right.  However, if you are 'sick' in any way, like most people, don't just follow that feeling, but be critical of it."

I’m afflicted with addiction. I speak badly of people for laughs and personal gain. I act like a fool for the same reason. I’m a hard working lazy man, I take short cuts wherever possible. I breakdown during even the smallest inconvenience. I live a very disgusting life.

I don’t want to live like this anymore, but I feel like if I stop many people will no longer like me. The reason I’ve made it so far is by being this goofball of a human. I just can’t wear this mask anymore.

During a breakup I got interested in philosophy and “Meditations” helped me immensely with how I felt, but none of the teachings never turn to action.

I have many relationships in my personal life and at work that clash. I have betrayed many of my friends and I just can’t stand to see it happen anymore.

I want to be calm, cool, and collected. I want to be the person my girlfriend can always rely on. I want to be the person my friends can rely on. I want to be the person I can rely on. 

Instead of making my usual call to the suicide hotline to talk to anyone I don’t know about my issues, I come to the stoics to hopefully set me on the right path."

1,"What are some good ways to represent stoicism and suffering in an artistic manner? I am currently working on a creative project for my philosophy class. I want to know what is the best way to represent pain and suffering through the eyes of a stoic?

I have a personal philosophy that aligns quite a bit with stoicism, it's not exact but there are similarities. I developed this mentality in my early teenage years to cope with my suffering. Back when I was 2 years old, 65% of my body got burned in a house fire. This incident means I will always suffer through infections, pain, discomfort, and disfigurements. I am indifferent about the suffering as long as I continue to move forward with my life. I am about to the first in my family to graduate from college, Whoop!

I need help representing some of that in an art piece, I am not a very creative person. I am currently thinking of drawing myself in a position somewhat similar to Socrates in The Death of Socrates, while flames burn my body to represent the pain that I still suffer due to the accident. In the flames, there will be a faint shape of Death looking down at me. One of my arms will be out to my side allowing Death to take me if she so chooses. On my other hand, there will be a simple gold ring representing my strive for education.

Does this adequately express stoicism? If not what can I change?"

1,"What do you all believe in the way of the Stoic prospective on anger I have found some stoic prospectives to be incredibly helpful and liberating, however, some I have found to hold contradictions. The stoic prospective on anger has conflicted me for a long time. On one hand the idea that anger is derived from a sense of being wronged and therefore letting go of that sense of external violation seems helpful and reasonable but on the other hand saying that anger has no purpose and that it is wrong from a stoic point of view seems dishonest and unnatural. The origin of the initial anger may violate a stoic principle but to label an entire emotion as morally wrong or useless is a dangerous thing. This especially trips me up given many stoics say that they are trying to live in accordance to nature yet condemn anger which is a very natural thing"

1,"How do I prevent myself from getting power drunk? Last weekend before a wild night out—drinks, drugs, sex, you name it—I bumped into a monk getting some gum at the store. He immediately grabbed my attention because I've always been so curious about that path of life. But once I looked at him, in order to start some form of rapport, he couldn't even look at me in the eye. In fact he looked away when I looked at him. And it broke my heart. I'm pretty sure he felt my vibes. An enlightened soul whose lost his way.
  
I feel like I'm lost in the sauce. Years ago, when I was unemployed, I spent a whole year meditating and finding myself. It was one of the most profound experiences of my life. I felt spiritual bliss all that year. But now I'm totally different. Now I'm ""playing the game"". The society that monks so detach themselves from. And in this game, you need some form of ego. I want to be the exception to the rule of ""absolute power corrupts absolutely."" But how do I do that?"

If the opinion of others people is the only thing keeping you alive, its a very dangerous path. Wich i know because ive walked on it. What do you people think? Is it a good thing to say to a suïcidal person that they shouldnt do it because of others? Of would you guys say something different."
1,"I’ve been doing so well.. apart from yesterday. So I was depressed for the good part of 6 years and then I came across stoicism. It’s made me feel a lot better, made me understand values and morals and proper virtues and understand my emotions and a little about other people as well. It’s made me a lot happier. However, yesterday I couldn’t hold it in anymore and I lashed out and smashed up my outhouse, ripped the blinds off the wall and threw the printer and the hoover out the door and they broke. I knew I was having a bad day and I just wanted to print a photo of my great grandad (from ww1) out as it’s been restored, but the printer said there’s no paper when there was and I let it get to me, so I threw it, mum came in and shouted and said “you’re just like Derrick  (abusive ex-stepdad), and I just lost myself totally. I’ve been doing so well for so long and maybe it’s a lot of things built up like a second lockdown (I live in the U.K) and it doesn’t help being autistic I know, what can I do to be better?

1,"Does stoicism have anything to say about disputes with neighbors? I am having a real problem with my upstairs neighbor and I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts on a stoic approach to dealing with him.

The main problem is, he's loud, and loud at hours when I'm trying to sleep. I tried to talk to him very nicely about it and he got upset, yelled at me, and since then has been even louder. Unfortunately, I live in a building where the sound travels quite a bit into apartments below, so it can be quite disruptive.

But it goes beyond noise, as now he glares at me if we pass each other, and I have been told that he gossips about me to other neighbors. I find it very uncomfortable living in the same building as a person who is so hostile toward me.

The good news is I'm probably going to be moving fairly soon so this is a short-term problem. But do the stoics have any advice that may help me get through this short term?"
1,"Can some things you not get over/forgive but move on from? So I've always thought that if I can't forgive someone for something or get over a situation I have to really deal with it and find a way to get over it. And this might be true?  


But there's certain situation in my life I haven't been able to get over for years even with trying.   


My boyfriend cheated on me and is now happy in the relationship. I don't want him back or anything. I'm so focused on my life but when his name is ever brought up I feel kind of embarrassed. Like I'd prefer to never speak of him again and move on in this way.   


Although I've heard this is like running from your problems but I've been to therapy, I've tried to sort this in my own head for years and along the way I've become a WAY better person with my lifestyle/health etc and wouldn't even go for someone like him anymore but yet I still feel like this embarassment.   


TLDR/Ending line:   


Is it ok to just accept this and carry on with my life rather than always thinking I've got to put this thing to bed some how. Maybe time will just heal that wound? It's not like I think about it all the time, just when brought up."

1,"Hard to enjoy life, when I'm feeling like I'm walking on a tightrope Hello, I'm a grade 11 student currently doing e-learning. Due to personal reasons I started my courses a month later. When it came to choosing my courses, I wasn't given a choice, and my e-learning school gave me arguably the courses that require the most work. 

I have been getting good grades in the past, still putting in good amount of effort and still having time to read, develop on things I like, etc. Nowadays, I'm always under constant stress whether if I can even finish the course on time. Good grades are also crucial for me to get to a university that I hope to go, but the teachers seem uncooperative and the courses seems inefficiently designed...

For my recent social studies test, I got the worst mark I've gotten in almost 5 years (which I even studied hard for). After a rigorous day of work, I don't go to sleep feeling happy of how much I was accomplished today, but how I'm on a tightrope to get good grades for success, and how tomorrow the same day is continue, and again and again. 

I have no time to read books that I want to, or do other activities really. I fear that I might start blaming other things again such as blaming teachers, my parents, etc..

Maybe it is just me talking about my situation, but I also don't have anyone to talk to. I don't want to act as if I am the most miserable person on earth, but it's hard for me even if I try to hold on. I really need help or any tips or suggestions would really be helpful. How would you advise me to get through this? I fear that I might even lose interest in studying...

Thanks everyone"

1,"The Unus Annus youtube channel If you don't know, the channel ""Unus Annus"" on youtube deleted their channel around an hour ago, along with 4.5 million subscribers and 300+ videos. The channel was an experiment between Mark Fischbach ""Markiplier"" and Ethan Nestor ""CrankGameplays"" in posting a video of them trying something new everyday for 365 days and then deleting the channel after than time period. The true message of the channel was to spread the teaching that time is limited and that we all have to die, and I think that really resonates with stoic thought and reached out to millions of people and put them along a more stoic response to death itself, not to fear it and live everyday as if it were your last. Their slogan even ""Momento Mori."" I know this may not fit here, but I feel really happy that a much larger community on youtube and twitter is embracing some of stoic teaching.

1,"Thoughts on LaVeyan Satanism (otherwise known as rationalistic satanism or atheistic satanism)? I've been looking into both Stoicism and LaVeyan Satanism for a small while now, and I find myself aligning with views from both ideologies. I know Satanism is painted as ""the big bad"" but the actual ideals (according to Wikipedia) seem really laid back and unbothered, specifically intended to allow you to enjoy life and take pride in your carnal desires/your human nature. 

There are a few things I don't like about Satanism and a few things I don't like about Stoicism, but for the most part they are both very appealing to me and match my train of thought well. I agree with LaVeyan Satanism philosophy in the sense that I don't allow any entity or belief system to wholly rule my decisions in life, being an outsider by nature and living as I see fit, and living by my own rules as according to my carnal desire. I also agree with Stoicism's philosophy of non-regret and unbothered-ness. I think they are closer in nature than some would like to admit.

Stoicism and LaVeyan Satanism are close in some regards and far apart in others, I think the biggest difference is Stoics seem more altruistic and self-denying than Satanists tend to be. By no means am I a philosopher, nor am I deep into ideology or theology; I just find both very interesting and I'm not sure if I identify with one or the other or something in-between. I am curious what the thoughts of a real Stoic are towards LaVeyan Satanism."
1,"Language is one of the keys to virtue I learned from the academic texts that ancient stoics was language enthusiasts and created many words that even sounded strange in their times. And that exact of many stoic words we understand wrong and even with deep studies we missed the context. And after reading stoic texts I developed an opinion that articulating stoicism have an important role in our practice. 
“Don’t say that this will harm you, but only body and property” 
“Don’t say that you lost your cup, but instead you give it away, so as your wife and son” 
“Don’t say that this event is misfortune”
So I think it’s very important not to express even in words wrong values and judgments and the more you talk like that with yourself and others, the more virtuous you will be. 
P.S. I don’t advocate to preach stoicism to lay people, I advocate to refuse to talk about things that indifferent as they not."

Weak brick weakens the whole temple, vice choices, thoughts and actions weakens the soul. 
So every day, every night, every hour, every minute and every moment of my existence I will try to think, feel and act with virtue, because only with “right” bricks I will build my temple. Not with any bricks that fate can bring, not with any bricks that other people can give me, not with any bricks that looks good only on the outside and not with bricks that gathered in fear of failure.

1,"My Story I thought I'd share my story about becoming a Stoic, just to provide an illustration of how somebody may think of adopting this philosophy, what kind of obstacles there may be, and how can Stoicism help to improve somebody's life.

My journey began last August, when my girlfriend dumped me after four and a half years. We were dating since we were 16. I kinda saw it coming for a while, I knew that there were some problems in our relationship, but nonetheless the prospect of being alone seemed pretty scary. I'm not very skilled with woman, so my chances of finding someone else seemed pretty slim to me at that time. Which made the situation look even scarier.

My first reaction, being the person I was at the time, was to blame her. I had a pretty clear idea of the whole situation. ""She wasn't good enough. She was always too pessimistic, didn't spend enough time with me, didn't get along with my friends well enough, and she wasn't even trying to change any of her mistakes even though I told her so many times what exactly she can do."" So the idea was clear - she was the one to blame, because she had somebody as perfect as me, but didn't appreciate that. Well, that's alright, I can live on my own, I don't need her.

Well, the problem was that even though I managed to use my anger to convince myself that I don't miss her, I still felt completely lost and clueless about what to do with my life. And as I already said, I felt very lonely and depressed.

I can't really tell you how the idea of trying out Stoicism came to my mind. I might have read about it somewhere or heard about it on Youtube, I might have just remembered that I heard about it some longer time ago. But it somehow came to my mind. All I knew was that it's a philosophy of not caring about circumstances and maintaining an emotionless approach. Yup, I completely fell for the beginners' trap - I confused Stoicism with stoicism. Well, I decided to learn about it on Youtube. And stumbled upon some wrong videos. I got the idea that being Stoic means being an asshole who doesn't care about other people's opinions and about others in general. I also thought that Stoics didn't like being wealthy and that being a Stoic required pretty much living in poverty. I could go on, but I think it suffices to say that there is a lot of misinformation about Stoicism on the internet. Looking back at it, I'd say that some of it might have been people confusing Stoicism and stoicism, another part were people misinterpretting what Stoicism is about or which thoughts are the most important, and the rest was my own misinterpretation, being a complete beginner.

Well, I gave up. Having this improper idea of what Stoicism is, I concluded that it's not for me. For the next few months I just went on with my life, trying to find my own ways to cope with all the stuff that was happening (somewhat succesfuly, but I still felt pretty lonely and had a hard time dealing with it) And then I met with Stoicism again. I stumbled upon a lecture about Marcus Aurelius. And it painted a completely different picture than what I had in mind from my previous research. A picture of a philosophy that's first and foremost about being a good person, about being kind to your fellow humans, and about always doing what's right. It inspired me to find some literature and some more resources and to actually start digging into it. With every new detail I learned I liked the ideas of Stoicism more and more. And it didn't take long and I decided that becoming a Stoic is the right thing to do.

I've now been practicing for a few months. I've seen some major improvements. I'm much less stressed than I used to be. I don't care so much about bad circumstances. I value everything good that happens to me, and I usually manage to find something good about pretty much every bad thing that happens. It feels great. 

After a while, I finally found the courage to think once again about my ex-girlfriend and our relationship, now through the lens of my new philosophy. Remembering all the things that happened, I soon discovered how much of what happened was actually my fault. How unsupportive I was and how little I valued that I even had a girlfriend. I still think she was far from perfect, but I now find it so foolish how I took for granted that I had somebody who actually cared about me (and I know she did). And I find it absolutely disgusting how I was sometimes blaming her for things that neither of us could control. I can't help laughing at the ignorance of my past self.

It's possible that had I discovered Stoicism earlier, we'd still be together. But there's no point thinking about that. I have to presume that it's a good thing that we broke up. And I do. Many good things happened to me since then that wouldn't have happened had I still been in this relationship. 

Now I hope that I managed to learn from my mistakes and if I ever get another chance with some nice girl, I'll be the best boyfriend I can possibly be. Until then I'll keep studying and putting into practice every Stoic exercise I find.

If you're still here, I want to thank you for reading my story. I hope it was at least somewhat interesting. Now I would love to read your story too. What brought you to Stoicism? Did you understand it right away or did you also fall into some beginner traps? What improvements did you register in your life since you started practising? I'd really like to know. Thanks for your attention."

They refused to see reality as reality and face it. They always pray and pray yet nothing changes. It is their work or the whims of fate that will change their life. By which only the former is within their control.

I know, we are all suffering, I do not judge nor despise them. But when I walk into a church and hear them preach the word of god, I suddenly feel uncomfortable, the same kind of feeling you'll feel around insane people.

I hope I'm not being hateful. There's really this indescribable discomfort I feel around religious people."

1,"A gift to myself: A portrait of Marcus Aurelius with Stoic medallions framed in my home office I thought you guys might appreciate this.  [I have this over my desk in my home office.](https://imgur.com/iZ7a2wS)

I tend to work long hours with video calls (as I'm sure many of us are these days) and I started to design something better to put on the wall above my desk.  I downloaded the image of Marcus Aurelius, purchased two copies of each of the Stoic medallions on The Daily Stoic, and walked over to the frame shop in my neighborhood (I live in Chicago).  I think they did a great job.

In terms of cost, I spent about $550.  The Marcus Aurelius image was free from the Web, but I did take it to a printer for a high resolution image print on special paper ($10).  The coins were about $300.  The custom frame was about $250."
1,"To Whoever May Need to Hear This my days all feel the same with no real progression. i want everyday to end with me being able to reflect back and say i’m one step closer to achieving my purpose and goals and that i’m happy with my actions for that day and that I did something to keep my spirit happy and adventurous. I need to break out of the same old rut and change things around and learn to explore things on my own without needing anybody. I need to prioritize my schedule and use my energy efficiently and not waste it away. once time is gone it never comes back, you can’t waste your days away and say “i’ll do it tomorrow” or “there’s always tomorrow so i’ll be better then”. tomorrow is not guaranteed. anything and everything can be snatched away from you in a moments notice. take nothing for granted. your time here is very limited so why are you okay with letting yourself waste it away as if you have a guaranteed abundance of it. make the most out of each day and always make sure that every action you take, you take it with the end in mind and be virtuous. don’t waste another second feeling sorry for yourself, your circumstances are up to you to create them, they’re not just going to happen when “the time is right”. go out today and LIVE your life, don’t just simply exist."

1,"Desire and aversion are (not) in our control? Hey guys,

I'm am currently reading the recent published German version of Irvine's Guide to the Good Life.

He claims in Chapter 5 that Epictetus was wrong that desire and aversion are fully in our control.

As examples he uses situations like the craving for ice cream as an impulse or anxiety of spiders. He says we can handle the outcome of these but not the initial feeling.

But in his defence he adds that there might be some of the meaning lost in translation.

This is what I also believe.

I think the meaning of Epictetus is that we must differentiate desire/aversion between evolutionary human related behavior and our ""socially adapted"" behavior.

But even the evolutionary behavior is something which can change over the course of our lives, I think.

Suggesting some examples about myself:
In my past I was a meat loving person whose mouth would water at the look of huge burgers. Now I am a wholefood vegetarian and have nothing but disgust for meals like this.
Another one: Me and my wife are both cancer patients. In the first years and with current recurrences I would suffer numbing fear and anxieties of death. Over the past three years studying mindfulness and - now recently at the beginning - stoicism, even this primal fear for survival can be tamed.

I would like to hear your opinion about this.

Have a great day!"
1,"Without a belief in the Stoic virtues, can you really apply Stoicism to your life? I don't believe in the ethics of virtue, it's a highly subjective list. You can't prescribe an ought from an is.  I don't view anything worthwhile of me contributing to this entropic world. If we could fight entropy , I would, but we can't.

And some say to be an inspiration to others, I should suffer so others can view me as an example. No, thank you

What is virtuous in suffering through chronic pain (my personal experience), you only build mental resilience. That is good if your goal is to build that if everything else falls apart, things like your health.

People with mental illnesses die sooner, people with chronic pain die sooner, people with autoimmune disorders die sooner. I fall in all three groups.

As I age, I experience more cognitive decline, back gets worse and my bones stiff up ([ankylosing spondylitis](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ankylosing-spondylitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354808), I have the antigen for it, don't know if it's developed).

My problems: kyphoscoliosis, neck lordosis, dyspraxia, dyscalculia, ADD, neglected as a child, allergies, skin problems (cystic acne), Raynaud's syndrome, insomnia, anxiety, depression, hands tremors, still did not get the job I was supposed to get, I am depleting the last amounts of money I have.

And to find the creature I cared for 11.5 half years died in pain and I did not have money to send home so that can at least him put out of misery, I AM FUCKING SORRY MY FRIEND... It was my dog. I don't give a fuck how you view that I value a dog that much...

And you may ask, why do I keep posting, well there is this bitch called Hope. Here is what Nietzsche said about it ""Hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of man.""

But I am gonna overpower it soon I hope, life is gonna make me anyways.

Even if I have something to offer to the world, I don't think it's worth it the decline that comes after 25, it's not immediate, but around that age your organism starts to age slowly and with my health that is not going to be pretty. Plus everything in my life would have to be managed around my health, fuck that.

Antidepressants and therapies like CBT are not going to change my health and life situation."

What does fate have in store for me tomorrow? In the equilibrant of life, pain stands at one end and at the centre of it all. No one gets used to pain, but you sure do recognize it each time it comes back around.

Somedays you just drift away in the abyss. What is the meaning of it all?"
1,"Is helping oneself instead of asking help from others, a Stoic trait ? For a long time (maybe since teenage), I've this idea to not take others' help, or inconvenience them, if possible. So I studied by myself, research/figure out things instead of colleagues, going to  self service UIs instead of bothering another human. For me, it's a process that I can control without involving another person, who may or may not have time to help me with it, or in other words adding a bottleneck. It helped me be more self-reliant so I kept with it.

As I only get acquainted with Stoicism few months ago, so I wonder if this is me being Stoic unknowingly ?"
1,"Can this be considered Stoicism Stoicism to me has struggled to gain academic respect due to issues of metaphysics which I want to try and tackle, but I don't know  If i can still be considered a Stoic. I believe like David Hume that because you cannot derive an Ought from an Is living according to nature is an insufficient claim, but I think like Hume that the best way of living is derived from internal moral sense. Thus the providence of the natural(Though not necessarily nature.) is an aspect of the mind. The rest of the universe acts in part probabilistic and part cause and effect and thus lacks intellect or the ability to question why it processes things. Man has an intellect and so when he engages with the indifferent universe, his role in the natural order of things is to attach purpose to this symphony of that which is orderly and that which is random, through the practice of virtue which exists inside him that he uses to create meaning.  Is this still Stoicism ?"
1,Were Stoics teaching Cyclic universe or straight up Eternal return? Thank!
1,"This passage, I feel, perfectly sums up Stoicism in a bit more elaboration than ""What is and isn't in our control"" In Epictetus's Discourses, Book 2, Chapter 5, Epictetus lays out one of the most profound paragraph on Stoicism I've seen.

&gt; ""What then? Should we use such things carelessly?"" In no way: for  this on the other hand is bad for the faculty of the will, and consequently  against nature; but we should act carefully because the use is not indifferent  and we should also act with firmness and freedom from perturbations because  the material is indifferent. For where the material is not indifferent,  there no man can hinder me nor compel me. Where I can be hindered and compelled  the obtaining of those things is not in my power, nor is it good or bad;  but the use is either bad or good, and the use is in my power. But it is  difficult to mingle and to bring together these two things, the carefulness  of him who is affected by the matter and the firmness of him who has no  regard for it; but it is not impossible; and if it is, happiness is impossible.  But we should act as we do in the case of a voyage. What can I do? I can  choose the master of the ship, the sailors, the day, the opportunity. Then  comes a storm. What more have I to care for? for my part is done. The business  belongs to another- the master. But the ship is sinking- what then have  I to do? I do the only things that I can, not to be drowned full of fear,  nor screaming, nor blaming God, but knowing that what has been produced  must also perish: for I am not an immortal being, but a man, a part of  the whole, as an hour is a part of the day: I must be present like the  hour, and past like the hour. What difference, then, does it make to me  how I pass away, whether by being suffocated or by a fever, for I must  pass through some such means?"

1,"Affirmations: Suggestions? Anyone use affirmations to get them out of the wrong mindstate?

I saw a while back the idea of recording yourself saying the affirmations, put some background music to it, and listen to them regularly. It serves to replace your semi-conscious thought processes that are self-defeating with self-edifying thoughts. I did it before but wanna upgrade them with some more useful thoughts.

I was brain-storming some thoughts that I want to impant in my subconscious and wanted to get feedback on them, suggestions for things I'm overlooking, as well as provide ideas for you all to do the same for yourself.

Here they are: 

* You are safe now, breathe deeply and revel in your cocoon of safety and warmth in the present moment.

* Take a deep breath and enjoy the experience of your body breathing in this very moment

* You are a creator, not a consumer. Don’t waste your time entertaining yourself when you can entertain others.

* You are an EXTREMELY fortunate person. Let you count the ways.

* Transition mindfully, going into the next situation not distracting yourself from the present, but engaging with it

* What is your vision for the life you want to live? Are you working to make it a reality right now?

* What are your goals this week? Today? Right now? What are you doing to work toward them?

* Are you in an emotional flashback right now? What do you need to re-center?

* What did you write today?

* Life is supposed to be a challenge; are you handling it with aplomb? Or are you acting unskillfully?

* Are you present at present?

* How are you making this moment special?

* Are you making sure to laugh at the absurdity of it all, or are you letting it get to you?

* What are you grateful for right now? Who are you grateful for? What is beautiful at present?

* What can you do to make the next hour the best hour that it can possibly be?

* What is your inner critic judging you for right now? What can you say back to him to disempower him?

* Who have you been unfairly critical of today? What was a better way to respond to their actions? What can you do to be nonjudgemental?

* When was the last time you were angry? Good, let’s extend the streak! Remember: Getting angry involves a fundamental misunderstanding of life and only serves to undermine your well-being

* No one has intentionally harmed you, and if they did, it was because “they knew not what they did”, so forgive them and move forward unburdened by vitriol

* Have you meditated today? Why not meditate right now?

* Prioritize your own well-being over and above all else, because you cannot be the best self you can be without doing so

* What have you done to take care of yourself today?

* When was the last time you exercised? Did yoga? Exercised? What can you do right now to improve your health?

* What past experience has bogged you down recently? Did you speak back to it and let it go successfully?

* Have you written a poem today? If not, how about right now?

* What have you done today to make a brighter future for your babies?

* What have you done to create a better tomorrow than yesterday?

* What have you done to make your vision and goals become a reality?"
1,"Are we asked to be social and maintain close relationships with others? I've become more introverted as I've gotten older and now with the pandemic I have seen how much I prefer being left alone. Not having to worry about constant social obligations or maintaining relationships with so many people has relieved me of a lot of stress and given me time to focus on other things. I value these relationships with family and friends but am contemplating keeping some of this distance once quarantine is lifted. 

I'd prefer to check in and visit with loved ones monthly, not weekly. If I do this it is going to hurt feelings and will mean I become a no show to many family events (husband and I have large families) and that I will have to avoid returning constant calls/texts or ask them to stop. It will inevitably damage certain relationships that want to be involved in my life but I've had this urge for some time and I can't decide if this is wrong of me to do.

1,"Professions in Hedonistic Society I'm curious to hear thoughts on here about how the values of stoicism can be met whilst working in what is probably(?) a largely hedonistic society today. How might a games developer or a gourmet chef for example, whose purpose is mostly to provide pleasure for the sake of pleasure to others (whilst not good or bad), adopt a philosophy like stoicism that encourages contribution to society. This maybe where my knowledge falls short still, but presumably that contribution to society should be in accordance with values that such pleasures are indifferent and shouldn't be sought after or valued.

From my readings so far there have not been many examples of practicing stoicism in different professions in a modern context. The ancient greek philosophers and Marcus Aurelius clearly had professions that allowed them to have an obvious contribution to society that could reflect their virtues. Is it simply that now in most cases our work is a means to an end and our societal contribution should be outside of work?"

1,"Spending time considering the past or potential future is futile, to be sure, but is one more so? The official line, to be found in a variety of Stoic quotes, boils down to ""The past no longer exists, the future is yet to come"". But something i can't shake is the fact that considering future events seems like it could have some utility, whereas agonizing over what's past is clearly less helpful.

Has anyone here encountered a take from any Stoic philosopher on the marginal utility that spending time considering future events has? Or would the response be that it's too easy to cast our thoughts to the future in ways that aren't helpful?

Setting oneself up for disappointment by imagining a rosy future certainly can happen. But still, you've got to imagine a future you'd like to experience to start working towards building that reality."

1,"My partner didn’t want to be with me anymore, and through Stoicism I learned to be okay with that. Our relationship was never perfect, none ever is. We didn’t necessarily fight, argue or shout but we did have different opinions on how we felt about things, and how we reflected on our differences were perceived. In short, there was a lot of passion between us but our characters did not fit as much as we hoped.

She had been dealing with some very difficult personal circumstances and in my personal opinion she did not deal with them fully or well, and it turned into projection (but thats a separate story). It led her to believe that we were no longer compatible, which I agreed with partially but felt there was still a lot of work we could have done, and we enjoyed many joyous moments even until the end. We aren’t enemies at the end of it.

Maybe she was right, but she did decided it was enough. I was sad for a few weeks, I processed that as it was important, but I also remembered my Stoic teachings.

I couldn’t control how she felt, even if I felt she was wrong. Even now I see its possible I may have just been too hopeful for a way through - but I had to accept her stance. I wanted nothing more than for her to be happy, if that was away from me then so be it.

“If that was away from me then so be it” is the line that got me through it. I’d rather her be happy alone, or elsewhere, than to be unhappy with me. I cared about her too much to try and control things, that was never going to be an option.

It was not my desired outcome but I am at peace with it, and I grateful now more than ever for Stoicism."

1,"On enjoying activities? (11:2) Hello, I've been reading through meditations and one thing that struck me is verse 2 of book 11:

""2. You will despise joyous song and the dance and the combat-at-arms if you disintegrate the tuneful phrase into every one of its notes, and ask yourself about each whether you are its servant; for you will be ashamed. And so you will be if you do what corresponds in the case of the dance in respect of each movement or pose, and the same also in the case of the combat-at-arms. Generally then, excepting virtue and its effects, remember to have recourse to the several parts and by analysis to go on to despise them, and to apply the same process to life as a whole. ""

I understand this has to do with the idea of indifferents, but to me the process which Marcus suggests - split everything up into simpler parts -  denudes them of any meaning / enjoyment.

Especially when contrasted to another one of Marcus' quotes:
""Think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive - to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love""

What is the nature of enjoyment according to the Stoics? I don't agree with the former verse, to me it eliminates the meaningfulness of activities and the phrasing ""go on to despise them"" does not sound like enjoying being alive, and seems like it cheapens existence by reducing it to it's banal details.
I understand the ""Virtue is the only good"" though I'm not sure I agree with it in this context."

I've been learning and practicing Stoicism for a couple years now, however when I began to learn about Stoicism, and see it's principles, I was reluctant to actually practice it for a good while. 

So now, while I'm finally a more practical Stoic in my day to day, I saw this illness as an opportunity to truly be indifferent upon my condition. In this state, I had a sort of epiphany. While we commonly are in a comfortable position, we don't realize how much of a blessing it is to find comfort, physically and mentally.

And, as a Stoic, I've found that being uncomfortable in whatever position you lay, is also a blessing. For when the body is ill and hurt, the mind can be stilled, as we know. Now, it is a blessing to be comfortable and feel the pleasure of relaxation, and to be uncomfortable and challenged in whatever way life gives you.

As long as your mind is functional, and thought is there, you can find comfort in any situation. I'm simply grateful that I'm only sick. Something far worse could have happened to me before coming to this thought.

Truly, it is a blessing to breathe, think, and act. As Marcus mentioned."

I'm kinda new to Stoicism. I've been reading about it for a while and I really think it's a way of living that has a lot of value and the potential to radically improve almost every aspect of one's existence.

Now, and this is true of most any philosophy, the success of living Stoicism lies in applying the basic tenets and going back to a set of central principles and perspectives. It's relatively simple, but not necessarily easy. The general feeling I have is that Stoicism and a strict, no-nonsense discipline really go hand in hand.

My question to you then is, how do you maintain that discipline? Do you rely heavily on routines and systems? do you surround yourselves with reminders? do you use artifacts or tokens to recalibrate? do you just reread Meditations every month?

I'd appreciate your perspective on this matter, and would love to learn from your experience practicing Stoicism. Thanks, guys."
1,"Can one be a Stoic AND an Optimistic Nihilist? For those who aren’t familiar, an Optimistic Nihilist is a person who finds freedom in mortality; they see death not as something to fear, but to embrace so you can enjoy your days as best as you can because they are so few and not guaranteed.

Anybody who knows me can pretty much say I am a positive, energetic, friendly person. My boyfriend argues I can’t be a Stoic because I feel so deeply. And he's right about me feeling deeply and outwardly. But when life does throw me absolute steaming piles of shit to manage, or if I do find myself in a pit of despair, I don’t let it damper my entire outlook on life. I take it as it is, I don’t fight it, I don’t complain - I just accept that shit happens and all I can do is move through it. Is that Stoicism? Or am I so far from the mark?

So, what do you think? Can a deeply feeling and expressive person be a stoic? Can an Optimistic Nihilist be a Stoic? Or are the two mutually exclusive?

We had to wait for the official announce which happened 2 day later and it stated that its not needed to check out and we can leave our stuff there.
So its 12 hours wasted time traveling and the cost of the tickets. I mean I'm not mad or anything because luckily I had the free time to do the trip, but its just stupid that we have been through this once already, why couldnt they learn from it..."
1,"How do I deal with Family and Friends not taking Pandemuc Precautions As a nurse, I see the results and horrible deaths of people who contact Covid-19. In my everyday life I am constantly seeing my friends and family not practice social distancing and taking the masking recommendations way too lightly.

I know their decisions are completely out of my control and I should focus on  things I can control, but when group corporation is necessary, this seems impossible."
1,"Tell me about your life before awareness of stoicism Who here lived a wild life burning the candle at both ends before pulling in the reins and trying to lead a stoic life?

I’m in my 30s and I’ve lived an amazing life, I’ve done some wild things and made a ton of mistakes along the way. Stoicism and the virtues surrounding a stoic existence inspire me to change my ways as I move forward in this precious and conscious existence. 

However, sometimes I’m reflect on that Hunter S Thompson quote; 
“Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty well preserved body, but rather to skid broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out and loudly proclaiming
“Wow! What a ride!”

I love that quote and when you analyse the chaos of nature and the very universe in which we exist. Then it resonates perfectly for me.
Why be stoic, calm and still, living an existence void of passionate and risk taking behaviours that challenge fundamental norms....
You can still be kind in nature and good spirited, whilst running wild and free, revelling in the wonders to be absorbed in this precious but fleeting life.....

I’m not suggesting that Hunters quote is a statement to avoid a stoic life and run amok but it definitely suggests taking life by the horns of the proverbial bull and hanging on for dear life while enjoying the ride. 

I’d love to hear other people’s viewpoints"

1,"How can one allow themselves to embrace pure happiness and complete understanding of life? I’ve been studying Stoicism for the past year or so now. Listening to many podcasts, meditating regularly, and just overall being more aware of my emotions and mental wellbeing each and everyday, allowing negative thoughts to “flow” as best as I can. 

Recently I got into my first long distance relationship. This whole experience has brought out emotions that are more powerful then ever before. Anger/love/jealousy/joy all of it is hitting me simultaneously and I cannot navigate this situation mentally without giving myself a headache. I feel as though each decision I make is wrong leading me down huge rabbit holes of fabricated situations that I draw up in my head... as you can imagine this cycle repeats daily.

As much as this situation pains me to endure each day, I know this is only temporary and the bigger picture for me is to take this as a learning experience, and understand how to control these very strong emotions. 

If anyone has tips or practices they think will help please comment!!"
1,"Stoicism and Burnout Hey everyone, I have been reading about stocism for a while now. Some books I really enjoyed and think I learned from, others not so much. But it has always been very hard for me to implement the ideas into my everyday life and practice them. Sometimes I could reach out to these ideas and they helped, sometimes they did not. But that's enough of the introduction.

So this might be a bit strange post but, I don't know how many of you experienced burnout. I mean sometimes I am not 100% sure I am experiencing it. I mean there is no PCR test for this.

I am trying to map some sort of rebuilding plan for myself which will include therapy, meditation and probably stoicism as I sympathize with the basic concepts, so I can come out of this stronger than before. However and here is the tricky part for me, currently I am not acting like a stoic. I have a job that I am leaving in \~2 months, I have some duties still that are very hard for me to do, it's like taking 4-5x extra effort to do the simplest things - compared to what it used to be - and at the end of the day I don't feel I am doing my best, because I feel I can't reach my best currently and this makes me frustrated and stressed.

Have any of you had gone through something similar, could stoicism help you? If so, did it help you while you were still in the same position, same work etc?"

1,"Nothing seems worthwhile and life seems just like a never ending battle that in the end you lose It's all just a bunch of tasks that need to be constantly done.  I try to implement stoicism, but due to my dyspraxia and ADD I forget tasks and spiral into a procrastination cycle. The first with fucking up my coordination, it also effects my organizational skills and short-term memory. The latter one is already known by everyone.

I have also physical pain due to kyphoscoliosis, skin issues and very bad teeth. 

To help my back I need to gain muscle, but I can't lift too much due to weak connective tissue. I can't swim public pools have too much chlorine and it fucks up my skin (it gets all red and it hurts, like some sort of burns).

I have an allergy and don't know to what. Raynaud's syndrome, your hands and feet are always cold, weak peripheral circulation. 

I listen to Stoics, every other day and try to implement it, but it all seems like cope. It's all for nothing, I am just supposed to be an automaton, be indifferent to my chronic conditions. I know I can't cure them, but living with them also seems like a bad idea from my perspective. I don't want to depend on others too much and I can't work a lot of jobs. Suicide seems like the answer, as the stoics said, the door is always opened. There is a grain in me that wants to live, it's the damn survival instinct, a product of the DNA delusion.

In my head a film is rolling with only one thing ""Death shall set you free!"".

I know you are going to say go to therapy, but for what?

To make me feel good about myself, that hardship will make me a better person. It's only made me more bitter and cynical. It's all a form of cope, if it works for you, fine. But it does not work for all of us."

1,"Stoicism for a Better Life - Weekly exercise (November 11) Hello there, 

For this week’s exercise, let us circle back to Seneca (It's been a while). This is from his moral letters to Luciluis, I 7.1:

&gt;""Do you ask me what you should regard as especially to be avoided? I say, crowds; for as yet you cannot trust yourself to them with safety.""  

You have two ears and one mouth, so the gods/logos/universe/nature must want you to listen twice more than you talk right? Well okay, that's not how evolution works, but the point remains valid. If we want to cultivate our relationships with other people, what do you think will be more conducive towards this goal: Lecturing or listening? How can you lecture if you don't listen first to understand the need, if any, of the listener? Any which way you look at it, listening (as opposed to lecturing) helps connect with people. So, as our ancient guides remind us, listen to your fellow human beings, don't perform for them. 

We like to think we are the main character in our own TV show and this is normal, for we are the center and main character of our own narrative from our own internal perspective. However, never forget that our narrative is one that exists in tangent with 7.6 billion other narratives. There are tons more of other points of view out there that are not your own egocentric view.

**So as a practical exercise this week, avoid making mention at great length and excessively of your own deeds, dangers, ideas or accomplishments in your conversations.** It is not as pleasant for others to hear about your adventures, as it is for you to call to mind your own dangers. Instead, **truly try and listen to what others are saying.** Don't just wait for them to finish what they are saying before you grab the first opportunity to jump in with your own stories and ideas.

If you feel comfortable, do share some of your stories. It may very well help inspire others. I wish you a tranquil and productive week.

One thing that I wanted to ask for more experienced and knowledgable stoics is how would Stoics respond to getting good grades in Highschool? I have really been stressed out recently 'cause I need good grades to get into the university I want.

So to make the question more concise, I would love to learn how Stoics would set their mindset when it comes to getting really good grades in Highschool (as that's the only part where I simply cannot keep my Stoic mindset and actions), and Stoics view on grades in general.

Thank you everybody :D"

1,"I woke up today! Momento Mori. I've studied stoicism for several years. I struggle on a daily basis to work my learnings into every day life. My emotions, desires, biases, and perceptions control me on a daily basis.

That being said, my two year old son gave me passionate reminder of 'momento mori.'

I was up early, doing some writing and drinking coffee. All in all a good morning.

I hear my son get out of bed. I check my phone... he is up a little early. I'm a little annoyed that my free time is cut short, but I wasn't enjoying what I was working on anyway.

Oliver, my son, walks around the corner. He shows know signs of sleep in his eyes, but his hair is sticking out in every direction. He still walks with the clumsiness of a toddler, but Oliver doesn't let that slow him down. He spreads his arms wide and beams a smile at me.

""I woke up today!"" he shouted, joy clinging to every word.

It was pure celebration. He was announcing it to the world. 

It was passionate to give me pause and stir my thoughts. I didn't know what to say. My tiny terror, my little man, had just embodied momento mori in such a pure, innocent way. What could I possibly say that would match his enthusiasm and profound insight? What could I say that would show him that my happiness matched his own?

""That is awesome!"" I said back, spreading my arms. We hugged, and I held him for as long as he would allow. 

You woke up today, and that is awesome."

1,"Masters &amp; Apprentices Life is a balancing act of many things, including leading and following. If one leads all their life, they may begin to see themselves as above all, and become arrogant. When one follows their entire life, they stay a child, desperately grasping for their mother's hand. All great leaders were also great followers. Also, if there's a lack of either of these, you're prone to two different kinds of immaturity. You can't lead without following the knowledge you're after, and followers without leaders are aimless wanderers.

When do we lead, and when do we follow? Act your part as you normally would, and you'll know when to take charge, and when to hone your skills.

You will die.

I am an extremely uptight and clean person, partly from preference and partly from upbringing. My roommate is not. Some examples of things he does that really bother me are that he does not clean silverware, dishes he does clean are never really clean, always drops sticky things on the counter and never wipes it down, as well as just spilling crumbs everywhere. It drives me crazy to see how hard I work at being disciplined in my cleaning routines just for him to have basically no respect for them. 

I recognize this is an external over which I have no control but it is quite hard for me to shake this one. A lot of externals I have been able to disregard but since this one is in my home it makes me very upset.

Were/are there Stoic writers who speak about community organization without a state? without money? ...Who don't worship hierarchies and obedience? ...Who view politics as a divisive plague? ...Who call out taxation as theft?

I plan to read some of the classics, as I'm sure there is much wisdom to be gleaned from their pages... but I appreciate any other recommendations that might fit my query as well! Thanks!"
1,"Some paradoxical ideas? Hello, I am relatively new to stoicism so please excuse any misunderstanding or ignorance on my part. I have read 'A Guide to the Good Life' and currently going through 'How to Think Like a Roman Emperor' so far. Having been through CBT processes before there are a lot of similarities that have made my introduction to Stoicism much easier.

Most of what I have heard/read so far makes a lot of sense and I plan to start practicing. However, there are a few areas where I am bit confused since there seems to be some conflicting advice. On one hand there is advice to look at 'things' objectively (e.g. "" this fine wine is just fermented grapes""), and assessing pleasures for their long term pros and cons compared to pursuing virtues. On the other hand there is advice to employ practices like negative visualisation so that you can enjoy/ appreciate the 'things' you have more.

These leave me a bit confused how I am supposed to be thinking about, say, watching a movie for example. Whilst watching it should I be like 'this is just a box of electronics and changing lights' or ask myself 'would I miss this if my TV was taken from me', or should I just enjoy it fully because I recognise I may not always have it. Just seems like mixed signals of 'Enjoy things as much as possible by appreciating they are temporary and reminding yourself of that, but realise they are nothing to be enjoyed because they are only XYZ and don't improve your virtue.'

Would appreciate any thoughts or help in reconciling these."

Do you remember how mediocre I was? Disorientated, I even held a grudge against Nature. Good people opened their doors to me, I made no effort to enter: We had sworn to be proud and worthy. 

Then I realised the futility of my ways, for it is once you choke that you realise that they are in pain too. The absurdity of the life we live, I had to focus, accept my condition and move in the right direction.

There was a lot of borrowing and overlap among the philosophers. That’s because real philosophers weren’t concerned with authorship, only what worked.

1,"I want to move past feelings of resentment towards my parents. First off, I recognize that I'm fortunate to have grown up in a middle class family in a first world country. My parents are still together, and have always been present in my life. But I still can't get past this feeling of resentment I carry with me. I'll break it down into the following:

* Lack of social skills - School years were filled with anxiety, awkwardness, low self-confidence, and lack of social awareness. I had a crippling fear of public speaking. I was a late bloomer on the dating scene, and it took many years of trial and error to get comfortable with it. I cringe hard at it all. The anxiety has lead to long term health issues, particularly with my stomach.
* Lack of practical skills - Cooking, cleaning, maintenance, home improvement, finance, networking, job interviews, how to dress well, hygiene, how to shave. I've been slowly been picking up these skills as I've gotten older. 
* Lack of a family bond - I'm probably closest to my mom. My dad was always somewhere in the background, and I don't feel like I could open up to him about anything. I always had to ask him to do the typical father/son stuff with me. My sisters and I wanted nothing to do with each other growing up, but we're better now. I'd get in frequent arguments with my mom, and she would often guilt me for not starting conversations with my dad, uncle, or grandfather, even though THEY were the adults and I was the kid. I hardly remember any bonding time with any of them.
* Location - This is the one I feel most silly about. But early on we were in a vibrant fun city with lots to explore and experience. Then we moved across the country to a more isolated small town with very little to do. I look back and feel like a lot of my potential was lost with that move. But my dad moved for his career, and I feel like it's unfair to dwell on this too much.

I'm in the middle chapter of my life now, and when I have kids, I'd like to pass on as much knowledge, skills, experiences, and encouragement as I possibly can. I want them to thrive, not just exist. I never really got that feeling from my parents. I feel like I couldn't ask them for advice, and I had to teach myself everything. Of course, I have no real way of knowing what they were feeling or going through when they were raising us. My parents are getting older now, and I basically just want to move forward and enjoy my time with them. I'm fully independent now, and they call every week or two which is nice, but really it's just the same conversation every time.

I realize this is pretty long-winded and I should bring it up in therapy or something, but I've found some comfort in stoic philosophy in recent years. I was wondering if there were any good resources, teachings, or personal thoughts that deal with this sort of topic? It's very much appreciated."
1,"This too shall pass Maybe not exactly a Stoic principle, but more of a personal take on Stoic philosophy:

I had a moment today when I thought about how much my life has changed in just 5 years. Five years ago I remember being really worked up about what some coworker thought of me, or worrying about if the gym I liked was going to close. Now I don't even live in the same town as that gym (which did eventually close) and I don't work with that coworker anymore, and in fact, I have no idea where they live what they're doing. I was also really upset at the time about an ex who I felt had wronged me – now I never even think about this person anymore!

All of these things were at one point Big Important Problems that I had to *analyze* to death to find a solution.

But you know what? In every single case, the ""problem"" was  solved by just moving on. I moved on to another company. Moved on to another girlfriend. Found a new gym. My Big Important Problems never got ""solved"", they just sort of... faded away. They became irrelevant due to changing circumstances.

It's a comforting thought. Make a list of your Big Important Problems today and do this exercise looking five years into the past. Reading old journals can be enlightening too. It's a reminder that 99% of our concerns are unimportant circumstantial stuff. Stated in other terms: ""this too shall pass."""

1,"Stoicism in V for Vendetta Hello, I've studied stoicism for a while, and I'm currently working on a project wherein I analyze a film and draw points between the story and/or characters for certain philosophical and ethical points. It usually helps me to discuss such ideas and try to broaden my view on subjects before I make my own assumptions and observations. I'm drawing reference from the movie, not the graphic novel. Any weigh-ins are appreciated and will greatly serve me. Thank you in advance and I look forward to speaking with you."

1,"How do you manage to practice around your relationships that have different views than what stoicism teaches? Family, friends and partners sometimes have different views than you and sometimes are completely unaware of stoic philosophy in general, how do you manage to practice in living you life around them. For example whenever there's a big issue about anything I'm able to keep more of calm head and think rationally where as my father would instantly hop on the worst and ponder on this impending doom for several weeks. The idea of explaining stoicism and it's concepts to my fearful 65 year old dad seems really odd and I don't know why."
1,"Can someone please explain to me how stoicism relates to dissatisfaction? I read Mark Mansons , "" The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*\*\*"" and I feel that it compliments Stoicism. Part of the book talks about two different ways to not give a F\*\*\*: 1.) I don't give a F\*\*\* so im just going to come to terms with whatever is bother me &amp; 2.) I don't give a F\*\*\* so im going to make that problem my b\*\*\*\* and conquer it. 

How does stoicism fit into this mind set? I have this impression that if you are dissatisfied with something and you can't come to terms with what ever you are dissatisfied with, you should pursue a better life. 

Below are some ideas that I have:

* Always strive to be better but to appreciate what you have
* Go about pursuing a better life without anger and worry
* Pursue a better life because you truly want to from one's own ideas, not because of something external."
1,"What is the stoic's approach to stress and anxiety? Hi all,

Over the past year, I have been learning about STOIC principles. I'm aware that adopting the various aspects of stoicism is a life-long journey. 

One aspect of my life that I tend not to apply it to, is my current situation. I work a full-time job and am doing a part-time MBA program at night. 

Recently, i have started to feel incredibly anxious and stressed about it all. Not only wanting to ensure I do well in my course, but also the stress of neglecting those around me. I feel like i do not currently have a balance between the work, school and personal life which is not very healthy. When I do hang out with friends are or my partner, i cant stop thinking about all the difficult things i have to learn for my course which gives me more anxiety. It doesnt feel nice not being present and having quality time with the people i love. 

What would a stoics take be on stress and anxiety?"
1,"So my dog just got put down Some backstory:
She had always been on the skinny side, however lately we noticed she was losing quite a bit of weight. She also had trouble walking up stairs and in general just very unstable on her feet, so we went to get her checked at the vet earlier today, figuring it was just some minor issues related to her sterilization a couple weeks prior. They ran a blood test and found that her kidneys were looking really bad, and told us they would need to run some more tests tomorrow. We then take her home and wait for tomorrow. A couple hours goes by and she starts shaking and wheezing. We immediately rush her to an animal hospital and get her hospitalized, and was told that the doctor would run some tests and give us an update in a couple of hours.

Fast forward to the present and we just got the news that it would be best for her to sleep in. I was shocked and sad at first but quickly realized that this was an ideal opportunity to practice stoicism.

I understand that death is a part of life, and it is one of the many things that are out of our control, yet somehow I was still somewhat in control of her death, and that’s what really gets to me. The fact that I had to make such a choice although I had hoped to share many more years of joy with her.

I guess what really hurt the most was my expectations and how sudden this all was. It hadn’t even crossed my mind that something like this could happen when we got her. We even checked with multiple doctors regularly about her weight to make sure nothing was wrong, and to suddenly go from happy and healthy to acute kidney failure in under a week really shocked me.

Not sure what my goal is in sharing this. I suppose it’s a way of coping. Take what you will from it.

Stay stoic"

1,"Watching sports as a Stoic So I thought I'd write this after a particularly bad weekend for my favorite sports teams. Let me begin by saying that I've played sports all my life, from baseball and cross country in my youth to now continuing to compete in marathons, BJJ, and Muay Thai as a grown adult. But I feel like there's a lot that's been written from the athletes perspective and not much from the fans so today I'd like to explore it here. 

I'm a big sports fan I watch pretty much everything and I get invested heavily in my favorite teams and fighters so when they lose I'd take pretty hard. A few years back when my favorite football team(American football) was doing surprisingly well I got so heavily invested that if they won on Sunday the rest of the week I was in an incredibly pleasant mood but if they lost the whole week I felt like I just watched my dog get shot. Since then I've matured more and I've started my journey down the Stoic path and I've found sports are a great way to practice Stoicism. 

I still get heavily invested when I'm watching a game/fight, it wouldn't be fun if I didn't. However when they win or lose I allow myself to feel the emotion of the game for just brief moment before I let it go. I don't spend time thinking ""man if the player had just gotten that interception"" or ""if he would've just made that field goal"" because that serve no purpose. As much as I'd like to believe that I have an effect on the outcome of the game the truth is I don't. I think being a sports fan is a great way to learn and teach life lessons in a way that ultimately doesn't harm us as fans in any way. 

I don't have children yet but when I do I hope they'll sit down to watch the ball game with me so when our favorite team wins I can remind them ""Fortune smiled upon us today, but don't forget you still need to finish your homework before bed"" and if they lose I can remind them that ""Accept this loss and don't dwell on it, don't spend time thinking of what could have been"". 

I understand that a big part of stoicism is self control over expectations but I believe it can be a great exercise to let yourself get caught up in the emotion of the game if it means that when it's over you can now practice regaining control and practice letting go of the emotion, good or bad. Movies and Television in general can probably be used in a similar way but the randomness of sports lends it's self better to this sort of thing in my opinion. 

Anyways, I don't know if something similar has been posted before I'm sorry if this is redundant. If you guys also watch sports what are some painful losses you experienced? For me the most painful loss I've watched in recent memory was the Arizona Cardinals losing to the Panthers in the NFC championship a few years ago and just this Saturday ASU blowing a 14 point lead in the last two minutes of the game. I've handled the loss this Saturday much better than I did AZ Cardinals loss and it's what inspired me to write this up."

I’ve had mental health issues for years that have impacted my relationships, friendships, habits, academics, etc. I’ve been going to therapy and taking medications for years as well. However, I have not been mentally proactive as I should be. My main issues are: feeling like I’m not good enough, competing against others in a toxic way, believing things that are not true, laziness, self-flagellation, taking my emotions out on others. In other words, I need help managing my feelings, especially when an undesirable event has recently occurred. I’ve come here because from what I’ve read, stoicism is the practice of not being overwhelmed with emotions and controlling them properly. What would you suggest I do? What are some books that I should start reading? Thank you for taking the time to read this."
1,"A small recommendation for french people Bonjour! Hi!

I'm a french canadian student in philosophy and am an avid reader!  I've been dipped in the philosophy potion being 4 yo as my grand-father is/was a philosopher!  He was a college teacher in philosophy by the past and is now a big book store owner in Quebec/Canada!  Because of that background I've read a tremendous amount of book for somebody my age (20) and have met several ways of thinking throughout these reading!  

I'm here to recommend not only about stoïcism reading but general philosophy reading since I think that stoic ways are a thing that is tremendously helpfull but cannot be without other ways of thinking, making your life yours.  I stongly believe that stoïcism is a way of being but it cannot be on it's own, it needs help of other philosophy to be since it's a completed incoplete way of being if you can grasp what I mean.  So here are just a couple of books I stongly recommend to read for neophytes (100-200pages), andvanced readers (200-350 pages) as much as heavy lifters of books(350 pages+).

Neophytes:
""The way of the bow"" : Paulo Cohelo (en)
""The Alchemist"" : Paulo Cohelo (en)
""Le miracle spinoza"" : Fréderic Lenoir (fr-?en?)

Advanced
""Ishmael: l'Homme une fois disparu, y aura-t-il un espoir pour le gorille?"" : Frederic Lenoir (fr-?en?)
""The fifth moutain"" : Paulo Cohelo (fr-en)

Heavy weight
""Cosmos"" : Michel Onfray (fr)
""Sagesse"" : Michel Onfray (fr)


 I don't know if there's a lot of other french here but consuder reading as a proper way of learning guys, don't be shy to buy a book, higghlight it and write in it as further in your life it will make you able to retrospect on your past self and see where you came from and where you are going.  It makes you also more aware of your reading and of what goes through your mind wich can be transposed to other moments in your life not only reading!  Also it's a beautifull ""heritage"" (things you leave to your family once you die I'm missing a word in my vocabulary here please excuse me). 

So that's about what I had to say, I hope you can enjoy something in here and if you need more reading recomandation, feel free to hit me up, dm me or ask in comments for theme or other ways of philosophy!  Or you can also enlighten me with some of your own reading discovery!

Merci!"
1,"Is this an example of stoicism even though I get frustrated at times? Hi there, I have been reading up on stoicism and trying to practice stoicism for a few years now.  I wanted to know if not retaliating towards someone is considered stoic behavior.  A few months back, I recorded on video my neighbor keying my car.  I don't even talk to this person or why she did it.  I called the cops and to make a long story short, the case is still pending with the county prosecutor.  I get frustrated and confused every time I think about it and when I see this person.  I also get frustrated at why the case is still pending.  

My thought process is that I did everything I could with the authorities and it's only so many dollars in damage and retaliating is not stoicism and would only fuel more anger in me.  Also, I need to be patient with the system and can't do anything to speed things up.  I try to be as calm as possible in regard to this incident, but it's challenging at times.  Your input is appreciated.  Thanks."

1,"Positive thinking Positive thinking is the art of having happy, pleasing thoughts: as if it will breed happiness. It is the neglect of one’s emotions. It is also ignoring adversity. As if anything that shall happen should necessarily be a good thing. 

Negative thinking is the art of having sad, unpleasing thoughts. As if anything that shall happen should necessarily be a bad thing. 

Positive thinking promises that nothing non-preferred will happen. Negative thinking promises that nothing preferable will happen. 

Instead, we should aim to think rationally. Anticipate adversity to the end that you may foresee what could occur. Then, return to the present. Not “dwelling” but “anticipating” the near future. 

See things for what they are. Expect that anything can happen; preferable or not, but lies outside the sphere of choice. None are neither good or bad, but indifferent. Externals cannot harm you. The only good is moral behaviour. The only bad is immoral behaviour. 

Positive thinking is no good choice, and certainly not what a stoic practices. I believe I have a good understanding of positive thinking and why it should not be practiced but inform me if I made any error or something key that could have been mentioned (:"
1,"To uphold a stoic mindset is most important during the good times So Ive been learning and implementing stoic teachings in my life for the past year now. The reason I got interested in stoicism was because I was having a tough time. I was going through a deep depression, my first breakup, moving away to university and then lockdown happened. Through all this I slowly put myself back together through different philosophies, and stoicism was one of the most helpful.

But I think back to times in my life when times were better. I spent these times living hedonistically in every which way, using substances, binge eating, always socialising etc. Now i realise it wouldve been far better to practice stoicism during these times because when the difficult times came along i would have been better prepared.

Now thats not to say i regret my past. I dont dwell too much on it but i want to use it as reference for when things get easier down the road. I want to upkeep my stoic readings and thoughts during the easier times to avoid becoming complacent and to prepare for the future."
1,"My experience with the law of reversed effort (Part 3) Part 1: [https://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/jlhup6 my\_experience\_with\_the\_law\_of\_reversed\_effort/](https://www.reddit.com/r/taoism/comments/jlhup6/my_experience_with_the_law_of_reversed_effort/)

Part 2: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/j9p780/a\_blessing\_in\_disguise\_seneca/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/j9p780/a_blessing_in_disguise_seneca/)

I deleted the account I posted the parts above with but I am back.

I post this because I myself tend forget about how imortant the law of reversed effort is.

As a reminder, the law of reversed effort is this: the harder you try, the worse you do. Or as Alan Watts puts it : *""When you try to stay on the surface of the water, you sink; but when you try to sink you float.""*

Why do I post this? 

First, I have had great success in unknowingly using the law of reversed effort in the past. It literally changed my life at a crucial moment that defined my path.

Secondly, I got very agitated during this weekend. It lead me to delete my SoundCloud account as well as my YouTube channel. I started feeling like my music was worthless and that nobody cared. All that is left from 10 years of music is this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N44hrDe2ytM) that I did with a friend of mine posted today. 

Thirdly, online classes stress me out. I can't follow them. I also have a hard time listening to the teacher and understanding the slides at the same time.

**So I did some thinking.** I realize that at the end of the day, all I need is 50% to pass. I unconciously felt like if I didn't get 100% I would be a failure which is not the case at all. At this point, I am one month away from graduating and it all doesn't matter much anymore so I'll do as I did before: aim to be average even if it sounds counterintuitive. I don't quite know what to think about music though. 

It's interesting because there are very motivational people out there such as David Goggins. I do follow them from time to time but I end up being stressed out and don't get as much done and as well as when I'm following the law of reversed effort. So whenever you feel stressed out, agitated, things don't quite work out, don't forget about the law of reversed effort.

Thank you for reading."

1,"Dealing with a confrontational roommate Long story short, I've been dealing with a roommate who has it out for me for no reason, other then that he's an asshole. We used to get along well but he overstepped his his bounds, in which he thought he was a surrogate parent to me and felt like he could basically tell me what to do. I have dealt with that situation and since then we just don't talk to each other, or rather, he just doesn't acknowledge me anymore. I find it silly since he's a few decades older than me. Its as if all the bonding we had over the past 6 or so months means nothing and he's lost all respect he had for me, all because he was out of line and thought he was my father or something.

He now slams doors and stopped any curiosity he once did in regards to being a respectful roommate. He's a very confrontational individual who, for example, if asked how he's doing by a Walmart door greeter, will respond with, ""thats a personal fucking question"". I can put up with a lot of bullshit, probably too much since I absolutely hate confrontation. For the most part I can remain stoic and project the appearance of a calm demener but these situations really just stress me out. The tension thats created raises my anxiety levels, so I mostly choose to avoid it at all costs. I'm never in our room anymore unless he's gone and when I'm there there's always this anxiety about what if he comes back and I'm forced to be in his presence for just a second, still I can put up with it. Its gotten worse though. I accidentally coughed while half asleep at 2 am and he gets up, walks up to my bed, leans into my face and calls me an asshole and to cover my mouth. Im like uhh ok. Totally unnecessary. Tonight he gets up in my face about the curfew here, which I have an exemption from that I calmly explained to him. Hes like we'll see about that, think your slick huh, you messed with the wrong guy. Im like how am I messing with you? Doesn't answer and repeats himself then stomps off. 

Im tired of this undeserved hostility. Im a quiet, clean, respectful tennet here and his behavior is totally unwarranted. I have a really good relationship with the house manager and right now I feel confident that I can convince him to kick out this asshole. I refuse to be the one to move out and let him win, stupid pride I know. But in case nothing changes, I'd like to learn if this community has any techniques to reduce the stress from confrontations so to regulate emotions and think more logically, or if there's ways to better conduct oneself in these types of situations."

2. Videos or talks that go in depth into stoic concepts. 

3. Daily materials. 

4. Rescues for specific emotions. Feeling angry? Feeling sad? There's a talk/lecture for that.

5. Situational rescues: lost a job? Dealing with existentialism? There's a talk for that.

1,"When is it time to die? Seneca writes in Letter 102: “We must cast off the lust for life and learn that it makes no difference when you suffer what must be suffered at some time or other; what matters is how well you live, not how long; indeed, living well often depends on not living long.”

While I agree and understand the point that life in itself isn’t good, I’m confused by his refutation of people who desire to live in bad experiences (earlier in the letter he derides the man who would live on top of a pike). If virtue is the only good, then wouldn’t we desire to continue to live in any circumstance because we can continue to be virtuous in any circumstance?"
1,"Are you stoic about others not being stoic? All my life, I've had problems with being angry or depressed. Other people have not been tolerant of it. They would get angry at me for being angry, which obviously did not make things better. How dare I have the nerve to not be happy. Similarly, if I was depressed, nobody ever taught me to accept it. \\They'd either coddle me by arguing against the negative emotion or blame it on some mental disorder.

I think people need to start learning to act more like therapists. Being intolerant of others' negative emotions is just as bad, if not worse, than being intolerant of your own.

How do you respond to people who are obnoxiously whiny about minor inconveniences? Do you ever get angry at them for ""ruining the mood"" for yourself or others?"
1,"Appreciation and Gratitude stoicism says to appreciate what you have and want nothing. I find this very hard to do. Here’s something I wrote in my notes last night thinking about it. Any thoughts on it are welcomed.

how do I appreciate all that I am and all that I have when my whole purpose is to progress in life? when I learn about and appreciate what I am I see the potential for more, the capacity to do special things and be remembered a little longer for something. I see in myself attributes and qualities that cannot be taught or bought, so I get the urge to use them for all their worth. after all, we’re all here to live and die, what better to spend my time on than this purpose of accomplishing goals and achieving greatness? the ultimate purpose of it all. what else really matters? how do I feel content with what I have, when I’m alive to be rid of it in place for something better? how would I be content without directly affecting my progress towards my goals in way of laziness?"
1,"Any idea why I [23F] am addicted to wallowing and ruminating and how to get out of it? 
I have become so used to my negative emotions, which I’ve had for so long, that I now have a very high tolerance for them. This has decreased my motivation to change.

Moreover, I’m starting to almost enjoy beating myself up mentally. Sometimes it almost feels like I’m m purposely inducing these “negative” states in myself. I think this is partially because the idea of not being self-aware of my faults terrifies me and I never want to forget them so that if/when someone else points them out it won’t be a surprise to me. But the other maybe larger part is that I’m becoming addicted to the emotional intensity, and negative emotions are as good as positive ones in satisfying that craving. 

This isn’t an excuse, and I know I’m capable of changing, but I’m finding it difficult mostly because I don’t really want to stop. But part of me does. The main reason I want to stop is for the sake of others around me, and for the sake of other people’s perception of me. I find myself constantly trying to understand how this behavior might come across to others and I do realize how annoying and draining it is. I do not want to be seen that way. 

Any advice or insight or similar experiences?"

1,"Requesting thought from stoics Hi, I am 22 years old. I spend most of my time working (sales), roughly 10 hours a weekday and 2-4 on weekend days. I genuinely enjoy the time I commit to my craft. Most of my peers live very different lives than I do; I’ve found it’s hard to develop or maintain social relationships. I lease a house in a suburban area that consists of parents or their children my age that prioritize school work and late night socialization. 

Now, I am a diligent stoic. I unconsciously recite its wisdom. On a weekly basis, I find 1 or 2 nights I am free after work and the gym, sitting in my living room wishing for more. It leads to a spiral of negative thoughts relating to loneliness. It’s this feeling of discontentment that can only be filled by deep meditative focus, or weed and sex. In my case, loneliness is a result of desire; my mind consistently wanders to wishing a woman was with me. I’ve yet to decipher if it’s lust or a desire to start a family. 

On those 1 or 2 nights, I try to meditate in order to overcome those negative thoughts. I find myself failing more often than I’d like. The plan is to just continue my night as usual by accomplishing small goals until I’m tired enough to sleep. 

I guess my reasoning for posting this is to ask other stoics how you fill time that you aren’t doing things like work, organizing, cleaning, eating, working out, reading, etc. I would assume with social relationships, but I find no comfort in relationships other than with lovers. I know that is not “normal” but I’ve yet to find a way to properly align my thoughts."

1,"Should you debate friends about conspiracies? I feel that conspiracy theories are one of the most damaging things on the planet right now. The spread of disinformation is tearing us apart everywhere I look.

Some of my friends and family believe in deeply bizarre conspiracies. I’ve tried to debate them in a friendly manner but I never seem to make much progress with the argument. There’s always another conspiracy that can back up the one we’re talking about. It’s time consuming and mentally draining.

Sometimes I think the stoic thing to do is just to ignore it and focus on myself but that’s what I was doing before and when I turned back around everyone was saying insane things. I fear that if everybody just shrugged and said “hmm I guess my friends and family are crazy now. Nothing I can do,” if we wasn’t looking out for our friends and having these long conversations, disinformation would spread much faster.

What’s the right thing to do?"
1,"Are we obliged to stay with a person that has an illness? Would it be Stoic if we leave our partners for that? I'm curious what the Stoic community thinks about this question.

This is pretty broad and can be seen from different perspectives. An interesting variable includes the type of illness and the stage of it. Examples include depression, suicidal thoughts, bipolar disorder, eating disorder, terminal cancer, reproductive problems, etc...

What would you base your answers on? If these problems are not caused by us or the person we are dating or married to, then how should we react to it? Would you base your answers on love, virtues, self-interest, or something else?

I personally think there is a fine line that when a Stoic should stay in the relationship. As a human being, we have our limits; as a Stoic, we have a mindset to do our best and perhaps surpass that limit. But there should be a time when we should not have the obligation to be with someone that has an illness. If the person is physically threatening us or anyone we know, I think that would be a red signal.  If he/she/them start to fall into vices and influence us to do the same, then that is a signal to leave. No matter how terrible the illness is, as long as it does not affect my virtues and character, then I think it is worth to stay and help them out as much as I can. I would not worry if it cuts off all of my preferred indifferences, but as long as I remain virtuous in a relationship that includes an illness, then I am there to stay.

That is my view about this topic at this moment, but I would like to receive the insights of my fellow Stoics from this subreddit. Feel free to add other elements I may have not mentioned."
1,"Lost in what to follow for principles in life. Hello to you all,

I am having a real  dilemma in life and trying to priorities my life since now I am going to be a father soon. I have been raised as a buddhist for a number of years before I lost interest in it thinking that the philosophy is only about ""me"" and not about ""us"". Since then, I have been following books such as Think and Grow Rich, Awaken the Giant Within and many of these so called ""American"" books and the Law of Attraction and all that kind of stuff. It has helped me in life so far but now I feel like since I have been reading stoic books, I have felt very conflicted with all the self-help/improvement genre. I find that self-help is so much BS compared to stoic books. I find that when I practiced stocism, I felt so much at ease about life and in a way enjoying life more. However, I want to achieve big things in life and feel like that is where stoicism doesn't recognise about achieving financial freedom, travelling the world and more. Since I am going to be a father soon, I really need to priorities my life and philosophy. Do I choose stoicism and life a tranquile life or do I follow these crazy self-help American books that basically tell you that you are never perfect and should work on your life. It seems like recently I have been having an internal battle in my mind. I am lost....  


It may not be so clear what I have explained but it is my rambling from my heart.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Ah man life sucks, this doesn't seem worth it. Even if I max out my performance at work/relationships/studies, the rewards seem meager 

\- Well they do seem meager, but there are still a few things I want to do/see in life so I need to hold out mentally so I can perform well in studies/work/interactions 

\- But it sucks, the rewards don't seem worth it 

\- Yeah but I'm still curious how things will play out if I max out my performance at certain things, maybe things will get better 

\- Maybe, but good chance it won't, plus things suck

\-It does suck. But shit, how else am I going to experience certain things I'm curious about unless I hold out longer and try to max out my performance 

\- Those things are probably not worth the effort, won't be a magic rainbow at the end, chasing things that won't solve your problems

\- Probably not tbh but if I tried to kill myself, then probably my curiosity to find certain things out would stop me and fuck off because I am trying to max out my performance and need all my soldiers in line

And on and on this thought loop goes. I wonder if this phenomenon has a name and if there are good methods developed to stop this kind of thought loop. Doubtless other people have thought encountered it in the wild.

I realize that Stoicism includes only the internal world. Someone else doing something is entirely separate of that world. However, the feelings brought on by a close attachment being severed are an internal issue.

I also realise that my control likes only within myself, then, I am responsible for how I respond to situations. But I still struggle.

I am 18. I live with my mother, stepdad, two brothers (13, 2) and two sisters (16). My other sister is a baby. The baby cries nearly all day, my toddler brother is often noisy. My stepdad likes to blast loud rock music in the house and for some reason starts making meals at midnight. In a noisy fashion. I have never thought to tell him if he could be quieter because I know he wouldn’t like that. If I talk to anybody about noise levels I’ll be rejected. Also, the door neighbour there to have parties - more than usual lately. My room sits right next to their backyard - only a 2.5 meter space. 

You might be thinking why don’t I just move out? It’s really rare that people move or at 18 where I’m from. An 18 year old couldn’t possibly afford to rent or buy unless they’re rich and also confident that they can manage. 

I also have minor Autism, which, doesn’t help. People with autism tend to be more sensitive to noise. I get out the house whenever I can but not always can I escape. Of course there’s nothing I can do about it and this event tests me of my ability to endure. Still, is there any further advice which may benefit?"

1,"Just started journaling Hi! 

I bought the daily stoic book with the 366 stoic meditations by Ryan Holiday. Along with it I’m reading another stoic book (my 3rd one).

The book encourages journaling and I started to do it using a software called obsidian with daily notes. I write the phrase of the day, my interpretation and analysis of the history Ryan gives, a morning and night reflections where I try to see how today’s meditation and history can change how I see the world and how I see myself in it with my experiences of the day.

Reflecting and thinking this way has proven to be highly beneficial, and I have just started it. The first day was really simple, but the more you do it, the more complex it becomes and you develop your own system. Your mind will take you to a lot of places and you will connect a lot of the dots with others areas of your life. You will connect stoicism to places you forgot needed to be addressed.

I want to recommend you to start journaling so you can put yourself, your actions, beliefs and thoughts on paper or whatever you use to write, and start attacking all this things with this philosophy. It’s like with journaling you are a sculptor of your mind and you are sculpting a better version of yourself everyday.

Since getting into stoicism and philosophy (not fanatically, reading meditations slowly and recently picked up journaling) a few years back the strength these myths gave me finally got a name and even more history.

Ive always thought back to Hercules when facing a hurdle in live and now I can relate these myths to stoic principles.

1,"Hey guys, I’m in bit of a dilemma and I was wondering if you could help me out. So I’m completely aware what stoic philosophers have to say about anger: a passion that must be avoided at all costs.

Now, even speaking from a rational perspective, that would make sense because anger stops us from thinking and behaving positively. I also believe that.

So what is the dilemma here?

Well, here’s the thing, I have always hated people who hurt and discriminate people weaker than them: Wife-beaters, bullies and asshole bosses. 

Just the other day, one of my female friends was assaulted by her boyfriend so badly that she was in tears and I could see a big scar on her face. I’m not kidding, I was enraged for the whole day, my entire day was spent just wanting to go to her boyfriends house and giving him a taste of his own medicine.

My blood literally boils every time I hear or see such an incident and I wanna go berserk on the oppressor. It doesn’t matter if it’s a stranger or not.

Besides, why shouldn’t I feel anger at them? Do I just act calm and pretend that nothing happened? It’s almost impossible.

If I stop feeling anger at that, I would eventually also stop feeling sympathy for the oppressed and a strong desire for justice against oppressors.

So on one hand, I think anger is bad and on the other hand, I think it’s totally justified.

Sometimes, though, I just don't understand entire passages. Yesterday, I didn't understand a passage and curiously I become loving it when I saw someone in this r/Stoicism talk about it and explain it. I then became mad about it.

What's my non-ending question then? What should I do? Should I skip it and then hope I get that point in another book or so? Should I do my best of efforts to understand(knowing that sometimes is probably repeated idea)?

1,"No clue about anything in my life, complete lack of direction/understanding Hey everyone, thought it was about time I made this post in search of help. I'm 19 and currently living at home while in community college because of my depression (dysthymia) and anxiety, as well as ADHD, which I've all had for 4+ish years. I've seen multiple therapists, but none have seemed to help at all. Also taking medicine. Right now, I'm taking 7 course hours at my CC this semester, which I don't even know if college is what I want.

 I have no idea what I want in life, in regards to literally any decision or anything whatsoever. Long-term and short-term. The times I do want something or a goal, such as finding a specific college major or career (or even choosing a book or researching a topic), the idea lasts about 5 minutes before either: being burnt out or switching to something else. When I rarely do feel like doing anything, such as reading, I can't even decide a book to read and spend so much time deciding that I lose interest and become exhausted; or, in the few times I'm motivated, like cleaning my room, it's 1am and I'm too exhausted to do it. I know many people suggest going step-by-step towardz achieving things, but I don't know how if I don't know what the end goal is or even what I want. I feel completely stuck and slowly going insane. 

My mind is constantly moving and becomes exhausting. Don't know if this has happened with other people as well, but I feel like I've also noticed a decline in cognitive abilities and memory as well. Everything feels mushed together/foggy, like trying to remember days or thoughts. All I feel is 'numbness"".

All in all, I'm completely lost about every. single. thing. I can't remember the last time I was genuinely happy, motivated, driven, etc. I guess you can say I am reaching/have reached my tipping point, which I guess is a good thing because it drives change. Thanks for reading."

1,"I delivered a wedding ceremony for the first time with help from this sub. I'm 22 year old male, not very religious, and generally a chill, laid back extrovert. Since we're in a time of COVID, my older cousin asked me to become legally ordained and and marry him and his fiancé. We had a small wedding, maybe 13 or 14 witnesses, alongside two groomsman and three bridesmaids. Here's how I used stoicism to do it:

For starters, the whole wedding was sorta last minute, as I only had one month to prepare. I decided to do it because I prided myself in my public speaking skills, I could save my cousin a good chunk of money, and I could also add an personal touch to the ceremony that a minister wouldn't necessarily have, as I know my cousin and his fiancé much better than they theoretically would. I knew that I would have to deliver a level of emotion that many family members on both sides of the aisle built up in the 6 year relationship the bride and groom maintained. 

Instead of giving in to COVID fears, I went and got tested before we attended, as did my family members. All came back negative. I asked my cousin to ask his fianće's family to get tested, or quarantine accordingly before the wedding, so as to not create a superspreader event. Some tested, some didn't. I did my best to make sure we were safe, and I let out a sigh of relief a few days ago when I tested negative once more. I was able to calm my nerves by planning ahead of time. 

The church that I got ordained with online had sent me a script of what to say, however there was no real explanation on where to pause for effect or emphasize certain phrases. So, for every night for a month, I re-wrote the script in a handheld notebook which I was preparing to read from on the day of the event. I was formerly in band throughout high school and took an advanced theater class in college, so with that knowledge, I was able to write down certain articulations in the script using symbols I learned in band, and got into character before the wedding using the techniques I learned in theater. I was giving a performance, after all.

My cousin also asked me to say something about his father who had passed away three years ago. Clearly, it was a highly emotional event for him, and I was faced with an even bigger duty. However, instead of being overwhelmed with the task of speaking on behalf of a loved one who we wished could have been there, I did some emotional planning. 

I spent long nights thinking about my uncle, and what he meant to my cousin. One night, I casually asked his brother over some video games about what they used to do together as father and son, secretly taking notes on my phone while he was telling me about it. I wanted to paint a picture for the audience of what this man was like. As I was doing homework one night, I was thinking about my days in high school and then... BOOM it hit me. I remember that I sat next to my uncle at my cousin's high school graduation. If there were an image I needed to plant in the minds of my audience, it would be that of an extremely proud father watching his firstborn wave to him as he walked by in his cap and gown. I was happy and sad at this nostalgic memory, and I even let myself cry before writing it down in my forward to the script. 

I was preparing myself in that month by listening to music, playing epic video games, and watching the episode of Friends where Joey weds Monica and Chandler. I read my notebook while I was eating breakfast and before I went to bed. I spent a lot basically becoming numb to the emotional 25-minute speech I was preparing to give. When the day came, everybody was anxious but me. I knew what I had to do, and how to do it.... the only time I let myself get taken back was when the music started and I got to see my cousin's fiancé walk down the aisle with her father. I wiped a tear away, a gave the best public speech of my life so far. 

I started off talking about my cousin's father to hit everybody in the feels right away. At the end of that remembrance, I lowered my book and stressed how much my uncle would have loved to see this ceremony. After a quick comic relief, I cracked a smile on everybody's faces and began the wedding. I had read the script over a hundred times, easily... I'll tell you this about that experience: it is such a powerful sight when you look around and realize that you made 20 people ball their eyes out at the emotional rollercoaster that YOU delivered. 

I pronounced them husband and wife, slammed the book shut and directed the attention straight to my cousin and his new wife, so as to hand the applause of my performance straight to them. It was an amazing feeling, and even though I stayed humble when I was being praised afterwards, I can honestly say I'm very proud of myself for stoically holding it together long enough to make an amazing memory for everybody. 

I also got VERY drunk afterwards because I was emotionally drained! But it was a fun time, and I can sleep happily knowing I did that. 

Thank you for reading :)"

1,"Would you like to know what the actual difference between yourself and the gods will be? They will exist for longer. “And yet to me what an indisputable mark it is of a great artist to have captured everything in a tiny compass; a wise man has as much scope before him as a God with all eternity in front of him. There is one thing, too, in which the wise man actually surpasses any God: a God has nature to think for his immunity from fear, while the wise man can thank his own efforts for this. Look at that for an achievement, to have all the frailty of a human being and all the freedom from care of a God. Philosophy’s power to blunt all the blows of circumstance is beyond belief. Never a missile lodges in her; she has strong, impenetrable defenses; some blows she breaks the force of, parrying them with the slack of her gown as if they were trivial, others she flings off and hurls back at the sender.”

—Seneca, Letters from a Stoic, Letter 53, translated by Robin Campbell"
1,what do you think are some aspects of stoicism that will help deeper my understanding of epicureanism? as they are more alike than they are different 
1,"Something Buddhists and Stoics can agree on, it is what you make it. "
1,"Don’t think that your life is met with misfortune that surpasses the lives of others. Fortune brings preferred and non-preferred ends to all; we are all faces with challenges. Need you not, though, to take this seriously. Nature tests all human beings of their strength thus, revealing one’s character.

Some people think that their life is just a horrible misfortune. They feel as though the whole world is fine; that only they suffer. Or, at least, that they suffer much more than the rest. 

The truth is, we are all going through adversity. This is inevitable. This is life. This does not mean, though, that we must therefore complain and lament. 

Stoicism is about facing adversity with courage: not letting yourself be disturbed by these non-preferred indifferences. Realise that the only power you possess is over yourself - your will is your own. Choose, then, how you shall use this faculty."
1,"The View From Above (Marcus Aurelius) -:- Pale Blue Dot (Carl Sagan)  

**From Marcus Aurelius:**

Constantly reflect on how swiftly all that exists and is coming to be is swept past us and disappears from sight. For substance is like a river in perpetual flow, and its activities are ever changing, and its causes infinite in their variations, and hardly anything at all stands still; and ever at our side is the immeasurable span of the past and the yawning gulf of the future, into which all things vanish away. Then how is he not a fool who in the midst of all this is puffed up with pride, or tormented, or bewails his lot as though his troubles will endure for any great while? (5.23)

Think of substance in its entirety, of which you have the smallest of shares; and of time in its entirety, of which a brief and momentary span has been assigned to you; and of the works of destiny, and how very small is your part in them. (5.24)

For all things are swift to fade and become mere matter for tales, and swiftly too complete oblivion covers their every trace. And here I am speaking of those who shone forth with wonderful brightness; as for all the rest, the moment that they breathed their last, they were out of sight, out of mind. And what does it amount to, in any case, everlasting remembrance? Sheer vanity and nothing more. What, then, is worthy of our striving? This alone, a mind governed by justice, deeds directed to the common good, words that never lie, and a disposition that welcomes all that happens, as necessary, as familiar, as flowing from the same kind of origin and spring. (4.33)

&amp;#x200B;

**From Carl Sagan:**

Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known."

1,"Responding poorly to life's current challenges About a year ago I considered myself a good practicing stoic. The challenges I experienced then weren't easy necessary but I felt equipped to deal with them. 

Now life brings new challenges with the shutdown abd everything else going on in the world. Honestly, I've resorted to drinking/smoking weed to get through the isolation. The last few days I've done nothing productive save from feeding myself. 

I've tried quitting but I find so little joy in current life that the boredom always sucks me back in. I'm not even sure why I'm posting this. I guess I need to get back to reading the basic stoic texts, it's been a minute since I've read those. It's hard to reframe the isolation as a positive. I know my emotions are a result of my perception, not circumstances, but still it's really hard to ""love thy fate"" right about now"

1,"Stoici technics to deal wuth concentration. Since the last year I found myself in love for a wonderful woman. She ia awesome, interesting, smart and beautiful by every means I could expect, and fortunately for me she is in love with me too. I am pretty happy about how our relationship has become stronger and stronger, but I also noticed that it came with a problem. I've been getting more and more distracted. I can't keep 10 minutes without thinking about her. Sometimes I remember our moments together, sometimes I imagine little surprises to do to her, sometimes I imagine possible scenarios in the future. I've been noticing that it makes me lose too much time every day. Literally everything I do reminds me of her and makes me stop to think about her. I might spend hours per day like that. Even the ordinary paths I take in the streets are now taking more time because I'm too distracted while walking. I fell in love other times in the past, but never like that, even when I was a teenager, less experienced and more emotional. I imagine that in a long term it will pass naturally, but I am afraid that my current situation might drag me away from my positive habits. This quarantine allowed me to reset my life, but in the last 2 months I'm feeling I'm losing my good routines because everything takes too much time and gives me laziness. It is as if the fact that simply by thinking on her, my brain got more dopamine. 

I know that it is ""stoically"" wrong by its literature and the rational side of me says that I have to do something. I but I don't know what to do. I wanna know if someone ever felt like that and/or is someone knows something practically to prevent myself of get lost in my imagination like that."

1,"A fine piece of Stoic wisdom... From Epicurus himself!

By pleasure we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble in the soul. It is not an unbroken succession of drinking-bouts and of merrymaking, not sexual love, not the enjoyment of the fish and other delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life; it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest disturbances take possession of the soul.... For this reason prudence is a more precious thing even than the other virtues, for a life of pleasure which is not also a life of prudence, honor, and justice; nor lead a life of prudence, honor, and justice, which is not also a life of pleasure. For the virtues have grown into one with a pleasant life, and a pleasant life is inseparable from them."
1,"Need serious help! I'm Paranoid.(Physical pain too) Hey, 

If you reading this kindly bare with me I don't know how long this post is gonna be ,but I will summarise a TL;DR section, somehow. 


So I'm a 21 year old Musician. I just realised and felt Paranoia at its worst. 

The back story of why I'm being paranoid, 

There is this guy probably 5 years older than me, he used to live in my old appartment building he was in 1st floor and i was in second floor, and that guy happens to also be friends with a guy who bullied me. I didn't know about that until a year of knowing him and after I knew he was friends with a guy who hit me when I was 15 I never spoke to him after wards and it wasn't the only reason to stay away from him he was such a pot head and goofy class A pervert and nobody in the appartment building likes him and anyone who sees him first will try to stay away from him, now that I explained who he is. Let me tell what he did to me. 

On October 19th last month he just texted me out of nowhere asking my new home address.  I was confused for a moment because I told him a year ago when I was vacating my old home as a sense of respect, and also he was like my neighbour and it would be rude to say not to. So with that said I was so confused because he didn't tell me why he wanted my address and after asking a few times he said something stupid that didn't make any sense, also he was very specific and asked me to send my current location I was overly confused by this time because I haven't seen or talked to this guy in a year. 

Ok so what does this have to do with me being paranoid right? Let me explain you guys remember that he was friends with the guy who bullied me, and you guys remember that I won't talk to him that much well I made that very apparent and transparent with him, that he too knows that I hated him and that I wanted him to know about that.

Ok with that being said, I thought that he was plotting to beat me along side the bullies he was friends with. I know this isn't true and he doesn't have that big of brain or a solid vengeance over me to do so, but my mind kept on building these Stories, this type of imaginary scenarios happen in my mind since I was a child, for example I had a constant recurring thought that I was fuckin my maths teacher like when I was 10 or something at that point I won't be stimulated by lust so my maths teacher kissing me was a nightmare to me and I couldn't able to control that type of a thought for like weeks it will come in my dreams when I'm watching tv it will even bypass and flash as I'm deeply involved in someother stuffs like studies and as I aged some real life problems made me think that way and it will stay on my head for weeks or even months. 

Ok so back to the current Paranoia I'm dealing with , I'm paranoid since I received that text from him and it's slowly growing and growing and after a few days after that text my stomach(abdomen,I guess) started to like arrested and stuns my physical movements and slows down my work. It's not necessarily pain but it's something you feel when you are suddenly so afraid of something like when you see a ghost or something but for me this arrested thing is staying with me for a week now and it's slowly becoming painful. And It increase in arresting sensation when I ever I get paranoid over the thought I mentioned and for the past two days it got even worse I couldn't fall asleep I wanted to kill that guy or break his bones for destroying my peace by landing a text asking my personal info by being creepy. But he hasn't done any physical harm to me (also he can't if he wanted to) or talked to me in a threatening way all he did was sending a single sentence of text that involed my personal information and now I'm paranoid over that. 

Also I can't blame him cuz he just sent me a text and did nothing else, but my mind is like sub consiously belived that he is trying to whoop me up, I keep on saying it to myself but sub consiously that thought is haunting me. 

The thing I'm experiencing is clearly paranoia and this is the first experience where I'm feeling physical discomfort for like a week over something that has like 0.1% percentage chance of happening. And also this is the first time I'm being affected by a external human's actions, and that pissees me off. I even thought that I might be like a real crazy person because if this happened another person he won't be paranoid like me

So how should I deal with this, my work life is also affected in a way.

TL;DR

For those skimming.

Im so paranoid over something that has like 0.1% chance of happening. 

Paranoid symptoms. 

Arrested stomach or abdomen
Can't move freely as I used to before
Paranoid thoughts Poppin in the middle of the work and when sleeping.

Having these symptoms for a week as it was slowly building and still having now as I type and also today its a little bare-able.

Also this is my first ever physical discomfort I'm facing tho have faced paranoia before as a child.

Thanks and someone plse help me, and how do stoics deal with Paranoia this severe, and has anyone felt Paranoia over some others actions? 

This is something I can't control meditation doesn't help cuz this weight in my stomach is too heavy.

Please help me."
1,You can’t control what the world does... 
1,Do you think it's right as a stoic to stand up for yourself if people are taking the piss out of you? 
1,"Which book to start as a beginner I recently purchased 3 books from the great stoics: 
Meditations by Marcus Aurelius
Discourses and Selected Writings by Epictetus
Letters to a Stoic by Seneca

I started reading Seneca first because it was the first one that came in, i didn't get too far and i do enjoy it but it doesn't seem to be sinking in as easily. Basically the question is should i continue with Seneca or maybe move to Epictetus or Marcus? Just to be sure i can get my brain ready to understand the more challenging writings."
1,"Prety new to Stoicism- help with pre-emotions As far as I've been able to glean, Stoicism differentiates between the initial involuntary physical flash of emotion and your experience when you consciously interact with those physical feelings. I am doing a lot better with the latter part- reminding myself that just because I feel panic that I don't need to feel fear for the future. 

The part I'm struggling with: ""Therefore, when some terrifying sound comes…or something else of the same sort happens, the mind of even the wise man cannot help but be disturbed, and shrink, and grow pale for a moment, not from any anticipation of some evil, but because of certain swift and unconsidered motions which forestall the action of the intellect and the reason [...]"" - Epictetus

In the moment, when struggling with those physical sensations, what do you do? For example, if I am at work and something suddenly reminds me of an adverse past event and I feel like I can't breathe or I cry, how do I simply continue to do my job? I can intellectually understand that these events were in the past, but my body isn't so sure about it, and it's very difficult to do my job while struggling with those physical sensations (for some reason customers don't enjoy when you cry.)

It seems like the Stoics find practice to be the best remedy for this, but although in some situations and with work, the panic has diminished, in others, the chemicals flooding through my brain and body seem as undiminished as ever. 

At home, it is easier to accept that these things occur and ride it out, but it interferes with work and school. What is a Stoic way to handle it?"
1,"Is Stoicism compatible with worldly goals? Some historical Stoic figures (Marcus Aurelius, Seneca) had important responsibilities in goverment, great wealth etc. Today, Stoicism seems to be popular among some succesful entrepreneurs, influencers etc.

At the same time Epictetus said that if, besides aiming for inner goals (such as serenity no matter what happens) we also aim at outer goals like power and riches, than we will probably not gain the latter - and certainly not the former. 

What do you think and what is your experience?"
1,"Stoicism for a Better Life - Weekly exercise (November 4) Hello there, 

For this week’s exercise, let us find some inspiration from an often overlooked Stoic teacher Gaius Musonius Rufus. This is from the translated fragments by Cynthia King \[*Stobaeus 3.1.48* = 3.1. 77. Chapter 1: about virtue.\]:

&gt;""It is not possible to live well today unless you treat it as your last day.""  

Little known fact, Musonius Rufus was Epictetus' teacher, and he was so revered for his knowledge of philosophy that he has been called the Socrates of Rome. Personally, I believe Socrates was so unique that there could never be a Socrates of ""XYZ"". I mean his impact on philosophy was so significant that we even split philosophy into Pre and Post Socratic eras. However, this does not take away from Musonius Rufus's insights into life, philosophy and impact on posterity starting with his Stoic students (or Prokoptons).

I chose this quote above because this cuts to the heart of the Stoic philosophy. A cornerstone of this school of thought is always trying to be aware of the immanence of death. Our impermanence is a reality that we tend to ignore all too often, and this ignorance is directly responsible for a detrimental paradigm shift that our ancient guides constantly warns us against.

Our lives are short. We can exit this temporal existence at any time. So we must try and accomplish our goals right now. And what are these goals? Being virtuous and always working towards the betterment of humanity. **So as a practical exercise this week, focus your energies in each moment...in each act...in each conversation as if it is your last one.** You will find that at the end of the day as you reflect on your efforts, you will find a sense of peaceful pride and tranquillity as it relates to your efforts.

Let me know how you felt, and whether treating each moment as the last one gave you a sense of peace and tranquillity in your efforts. This exercise really can help you find that inner tranquillity with indifference to externals.

1,"Is it OK for couples to swear or name-call when fighting? For me, the most important foundation of a relationship is respect, so I want a relationship where even when we fight, we don’t swear or call things name.

But I am open to perspective, and I wrote in this sub because I think this can offer me more wisdom than posting on r/relationship_advice. 

My boyfriend has temper problems. I’ve tried and been trying for him to see my point of not swearing or name-calling, but he still does it. His own side is because I pushed him, and if I don’t push him, he won’t swear.

The reason this time why I pushed him was rather ridiculous. Maybe, I am at fault here. 

So, we both agreed a year ago that we wouldn’t talk about his ex anymore. However, he talked about her 2 nights ago that she broke his laptop, and she actually still has to pay him. Take note that they haven’t talked for 3 years now, because that’s how long we’ve been together. 

So, my jealousy or curiosity kicked in. I asked him if he was happy that they broke up. He said he couldn’t really say it. I got hurt. I asked him why. And he just said well, at the time it was the best decision. 

But I was still hurt, because it made me feel he doesn’t love me. So I asked him again the same question I asked him a year ago, who he really loves. And he got angry and said, “Holy shit. This is so fucking annoying. How many times do I have to fucking tell you the same answer? Stop asking me these idiotic questions.”

And I explained to him that his not saying clearly whether he was happy or not that they broke up created doubts in my head again about his feeling. 

He responded that he was just thinking what would it be like if they didn’t break up. Again that fucking hurt me, so I asked him why would he think that way? He said because it would give him a different future. A bad or a good one. But knowing how they ended, he thought it would be a bad future and anyway it was over that he didn’t love him nor wanted to be with her anymore.

But my doubts are messing up my mind :(

But anyway, so I told him to stop swearing then or call things name (Idiotic questions). He said I shouldn’t push him, and he will have motivation to actually change that because he said I was not doing my effort also to change on not pushing him.

And I was just thinking in my head that it’s not that I push him, but he clearly has problems managing his temper which we both know.

He also told me I was so full of myself and I should get over it (this is name-calling too, is it not?) and said cancer whore (not to me, but his expression when he gets mad in his own language). I still called him out on it and he said I should stop overreacting because he didn’t say to me but more like saying, “Fuck!”

So, is it okay for couples to fight with swearing? Name-calling? I told him so many times not to do these things. :( but maybe I also have fault cause I push him by asking the same questions."
1,How to convert my anger into something positive? My family is in one of those Whatsapp group chats and misinformation spreads like wildfire on there. I've tried to logically break down some things that are shared instead of getting angry at them but instead I'm either met with silence or they argue with me and continue spreading misinformation which in turn inadvertently gets me angry. Feels like none of them actually listen to me or care enough to look at links I shared. I don't want to leave the group because I feel like that would just be giving up and also they are my family so I love them and we do share positive things with each other.

1,"Shit happens. You do not get to choose what the shit is, who it happens to, where it happens, when it happens, or how often it happens. You may never get to know why it happens.

What you do get to choose is to not dwell on it and to not let it cause you any disturbance. You get to choose how much it effects your overall outlook on life, your attitude, and your will. You get to choose how much, if any, emotions you invest in the shit that has happened. You get to choose whether or not the shit defines you, or if it strengthens you.

1,"On the Easy Way Out Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote “I hate quotation. Tell me what you know.” And yes, the irony that I’m quoting him isn’t lost on me, but hear me out!  

Emerson was referring to people’s tendency to just regurgitate only what they’d heard when faced with a thought provoking question. Hearing this made me think of all the times when I’d go “Oh well this Stoic/an old Professor/my Grandpa said ...” whenever asked a question. Honestly, that can be just an easy way out of thinking or acting; repeating only what we’ve read, but not expanding with personal insight.  

I’m still fairly new to practicing Stoicism, so perhaps this exercise won’t fully fit here. This week try to not react to a question or issue with only a quote in mind, but strive to think of your own take on it. My personal goal is to not try to take the easy way out; to actually put forth effort to a solution. Maybe this helps someone, but in any case, thanks for hearing me out."
1,"Is there such a thing as safety? And would a stoic strive for such a thing? I just watched that video of the dude playing the piano during a protest turned violent, and surprisingly the majority of the top comments were all people saying that he should be focused on leaving the scene rather than playing the piano. Obviously one could say that it would be the ""safe"" move to leave a violent scene, but it kind of bothered me. 

In the video the man was never once harmed by anyone and just kept playing along as the situation unfolded. So, what if he were to leave the scene instead &amp; somehow ended up getting caught up in the violence? Everyone in the comments was so focused on safety but I feel like that goes against the point of stoicism. 

We literally cannot control anything other than our own actions and safety is never guaranteed. Driving your car is one of the most dangerous things in the world but you don't see people complaining about how unsafe it is on a regular basis. So is there even such a thing as safety? I thought the point of stoicism was to do what you feel is right to yourself and whatever fate lies ahead is unchangeable. Therefore you cannot be worried about safety because it is something you can't control. You can certainly avoid doing stupid things, but who's to say that doing the ""safe"" thing rather than the ""stupid"" thing is any less likely to cause you harm? I think that video represented stoicism incredibly well (unless I just don't understand it) because while chaos was unfolding all around the man, he peacefully minded his own business and kept on playing the piano because he wanted to. Our world is entirely chaotic whether you'd like to admit it or not, and to me there is only relatively safety yet it's just a fleeting sense of security in reality. So I guess I'm just left wondering if safety is real and/or could safety even be something that stoics try to strive for? 

TLDR: people wouldn't stop complaining about the dude playing piano because it wasn't the smart or safe decision when in reality safety isn't necessarily real, it's just a false sense of security that we like to give ourselves. 

However if you have another viewpoint I'm genuinely curious about this topic and I'm by no means saying I'm right. I would love for someone to provide me with more information or another point of view!"
1,"“Equanimity is achieved through tattoos, calendars, and references to popular culture. Think of Stoicism as a brand.” - Musonius Rufus This is personally one of my favorite quotes by Rufus. It really encapsulates the idea of Stoicism not being a haughty, pedantic philosophy but rather a quirky, superficial fandom. Frankly, people should spend less time reading the original cannon and spend more time pursuing what Stoicism means to them and how it can be propagated to the wider public.

1,"Eating disorders and Stoicism Hi guys, I have struggled with my eating disorder for some time now but only recently started being interested in stoicism, I think it’s a very effective way of life and was wondering if any of you guys might know a way to help me with my eating disorder with a stoic mindset? So here’s my background: I went from anorexia to binge eating, been binging for 2 years, I’d binge weekly, but once I started to eat more normally and freely, the binges started to stop, I went 6 months without binging, I was so happy and felt free. I then moved back to uni, work started piling up, I was stuck indoors all day due to covid, I probably wasn’t eating enough and my eating disorder started to creep back. I then binged. For the first time in 6 months Then the next day I binged. Then a week later I binged and then a week later (today) I’m experiencing extreme hunger and feel like binging. I don’t understand how I can go 6 months feeling totally normal, no extreme hunger, then one relapse causes a spiral downwards, I’m experiencing extreme hunger I don’t know what to do. I’m not upset that I binged as I’ve learnt to forgive myself, I just don’t want to go back to where I was binging every week. If anyone could suggest anything which you think will help that would be great (I’ve done therapy and it didn’t work). Thanks"

When the bullying happened all the moms confirmed that they disagreed with the bully moms behaviour but no one openly spoke about it or addressed it or supported me publicly except for saying other mean gossipy things about the bully.

Now I find out that they all have moved on and l have become the outsider for speaking out.

My daughter is friends with the kids but l have discovered that they have not included us in any plans lately (online birthday parties, social bubble etc)

Can someone help me use a stoic approach to deal with these two especially:

1,Career Hello! I've been studying Stoicism for around 2 years and I'm turning a senior this year in high school. I'm currently trying to pick out on what I should dedicate my studies to from the vast majority of majors and there was a thought that rose to my head. How does someone who pursues a career based on the art industry be able to contribute to society? By this I mean how do they contribute to society based on the four cardinal virtues of Stoicism? Is there even a way to make art without being unvirtuous? All thoughts are helpful and thank you for your time.

In my mind, whatever happens happens. It's a sort of a Stoic outlook, isn't it? Of course, I'm uninformed so I have no idea what either candidate wants other than what my family tells me, ""Trump will do everything right! Biden will turn this into a Socialist country and the world will end!"" 

But I just say, ""Hey, whatever happens happens, and I believe I'll be A-Okay either way. Bear and forbear"". 

Do you guys think this is an appropriate use of Stoic ideas? I just think of the shit the famous Stoics had to deal with. Can't remember the specifics, but Seneca and Musonius were both exiled (one of them multiple times (?)), Epictetus of course was a slave and a cripple, and Seneca as well as Cato the Younger and Socrates (not all Stoics but close enough) were ordered to commit suicide. Surely anything that the 2020 election could throw my way I can handle, and it couldn't be any worse than what these guys had to deal with! Worse case scenario it's a fantastic opportunity to practice Stoic values."

1,"Accepting what is, the struggle of learning to love fate Dear friends,

I have studied most of the basic Stoic texts and tried living according to them for some time now, but I struggle with applying the concept of Amor Fati.

In order to achieve ataraxia, you have to master the Dichotomy of Control, which means that we should accept anything that is outside of our control. This is an 'easy' concept to accept, because we can't change fate, so why would we resist it? However, my struggle lies in taking this to the next level, from simply accepting fate, to loving it.

*Enchiridion 8, Translation unknown: ""Don't seek for everything to happen as you wish it would, but rather wish that everything happens as it actually will, then your life will flow well""* and more of these like The Discourses 4.1.89 and 1.6.1

I understand the usefullnes of loving everything that happens, if you love whatever happens you are invulnerable. Your tranquilitty can not be shaken because nothing unwilling happens.

**But how does one go from accepting fate, to loving it?** How can you turn the most horrible of lifes events as something to be wished? I recently lost someone close to me, and it have accepted this, but how could you possibly rationalize loving these things.

Am i interpreting this incorrectly? Does the change from acceptance to loving of fate happens after years of practice? Is there any reasoning behind this except for 'it usefull'? Any other quotes or letter dealing with this very issue? I'd look to hear your approaches to this.

Thank you"

If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,

If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster

Im very proud of what i accomplished durring my stoic mindset BUT i messed it all up badly. 
I attempted day trading.
I became a lead aerospace welder, welding engine parts for mostly the F-35 fighter jet.
I finally started making money trading while welding. 
Tried my hardest to be a bodybuilder as well 

I did this for a little over a year and it was incredible. But twards the end of that year i was so burnt out i stopped trading, lifting, and quit my welding job due to the fact that i was making awesome money from trading consistently. For a couple weeks after i quit i didnt do anything. Laid around sleeping. Then i picked up trading again when i remembered thats why i quit my welding job. 

I snappedy achilles in half helping puch a car then 4 days later i was diagnosed with epilepsy (again) with 15 partial seizures per day. (Its ""better"" now) 

I lost my stoic mindset. My work ethic, and my ability to continue to improve my day trading skills. Its been 10 months and everyday i try to become stoic again, improve my trading skills (because i make like $100 a day and im struggling to maintain that). But i never stick to it or take it seriously. I just need to stop being a lazy bum. 

I fell into the victim mentality (embarrassingly)

Anyway any advice to get past this? Move locations? New environment? Go back to welding to gain motivation again? I even thought about paying someone to watch over me for a week to keep me on track until  to get it through my head that its the life i want so do what needs to be done. Im not happy with this mindset and Im lost lol

1,"Yet another Memento Mori calendar Hi guys,

I have been seeing these posts about Memento Mori calendars lately which were a lot of fun and an interesting idea. I wanted one where important life events can be shown in a different color on the calendar but couldn't find anything that met my needs, so I went and did it myself! Credit to /u/Ender_Guardian for posting the one that I based this on (In [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/ji00bx/memento_mori_calendar/ga5kwvi/) thread).

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XApvl4iO_Z_pYSdz-g1HN82dhST16y_oCZx5aZZwPHY/copy

There are 2 sheets: the Calendar itself, and an Important Dates sheet where you add the date and color you would like those events to show up as. In order to use it, you'll want to change the Birthdate at the top of the Calendar tab to your own (give it a minute after doing this, it takes time for everything to recalculate) and add your events to the Important Dates tab. There are a couple of example dates added already.

A few notes:

* Each dot isn't exactly 1 week. There are 52 rows for each year, 1 per week, which leaves 1 extra day (2 on leap years). Those extra days get lumped into the last week of the year. 1 column = exactly 1 year

* If you enter 2 important dates that fall on the same week, the color of the one highest on the list will take precedence

* I only added a few colors. It seems that conditional formatting in Google Sheets won't allow for dynamic color based on what you enter into a cell which was my original plan. More colors could be added, if someone is interested just ask and I'll post what you'd need to change in order to do that

* I really wanted to be able to hover over a cell and see what event happened on that date, but again this is apparently a feature that Google Sheets doesn't have.

* I also wanted to add the ability to enter date ranges (so, for example, your entire tenure at a job could be a block of one color) which I'm sure Google Sheets can handle, but I'm having trouble coming up with a way to do it that isn't a giant clusterfuck. A workable hack would be to enter a separate row for each week of the event that you want to show.

* There's a hidden Calculations tab, and I also protected most of the cells that shouldn't be changed. All of this can be overridden and the protection is mostly just warnings, not a hard stop. My goal was to make it simple to use and hard to accidentally break."

1,"Close friend growing bored of me My best friend, which we share an online friendship, has asked me if she shall borrow my Netflix password. The Netflix belongs to my sister, though, I have my own account - which I do not know the password of. I told her, then, that I cannot give it to her. Not at this point, at least. She was not happy about this. As a result, she didn’t have any will to talk to me for 2 days. Even though she would not admit that the cause of her feeling upset was due to the Netflix thing, it’s clear that it was - else her mood would not have suddenly changed straight afterwards. 

We often video call every night, or at least every second night. Not lately, though, since she has been feeling annoyed with me; also, because she has been busy. She is no longer annoyed with me however, and has found time tonight to talk to me (video call). I was speaking to her about something to which she clearly showed she lacked interest; for she was doing her own thing rather than listening. Thus, I suddenly stopped speaking about it. I said, “It seems like you’re not interested.” She stated she wasn’t interested, that I’m boring. Next, she had informed me that he was joking, which I knew wasn’t the case, “I suspect you’re joking; that you merely say that to cover up the fact that you do lack interest - so that I shan’t be upset to the end I may believe you were kidding when you weren’t” she admitted that was true. 

She concluded that I can boring and that she needed to sleep because she starts school at 6am tomorrow. Even though that’s true that she must sleep somewhat early - I wondered if it was her way to escape the boredom of talking to me.  I feel upset because it’s clear that she lacks interest in what I say. I do not expect her to like the subjects I enjoy nor those I speak about. Yet, she lacks interest in nearly anything I say. For the past couple of times I have seen that sometimes she has no interest in the topics I speak about. So, i note it so that I shall not talk about it again. Hence, when I suspected she lack of interest in what i was saying today, to which I suddenly halted,  I told her that I shall not bother to change subjects, but rather asked her what she would like to talk about. Yet, she didn’t bring anything up. At the end, she explained that there’s nothing wrong with me, that I should be myself, only that sometimes she isn’t interested in what i say (In truth, it’s more than sometimes actually.) I do not expect her to like everything I talk about - for that is impossible. Also, I’m glad that i am aware of the fact that she got bored of the topic I was talking about so that i know not to speak it again, else o would talk about the same topics which she dislikes and now have a clue about it’s To me, though, she should at least listen to me. I have defined a best friend, in a way, that is somebody who you can talk to (nearly) anything about. And, as a best friend, they would at least listen and show respect. I’m not happy about this - she would at least have some idea that I’m not happy. 

This event only took place just then. I’m unsure where to go from here, as in, should I just move on without making it a deal? Or, should we have a proper conversation about this so I can clearly state how unhappy I am about this. Is she really doing anything wrong also? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

As a once religious Muslim who is striving to better himself through Stoicism I find it very difficult to tell the truth regardless of the situation. I have 3 examples I'd like to give and would like them to be examined and maybe justified or outright being acts of vice.

1) I lie to my family and extended family on a daily by them believing that I am a practising Muslim. As progressive as they are, I believe some wouldn't be able to handle the truth and I fear being disowned. So I proceed with putting on the image of a practising Muslim. 

2) I lie to my sucidual and clinically depressed ex girlfriend, I lie and say I have not been with other women. To spare her feelings and make sure she is okay. Seeing as I am the only stable individual in her life that deeply cares and loves her. (I have made a commitment to tell her I'm a few days regardless of what may happen) 

3) I live in a SEA country and lied to the police about my passport getting stolen. I did this to get a police report and get a new passport. I actually lost it, and getting a police report that way would take a lot of time and may not even work then. 

Are these excuses valid. I would rather stay truthful all the time. However, certain situations seem to be impossible to solve with truth. I would like some guidance on regards to being truthful for these situations.

This book contains a profound conversation between an Irish and Chinese immigrant, bother highly intelligent. They discuss the bible, more specifically the story of Cain and Able. The Chinese immigrant, Lee, points out that the translation from Hebrew to English has perverted the meaning of the story.   

The Hebrew word, Timshel, had been mistranslated according to Lee. He argues that the word, which translated to thou shalt in the King James Bible and used in the context of conquering sin, really meant thou mayest.   

So, according to Lee, the original intent of this passage was thou mayest conquer over sin. That man has a choice over what his fate is and how he reacts to reality. This has had a profound effect on who I am as a person, and I thought it might be interesting to share with the group. We all have the opportunity to choose who we are and what decisions we make.  

(Mods, I'd love a timshel flair. I'm not a tattoo guy, though if I was, timshel would be my choice. Reddit flair is my only other option.)

Timshel, ladies and gentleman. With the continuing instability that covid has created and the instability that looms over the US presidential election, please stay safe."

1,"How to handle anxiety or pain caused by other people? Often someone close to us such as a significant other, sibling, parent, close friend etc. might talk to us in a way that induces emotional reaction: resentment, anger, worry, pain, anxiety, sadness etc. Even if they are not directly criticizing us or realize they are doing it. I know we should try to calm our emotions, but what happens when someone else fuels it?

I have been studying Stoicism this year and realize that one should try to separate internal from external. Sometimes it feels like no matter how much I separate my emotions, others can disturb the peace."

1,"Being a stoic does not mean being indifferent to the world around you, it’s realizing what you can and what you can’t control I realized that what I thought it was: a “whatever happens, happens” mindset, was wrong.

The less time you spend worrying, wether it be the past or the future, the more time you have to enjoy life, or the present

My home life growing up was filled with a house of abuse, addictions, death, pain. I was so troubled from this with social anxiety, depression, being a toxic person myself. 

On the other side of things I moved out and worked on myself for years. I’ve grown up with friends, travelled, had relationships, turned my hobby into my job so self employed can work anywhere in the world. 

So have kind of experienced a bit of both good and bad. 

I’m now 28. I’ve let go of a lot of people over the last few years as I feel they weren’t good for me.

I’m now in the town I grew up in bored. Like I have one life on earth I don’t want to just repeat everything but I don’t know what to do next.

1,"What are we in control of? And how do we deal with the things we can't control? As far as I understand it, Stoicism is about focusing on the things we can control, and ignoring the things we can't. Seems simple enough as an idea, but I'm not sure how to put it into practice.

How exactly do we determine the things we can control, for example? Is it if we can see results for it? So if we work hard at something and nothing comes from it, does that mean we should give it up?

And what about the things we can't control, how do we deal with those? Like if I'm worried about getting sick from covid, I probably shouldn't just ignore that. I should research more about it right? See what the experts say I should do to prevent that. But then I could end up spiraling into researching that topic for days on end. I'm not sure where to draw the line, exactly.

Would really appreciate your thoughts on this. I'm just struggling with how to put stoicism into practice exactly."

1,"How many of you have really noticed a change since practicing stoicism? I've always known of the stoic mindset, bit I've only recently become interested in philosophy. I had no when I was younger that there was a philosophy teaching virtue, self control &amp; acceptance. I was only taught religion &amp; I do feel that caused more harm than good in my life, but that's not what's important here.

1,"Be kind to yourself I stumbled across a concept this morning called 'self-compassion' that I think might actually be really useful for others here. You can find a video by the psychologist who's done the leading research on it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvtZBUSplr4). 

The idea is that when you suffer or when you fail, show yourself the same compassion that you would show to a close friend. Abstain from leveling a judgment against yourself. Instead of berating yourself, offer support, ask \*yourself\* what you can do to help.

You're often your own worst critic, which means you risk getting yourself down and getting in your own way. Recognize that you will fail a few times at anything you try. Accept that that's okay! That's part of the process. Give yourself the support you need to forgive yourself and start back up again!

Much of stoicism is about managing your reactions to external events in an emotionally healthy way. And self-compassion seems like another route to doing that. When your child is throwing a tantrum in public and you can't calm them down, show yourself some sympathy for a frustrating situation. Commend yourself for keeping your cool as well as you have so far, and accept that this is pretty uncomfortable. Give yourself the support a friend would offer in these challenging situations.

And even when you fail, there's no need to dwell on how you failed in your journal at the end of the day. Acknowledge that it happened, but beware of ruminating. Say what you would say to a struggling friend. Externalize the problem. Think about it like an outsider peering in. Take the role of that friend who always knows just what to say. What words of support might they offer? What advice might they give?

This isn't an excuse to let yourself do whatever you want. It's a way to avoid being unrealistically hard on yourself. It's a way to keep yourself from getting discouraged. What the stoics outlined is a way of thinking that - to fully adopt all of a sudden - would be like running a marathon without any training. So consider the merits of being your own encouraging workout buddy, rather than an austere trainer."
1,"Wanting to be more stoic about dating (and hopefully indifferent) I'm ready to give up on relationships, and pursue other things in life.

The problem is, when I want to give up, emotionally I feel sad, frustrated, and angry. I just want to not care anymore. 

Whenever a girl compliments me, or says something nice to me, I get a little too infatuated, and think they might be interested in me, and try to get their number, only to get a ""I'll be back"", and to never connect. I know they did not intend to hurt me, but I still receive it as pain.

I do not want to pursue love anymore, as it always hurts to be lonely and to see someone else with someone. I want to truly not care anymore. I believe stoicism is the first step because the rejection, infatuation, feelings of loneliness, dating frustrations, being led on, still hurts and I want it to not hurt me anymore."

1,"A formula for putting Stoic meaning into your Memento Mori calendar. ​[Here](https://www.williambirvine.com/stoic-essay-12) is an article by William Irvine titled ""The Stoic Formula for a Good Life."" He explains from a Stoic point of view why we can live a better life if we occasionally remind ourselves that our time to be alive is finite. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; *X = the number of days you have left to live*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; If you have X days left to live, today will represent 1/X of your life. Thus, if X = 2, today represents 1/2 of your life, and if X = 100, today represents 1/100 of your life. But suppose X were infinite. Then the value of today would be 1/∞, which is equal to 0. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The Stoics spent time contemplating their own death. They didn’t fear death; nor did they fixate on it. But they did periodically entertain flickering thoughts about it. By doing so, they put their daily life into perspective: yes, today may not be going as planned, but it is nevertheless a precious thing. It is one of the X days that I have left to live, so I must not waste it. Indeed, I must do my best to savor it."
1,"How to overcome visceral urges? So recently I've noticed one thing, maybe it's because of my age group that people act like this ( early 20s), that whenever a mutual friend isn't present people start slandering him/her, it might not be malevolent and just banter but still obviously very unstoic, and as people trying to embrace stoicism we should rise above right? 

I find myself joining the slandering by contributing jokes even know I know I shouldn't, I feel the concept of "" group think"" applies here, everyone making jokes about someone who isn't there, I try to divert by saying "" yeah but he's a nice guy"", people say "" yeah ofcourse"" and then begin their jokes again, and I find myself contributing, a friend of mine said everyone does this and it's human but for sure this has to be avoided right? It would be so classy to be able to not indulge in these acts which are being performed by others who know not better. 

What advice do you have for me and for this situation? Surely it's not okay to do this? How can I stay strong and have control over myself in these situations?"

1,"Beginner question: dealing with horrors, how to think about it? Good morning everyone (: I'm only at the outset of my private Stoicism study, and a question came to my mind today while reading enchiridion. Perhaps people more experiences could provide some clues as how to think about the follow from a stoic perspective, preferably with some pointers to source material to study:

In 2011 a terrorist named Anders Behring Breivik bombed out government offices and shot 69 teenagers at a summer camp outside Oslo. Beyond a national trauma, my partner worked at a hospital that received these brutally traumatised patients as they were coming in that night, so the stories became vivid and close. I was also walking near the site the bomb went off, and saw the fires and devastation. At night we did not know how many people had been shot at the camp. 

The morning after I remember crying when I saw the number in the newspapers, and numbing up.

At the time I developed a great anger for the man who did it. I have only felt true hate two people in life: a kid who bullied me in school, and the terrorist Breivik. The hate for Breivik I've come to appreciate as good. It has not fuelled a need for revenge etc., but serves as a truly powerful reminder of what *his* philosophy means in practice.

I wonder now the stoic perspective on this ""useful hatred"", or my emotional reaction to seeing the body count the day after the attack? It seems to me my hatred for Breivik is valuable, but perhaps a dangerous friend to hold close. Opposite to this, it seems my hatred for the boy who bullied me in school is not a good friend, but an irrational reaction. Unlike his actions, I ""own"" my response.

I'm especially curious about source materials that would help me think about these reactions (:"

That nod of approval
That ‘thank you’

It always was

Their insults are echoes of a pain deep within.
Their compliments, reverberations of a soul in harmony
These people are giving us an opportunity
An opportunity to meet a need of theirs
And all we can do in that moment is make it about us

How embarrassing we must feel
That we would confuse their needs for ours

Their need is a gift
A gift we choose to accept or reject

So let us give our gift
Our gift of empathy and understanding

Listen to the need for certainty that shrieks fear into their eyes
Listen to the need for connection that chimes out of joy in their smile
Listen to the need to be held that whimpers mournfully in their tears

Listen to it all
The quite murmurs of what is not said
And then thank them for sharing

Because It was never about you
It was about them"
1,"How to have an argument? Context: I love in the UK

My parents have consistently voted for a political party which i believe has actively hindered my life for the immediate and long term future. Politics is innevitably something that comes up in family discussions, and it's something i feel very passionately about.

I have a lot of love for my parents, and they have given me an incredibly good childhood - so I'm 
cautious of upsetting them, insulting their intelligence, or just straight disrespecting them in any discussions we have about the current political climate. 

It's difficult, as I don't really interact with anybody who votes as they do in my daily life, and I feel like they're my only lightning rod for anger as the only people I know who have different political views from me.

1,"To each their own, but these ’Memento Mori’ graphs make no sense to me... ...you have no idea when you’re gonna die, so charting how much time you have left is non-sensical to my mind. I realize it’s just a graphical abstraction to make a perceptual frame-shift, but it kinda goes against the whole idea of ‘remember death’ if you’re visualizing your having another X number of decades in your life when the graph (your life) could literally end tomorrow. You or someone you love dearly could die tomorrow, so appreciate and live to the fullest this moment right now, that’s the message I take from memento mori. The misconceived perception that I have another 50+ years on the earth is what I’m trying to get away from.

Again, this is just my personal take. If the memento mori graphs do it for you and get you in a mind place to fully appreciate and live life, all the power to you (seriously, I mean that), that’s not what I personally get from these 1/4 to 1/3 filled-in life charts though."

1,"Things don't (always) get better, you get better at dealing with things. To put it more Stoicly, ""Reality doesn't always get better, you get better at accepting reality for what it is, instead of having false perceptions or making assumptions about what the future will be.""

As someone who suffers from depression, a lot of internet strangers and friends and even loved ones have told me ""Just soldier through it, things will get better."". I usually respond by asking if they're a fortune teller, and what the next day's lotto numbers are. We have no guarantee what tomorrow, next week, next year, next decade will be like. We don't even know if we'll live past this moment, let alone to the ripe old age of 80. Making assumptions that ""tomorrow will be better"" will only make us more wretched if/when it is not. **Happiness can only come from the current moment.** When you focus too much on the future, you are taking happiness away from today; because by the nature of comparison when you say tomorrow will be better you are implying that today is worse. 

So, instead of hoping for a better future, it is easier and far more rewarding to just get better at dealing with things. In Stoicism, this simply translates into practicing the ability to judge things for what they are and not what society tells you they should be. Death for example, is not a terrible thing, else it would have appeared so to Socrates. We think it is bad because we've been taught that it is bad. It is within our power as Stoics to be okay with and accept anything that happens to us with equanimity and tranquility. This is done by changing our perceptions of things, not by hoping that those things will conform to our perceptions.

1,What actually matters 
1,"What does Stoicism say on how to control pleasures (fantasizing, porn,etc)? "
1,"Everything that does not affect you directly is not actually your problem.  I was reading Marcus Aurelius’ Meditations and I think an important Stoic concept that he details in it is the process of “zooming out”, that is, sort of trying to place yourself and your issues to scale with the universe. and thereby seeing how small you and your issues actually are. I like to think of and remember this idea when I watch or read the news. news media is not how it used to be. no more 6 o’clock news delivered once a day by Walter Cronkite. no more morning newspaper reads. etc. in 2020 the news companies bombard you with agonizing information because they profit from your continued attention. it is their goal to monetize your fear. anyways, the news is just an example. it’s kind of like that common stoic quote that men are always climbing imaginary mountains in their minds. they are. being stoic is about concern for the tangible issues rather than the ephemeral and ethereal. just as it is important to accept misfortune as an inevitable consequence of life, and not to let it affect you psychologically, so it is important to be able to determine what misfortune is in the first place."
1,"I received the best gift today on my 26th birthday, it is myself.  A year ago on this day, I dreaded waking up because I was 25 and I was a failure, I had become the very person I was trying to avoid, I was directionless, I was angry all the time, I was unhealthy, distracted and depressed. But I never gave up hope and I always knew that someday it's all going to fall in place. Today, I eat healthy, sleep well, meditate every day, run regularly, enjoy the company of my friends and family.  I'm no longer angry at myself or anyone else, I have learnt to let it go. I'm grateful for the life I have and look forward to an optimistic future. I feel comfortable with who I am and who I'm becoming. I am happy and content!

&amp;#x200B;

I made the best decision of my life on 11th January 2020, when I shut down my business that made me feel literally worthless. This made me as free as a bird, as if being let out to do what it wants and explore life. I started working on myself slowly, one thing at a time, kept at it consistently. During this time, I came across stoic philosophy, I pursued it as I felt very relatable to its teachings and the way of life, it lent me a helping hand when I seemed lost and didn't know where the shore was and I'm thankful for it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am the kid who dreamt big, I chased it, I failed and got depressed and felt lost. But I never sold myself short, my mom always asks me when I will flourish and I always used to tell her ""my time will come."" My time has arrived and I am ready to go into battle and flourish as a human being.

1,"I want to bring Stoicism to my business, and my branding. Is there any art that you feel represents this state of mind? Can I get your opinions? It’s not always easy maintaining a line of sight and with all that is going on in the world it would be nice to bring that out in a line of products I will be releasing and selling.

It just stings because I feel as though I have lived my whole life for the benefit of others and to be called apathetic hurt.

It is therefore easy to misunderstand stoicism contradicting at times what the ancient stoics believed."
1,"How do I apply stoic wisdom when it matters? I've been reading quite a lot about stoicism, but when I'm in a situation where I should be using this wisdom I seem to completely forget what I've been reading about. I just act like my old self and only later realise that I should've approached the situation differently. On the other hand when I do recognise such a situation it often leads to anxiety because I desperately try to remember which stoic principles apply best.

I guess what it comes down to is... How can I apply stoicism more naturally? Without really thinking about it. If I had to answer this myself I would say through practice, which might be partially true, but this has been a recurring problem of mine for a while now. Any help is appreciated."

Again, when the proper development has been reached, it is generally followed by decay; that, too, seems like a failure in the work of Phusis.

I'm curious as to what you lot think about him, personally I find his content these days to have deviated from his original stuff and has nothing really to do with stoicism anymore. If anyone has any thoughts, as I'm curious to see the opinions of it."
1,"„He who has a why to live, can bear almost any how“ – Friedrich Nietzsche These words came to me, a few days ago via my amazing friend. I was not able to get under the direct logic implied by the words and comprehend their full meaning as I was suffering what I perceived as an almost unbearable amount of pain, after a personal loss, the details of which bear no importance to the present text.

It was only this morning that I have stumbled upon an interview of Doctor Viktor Frankl that opened my eyes. He stated that Despair - that thing that a lot of times even ends up leading to suicide - is the equivalent of Pain minus Meaning. It’s a simple equation that helped me understand that it was not Pain that made me howl in the midst of a torrent of tears, but Despair. That is the body’s way of dealing with Pain when Meaning is not present. 

You see, an easy example would be a horribly persistent toothache that finally makes you cry! What makes you burst into tears? Is it the pain? Does the pain source go away after you cry? It doesn’t, yet you suffer less. Your body just reacts to the desperation you fell when you think that the intense pain will last forever and it will never drop in intensity.

What if the Meaning behind that toothache is that you need a lesson in oral hygiene and in not skipping your visits to the dentist? I have a vague intuition that this kind of thought process would make it far easier to deal with until the painkillers kick in. Because, you see, using painkillers from time to time is not cheating. But not part of this discussion either.

What was I doing wrong, then? The Pain is real. I can testify to that as I still feel it in my chest right now. That left me only with the lack of Meaning. And it was not my life that I saw no meaning in, but the need to go through the constant rash of pain that felt like it was going to last forever and then some more. 

Another article, written by a gentleman called Ricardo Guaderrama, entitled „Neediness Stinks Like Poop“, that I have read earlier, clarified what the Meaning was: I had to transform from a needy person into a more self reliant one. 

You see, I have allowed myself to depend on another person and a set of rules that I saw as being embedded in the fabric of the Universe. And guess what? It came to light that it was an unreliable person and personal Universe. A very small one, meant only to keep me comfortable.

There is no intrinsic meaning in Pain. The only way you can get that is through your Reason. I feel like most of the religions and philosophies that I know of deal with that exact problem in different ways. I believe they all have some value to them, even if I might not agree with some. 

The Buddhists take what I call „the coward’s approach“ and try to nullify existence to escape Pain. One could argue that they are only a step above people that commit suicide (due to Despair, not to some clinical problem), because the eternal cycle of reincarnation leaves out no escape, other than Nirvana and that needs some work behind it. I would say that the end game is the same in both cases, even if you have different ways of reaching it.

Christians decide to devote themselves to approaching a state close to Divinity. Even if lack of Reason is associated with them nowadays, I find plenty of that in their decision. Otherwise how could you practice self sacrifice for the greater good, against your own self preservation? I find that approach as more noble than the Buddhist approach as they are not turning their backs to Pain, but try to associate meaning to it.

As far as I understand, the Stoic approach would be to use your Reason and see what Virtue or Virtues you were lacking that the Meaning associated to your Pain was lost or was never associated. Were you relying on externals (as I did, for example)? Were you careless with your internals (as I did as well)? Are you lacking Courage, Wisdom, Moderation or Justice? What if you lack more than one of them? Do you not understand that you cannot lose something that was never yours, anyway?

Just to make it clear, this whole thing is only a few hours old. Why I keep repeating to myself is that Despair is Pain without Meaning, each time I feel it circling me. That is probably going to prove not enough at some point, but I feel that I have taken some of my weight off my friend’s back and I can already control what I feel better. And if that is not a double win, I don’t know what else could be …

1,"I always saw my fears and anxiety as a weakness, until i read this: How to think like a Roman emperor - Donald Robertson
“In The Meditations, Marcus himself writes that although he tells troubling impressions to go away, he is not angry with them because they have come according to their “ancient manner”; in other words, they arise in the way basic feelings also arise in animals.That implies that, like the anonymous Stoic teacher on Gellius’s storm-tossed boat, Marcus views them with indifference rather than judging them as inherently bad. Elsewhere he says that pleasant and unpleasant sensations in the body inevitably impinge on the mind because they’re part of the same organism.We shouldn’t try to resist them, but rather we should accept their occurrence as natural, as long as we don’t allow our mind to add the judgment that the things we’re experiencing are good or bad. This is important, because people who confuse “Stoicism” with “stoicism” (i.e., having a stiff upper lip) often think that it’s about suppressing feelings like anxiety, which they view as bad, harmful, or shameful. That’s not only bad psychology, it’s also totally in conflict with Stoic philosophy, which teaches us to accept our involuntary emotional reactions, our flashes of anxiety, as indifferent: neither good nor bad. What matters, in other words, isn’t what we feel but how we respond to those feelings.”"

I thought of this this morning when I getting ready for the day.  With what seems to be a string of endless self-help books in today’s society, it feels like everybody is obsessed with self-improvement, but to the point that they are, as the quote puts it, sharpening their blades without going into battle. As Marcus Aurelius said, “Waste no more time in arguing what a good man should be, be one.” It is important to strengthen your mind and widen your perspective, and this could be achieved by reading, but you have to go out there and face your daily challenges. The key is balance."

So I got very angry just a moment ago. I remembered stoicism in the moment but not fast enough as the situation was already over and the damage was done. I looked inward and thought how did it happen yet again? How did let my emotion decide the action and not my reason choice. 

I found a connection, at least for me, that whenever I start browsing the web mindlessly I seem to forget about my awareness to practice stoicism. I do no doubt think if ""is within my control"", ""it's not the post, but my beliefs making me feel  this negative way"", etc, but for the most part I lose myself, my individuality and become part of the hivemind mentality. Leading to forgetting my reason choice after I get off of browsing.

1,"How often to sit and think about stoicism? If I just try to go and 'apply' stoicism to every aspect of my life, eventually I forget to do it, or something comes around which I don't instinctively have a stoic answer for. To prepare for this, I'd regularly revisit stoic principles by reading and journalling about them, for example. 

But how often? If I do it every day, it starts to feel useless because I'm just doing nothing and idk when any difficult obstacles will come, and it feels like a waste of time when I should be maybe, applying it and practicing actively, or at least being productive in some other aspect of my life. But, reading/writing something stoic once every few days is a difficult habit to keep sometimes. And if I just do that whenever the need arises, then it first requires a need to arise - in other words I allow myself to first fall into error, and only then start revisiting stoicism as a way to fix it. It seems like a poor way to go about it and I can't really imagine Epictetus doing it that way, for example?

So, how often do you suggest me to read stoic texts, journal about it, think deeply about these fundamental principles? And how do I know which principles to focus on today?"

1,"Seneca on what is most important. I was reading some of my saved sections from Seneca and decided to share this since it's somewhat rare and especially well put.

&amp;nbsp;

**Seneca, Natural Questions, 1.11-17:**

&amp;nbsp;

**What is most important?** Raising your mind above the threats and promises of fortune, thinking that nothing is worth hoping for. For what have you to desire? Whenever you sink back from engagement with the divine to the human level, your sight will go dim, just like the eyes of those who return from bright sunlight to dense shadow. 

&amp;nbsp;

**What is most important?** Being able to endure adversity with a glad mind, to experience whatever happens as though you wanted it to happen to you. For you ought to have wanted it to, if you had known that everything happens according to god’s decree. Crying, complaining,  and moaning are rebellion. 

&amp;nbsp;

**What is most important?** A mind that is brave and defiant in the face of calamity, not just opposed but hostile to luxury, neither courting nor fleeing danger; one that knows not to wait for fortune but to create it, to go to face both forms unafraid and undismayed, unshaken either by the turmoil of the one or the glitter of the other.

&amp;nbsp;

**What is most important?** Refusing to let bad intentions enter your mind; raising pure hands to heaven; not seeking any good thing if someone else must give it or must lose it so that it may pass to you; wishing for a sound mind (something that can be wished for without competition); regarding the other things rated highly by mortals, even if some chance brings  them into your home, as likely to exit by the door they entered.  

&amp;nbsp;

**What is most important?** Raising your spirits high above chance events; remembering your human status, so that if you are fortunate,  you know that will not last long, and if you are unfortunate, you know you are not so if you do not think so. 

&amp;nbsp;

**What is most important?**  Having your soul on your lips. This makes you free not according to  the law of the committee, but according to the law of nature. A free person is one who escapes enslavement to himself, which is constant, unavoidable, oppressing by day and by night equally, without break, without relief. 

&amp;nbsp;

Enslavement to oneself is the most severe enslavement, but it is easy to shake it off if you stop expecting a lot from yourself, if you stop making money for yourself, if you set before your eyes both your nature and your age, even if it is very young, and say to yourself, “Why am I going crazy? Why am I panting? Why am I sweating? Why am I working the land, or the forum? I don’t need much, and not for long.”"

I was with my ex for four years and she left me about 10 months ago, I’ve been doing alright for the last few months reading meditations really helped me. She’s found someone new and honestly it’s really hurt me, how would stoicism tackle this situation? Obviously I want advice on how stoic people would hence why I’ve came to this place, thanks guys."
1,"Need guidance in managing expectations Like many people out there I had a very challenging year and even daily stoicism reminders and breathing exercises didn't help and I spent the spring and summer in depression. In late August, I got a well-paid and stable job and things started to get better. A few weeks back, I took some concrete actions to realise my childhood dream and applied to a PhD programme. Last week, I had one of the best interviews in my life. The interview was so unexpectedly good that during the interview, the professor who's responsible for the PhD students in the department asked me to send a mail to her to put me in touch with another scholar who's also focusing on the same subject. There were a lot of nodding, agreeing and smiling. The department will inform me with their decision by December but I'm struggling with managing my expectations. I can't stop imagining about living the dream I've been dreaming for years, being part of a university that I wanted to be, doing the things that I wanted to do...While dreaming these makes me happy and I find myself smiling, I also realise there may be other candidates who were as good or better than me. So, I'm asking for a stoic guidance in managing the expectations. Please tell me any books/articles/podcasts etc. you have used or you suggest me to use that can guide me in managing my hopes and expectations. I really don't want to go back into depression but I'm scared that when I'm very close to achieving my dream a ""no"" can tip things over in my mental health.   
Thanks,"

1,"How similar is Stoicism to Mindfulness? I've been practicing Mindfulness meditation for almost an year now and tried to make some changes in my life which include:-
1. Living in the present moment
2. Ability to identify my thoughts and not engaging with those which can lead to strong emotions
3. Trying to enjoy and express gratitude for small things in life
4. Not engaging with things which are not under my control- I've reduced my news consumption for this reason
5. Trying to attain greater awareness of myself through meditation practices
6. Not resisting negative thoughts and feelings and realising that 'They too shall pass'

I was discussing this with a friend a few days back and he said this is very similar to Stoicism, which made me explore Stoic philosophy to an extent.

So was curious to know if these two practices are similar or not? Also, what are the key differences between them if any?"

However, from a recent experience, I'm starting to appreciate the misses as much as the wins thanks in part to some stoic thinking.  I wanted to share in case it would encourage other young men.  


Recently, I had been going on several dates with someone who I truly enjoyed being around. However, after the 8th date (a big number for me since I rarely want to go on a 2nd), we both figured that taking the next step into a relationship wasn't wise. (Our senses of humor didn't match.)  


At the tail end of our our last phone convo, something she said struck me, ""Even though this didn't work out, I know something good will come of this.""   


I agreed with her and explained the concept of ""Amor fati"", to love fate. That whatever happens becomes fuel for the fire of your life.  I love this concept, especially because it ties in to a biblical verse (I'm a Christian). "" We know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.""   


The core concept has given me plenty of peace the past few days,  and I hope it can for you, too.

1,"Question about Meditations So I started reading Meditations and in the part about Marcus Aurelius (what a badass that guy is btw, look what he endured and how handled it) before book 1 there is a sentence about stoicism and repressing emotions

“There were under the early empire two rival schools which practically
divided the field between them, Stoicism and Epicureanism.
The ideal set before each was nominally much the same.
The Stoics aspired to the repression of all emotion,
and the Epicureans to freedom from all disturbance; yet in
the upshot the one has become a synonym of stubborn endurance,
the other for unbridled licence.”

What do they mean with repressing emotions ? In my mind it means not acknowledging them and not allowing them to exist, fighting against the emotion itself and not letting it be. (Again, against the emotion itself, not talking about letting the emotion rule me or not) In my mind this doesn’t sound very good for your mental health, at least not in my experience with myself. 

Am I interpreting this the right way/way it was intended to or not ?"

1,"Am I acting self-righteously? After I started immersing myself in Stoicism, my courage have greatly increased, I feel that I now have a purpose in life, to act according to virtue, and to do what is right, I no longer worry about outcomes, If there something that I should do, then it should be done, people who live their entire life standing up for nothing are wasting it for good, and nothing good may come out of cowardice, we didn't come to this world to live comfortably, sometimes you need to act, and your act may make your life harsher, but it still better than living in a bubble with no purpose, shielded from any criticism or danger.   


But I can't help but feel that I'm being that self-righteous prick that everyone dislikes, today while coming home, I found a pet shop that kept a monkey outside in a cage exposed to sun light, I felt that it is my duty to say something, to do something, at this very moment I just wanted to believe as much as I could that this monkey wasn't suffering, but in reality it was, I didn't do anything at that moment, partly because I wanted to know my options, selling monkeys is illegal in my countries, so I thought about calling the police, but after I rang my brother who's an officer, he told me that the police doesn't care about such things, and there is no one I could call, he still sympathized with me and agreed to give that shop an unofficial visit tomorrow.   


Now for some reason I'm starting to feel like I'm acting self-righteous, and it is a bad feeling, anyone else can relate to this?"
1,"The Stoic Universe - Everything Flows From Here  *""Whatever may happen to thee, it was prepared for thee from all eternity; and the implication of causes was from eternity spinning the thread of thy being and of that which is incident to it.""* \- Meditations, Marcus Aurelius

Stoicism as a philosophy depended on its theory of the universe to justify its maxims, as it should be for any philosophy to be more than a mere exercise in motivational coaching and psychotherapy. It held that the world at large was eternal, yet ever changing, and imbued with reason and intelligence. This they inherited from the wisdom of Heraclitus, which posited a world driven by a mystic Fire. From the Stanford [Encyclopedia](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/#Phys) we have this passage:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; *the Stoic God is immanent throughout the whole of creation and directs its development down to the smallest detail. The governing metaphor for Stoic cosmology is biological, in contrast to the fundamentally mechanical conception of the Epicureans. The entire cosmos is a living thing and God stands to the cosmos as an animal’s life force stands to the animal’s body, enlivening, moving and directing it by its presence throughout.*   

There is a prevailing current in modern science, starting around the time of Descartes, to view the world as an entirely mechanical operation. It's all machinery moving about without any particular direction. A thought shared by the Epicureans - you can see how they would justify their pursuit of pleasures in a world devoid of reason in this manner, and how the Stoics would justify their pursuit of wisdom as an opposing plan. Thus the importance of having a well defined worldview that underpins all the particular instances of philosophical thought. Merely practicing ""memento mori"" doesn't mean anything if one believes the universe is meaningless and random. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; *More specifically, God is identical with one of the two ungenerated and indestructible first principles (archai) of the universe. One principle is matter which they regard as utterly unqualified and inert. It is that which is acted upon. God is identified with an eternal reason (logos, Diog. Laert. 44B ) or intelligent designing fire or a breath (pneuma) which structures matter in accordance with Its plan (Aetius, 46A)*  *The designing fire is likened to sperm or seed which contains the first principles or directions of all the things which will subsequently develop (Aristocles in Eusebius, 46G) .*  

This world of fire is intuitively similar to the modern theory of cosmological growth of the universe. The Big Bang says in part that the universe spent hundreds of thousands of years as an immense ball of atomic fire. The remaining signal of this era is called the Cosmic Microwave Background or CMB for short. This is all well and good, but it still isn't enough to be the Stoic universe. After all, doesn't the Big Bang say that the universe had a beginning? Doesn't that mean that the world isn't Eternal? Well yes and no - We do know that the universe had a hot and dense origin, but everything before the era of the CMB is pure speculation. The Big Bang theory is only a hypothesis based on an extreme interpretation of Einstein's theory of General Relativity. Yet it is by design untestable since it demands a point of infinite energy, which is a scientifically unsound postulate. Even Einstein didn't really believe in it. At his time, scientists believed in a steady state model, where the universe remained equal during all times, never really evolving. Stoicism offered a middle ground solution between steady state and the big bang theory, millenia before our time - The world is eternal, yet ever changing, and it is born from fire and returns to fire. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; *Just as living things have a life-cycle that is witnessed in parents and then again in their off-spring, so too the universe has a life cycle that is repeated. This life cycle is guided by, or equivalent to, a developmental plan that is identified with God. There is a cycle of endless recurrence, beginning from a state in which all is fire, through the generation of the elements, to the creation of the world we are familiar with, and eventually back to the state of pure designing fire called ‘the conflagration’ (Nemesius, 52C).* 

But this is all just theoretical speculation from ignorant people who didn't know modern science, you might be thinking. ""Modern Stoics are atheists and mechanistics, nobody takes this seriously anymore!"" No, not, you'd be wrong about all of these rebuttals. There are truly scientific models of just such a world. A universe marked by repeating cycles of birth by fire and rebirth is completely possible according to the latest theories of quantum mechanics and general relativity. There has even been advances in finding experimental evidence of such events in recent years with promising results. True, it isn't the most popular idea, but it is a true possibility. It is called [Conformal Cyclic Cosmology](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=conformal+cyclic+cosmology), and its principal proponent, Roger Penrose is a nobel prize winning cosmologist - so it's not merely the vaggaries of random intellectuals.

See this PBs video for an explanation of the theory: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC2JOQ7z5L0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC2JOQ7z5L0)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; *Whether the soul of the world called a man to be surrounded by pleasures or tortured to death, whatever happens is appropriate to the rational design of the universe. Thus, the wise man should be indifferent and accept the things over which he has no control, letting his soul live in conformity to the divine plan of the universe.*   
&gt;  
&gt; *The stoic, therefore, sought happiness not through the amassing of pleasures, but through living in conformity with the design of the universal being, the soul of the world or pneuma. This was believed to be the height of stoic virtue: to be above passions, to receive pain as readily as pleasure, and to calmly and rationally withhold assent from false judgments, accepting whatever fate sends you.* 

&amp;#x200B;

This is from a modern critic of Stoicism from a Catholic point of view [(source)](http://tradcatknight.blogspot.com/2016/05/stoic-philosophy-and-catholic-critique.html) but he's right in his interpretation, if of a pessimistic view of it. It is precisely because the Stoic believes that the Universe has *reason* and *causation* that the Stoic assents to Fate*.* Forget all the calendars, coins, remembrances, quotes, amulets, paintings - none of that will help you when Fate comes knocking on your door and you have no clue why. 

Without a belief in a *Stoic World*, all the *Stoic Memes* are mere rhetoric."

1,Looking for quote and advice I have recently undergone surgery to repair 4 hernias. The pain is quite extreme and quite constant. I understand that a reaction to pain can be stoic as it is still natural to wince or to hunch over while walking because standing straight might cause me to blackout. But I'm searching for advice on how people avoid the self pity.
1,"Meaning in life: Accepting pointlessness? I know where I derive meaning in life. Stoicism is a tool to me to help me keep a level head to advance that meaning. I feel like I can apply it fairly well... Except on this one point. The lack of. 

To spare the details, fate has placed me in a position where I am unable to do what matters to me in life, and, in that front, continues beating me down before I can even get up and yanking from me what I believed to have been past success.

I want to make the best of my life according to what matters to me. Mortality and we can die tomorrow and all that, so make the most of it, eh? But I struggle to accept when fate won't allow me to. I feel empty, because the entirety of my meaning depends entirely on future, hypothetical probabilities - fate's hands, not mine. 

My life in its current state has no meaning outside of what is up for fate to decide *if* it wants to give me in the future. And that thought scares me. That that may never change to any significant extent. I can accept, in general, a lack of control in practically any other area, including my mortality, except for *this one thing*. Anything that influences my perceived level of meaning for living. *This* is my one weak spot. I don't care about living. But I do care about living rightly. Thus, lack of opportunity to do so hurts.

Could I shift my meaning to simply trying, to acting virtuously, and accepting the rest? Perhaps. But I find it hard to do so. Because what matters to me is getting a result. Doing that won't get me any more results, and knowing me, I fear may make me more apathetic towards my goals. Thus I am hesitant and would certainly struggle to make that shift.

I am ashamed to admit that following an event last night that once again punched me with meaninglessness, I got angry at life and partially let that out on someone. Does anyone have advice for acceptance here? Unless there's another route that I should take here?"

This is hard. 
I used to become angry but now whenever someone tries to anger me I think that is anger in this even necessary? And do I have control over the thing he/she is destroying or insult on just to make me angry.

Is this good way to deal with external events?

1,"Stocism and expectations (self motivation) From my understanding of stocism , stocism doesn't tshg3 expectations , cause must of the things in life are not under your control , you can effect your goals positively or negatively but you can't 100% accomplish your goals , and iam not talking about small goals that under your control , am talking about big goals like getting promotion at work , or succeeding in the academic path . So you can't associated something you can't control with meaning of good and bad , the questions if succeeding at University is not good or bad , so how can you motivate your self to actually do what's in your control ? Without the meaning of good and bad , without expectations ?
the thing is you can't motivate your self to do something big without the expectations that you have that you will succeed and it's going to work , otherwise why work hard if you are not sure that the outcome will be good ?"

He takes the same route to work everyday, arrives two hours before his starting time, goes to the bathroom at the same specific times, calls his wife multiple times throughout the day and has alot of particularly trivial niches . Yesterday while on lunch hour i sat in the canteen waiting for my meal to be ready, my colleague came in after me and immediately announced that I would need to leave that particular seat as it was his table, he then harrased me for a further few minutes to move from this particular seat, I refused and told him I would move simply when my meal was ready. I could see he became flustered and he immediately left the canteen to speak to his wife on the phone, an older colleague explained to me *insert colleagues name* has very peculiar tendencies and always has done.

1,"Stoicism for a Better Life - Weekly exercise (October 28) Hello there, 

For this week’s exercise, let us find some inspiration from Epictetus (who's teacher will be our inspiration next week). This is from the Enchiridion (not to be confused with Epictetus' Discourses) LI 2:

&gt;""...it depends on a single day and single action whether progress is to be lost or secured. ""  

All we have control over with 100% certainty is our judgments and thoughts in the present moment or the ""Here and Now"". We also know that we are only truly living (a big distinction from being alive) while we are engaged in the ""Here and Now"" with our rational minds (this is what some refer to as being mindful). Therefore our lives can be summed up in one single continuous sequence of present moments.

If we can truly accept the past as being in the past and out of our control and remain focused on our efforts right here and right now, then we can also accept that whatever we did in the past is meaningless as far as the goodness of our moral characters is concerned. Virtue is not found in the list of past accomplishments, but in our current efforts right now.  

**So as a practical exercise this week, try and live with a singular focus on your current efforts.** Don't think about what bad things you did earlier in the day or week. No matter how many bad choices you made in the past (right up to this present moment), you have the choice to be virtuous and make good decisions right now. Along the same lines, no matter how virtuous you may have been in the past, those are already done and gone. You cannot make ignoble choices right now, with the impunity of knowing you made ten good choices earlier in the day. **Each moment is a new opportunity to show our moral goodness and the way we show it is through our judgments and choices for actions in the present moment.**

I hope you find this exercise inspirational. If you feel like it, I would encourage you to share some of your experiences. It may very well help inspire others.

1,"Stoicism: Finding the balance between 'Carpe Diem' and ""Que Sera Sera"" This is my personal elevator speech when someone asks me about Stoicism. For those of you who don't know, ""Carpe Diem"" means seize the day(because it's all we have) and ""Que Sera Sera"" translates to ""whatever will be, will be"" in the romantic, latin based languages. ""C'est la vie"" is another good one. They may sound conflicting, but the balance between the two is where Stoicism lies.

Que Sera Sera is fundamental in understanding and practicing Stoicism. *""Don't demand that things happen as you wish, but wish that they happen as they do happen, and you will go on well.""* \- [Enchiridion 8](http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html) The future is going to happen. There will be bad weather, and good weather. There will be trials, as well as triumphs. Your loved ones will die. You will die. It is infinitely easier to accept reality as it is and learn to live with it, than waste energy assuming you control something that you do not. 

However, do not let an overabundance of ""It is what it is"" devolve you into fatalism and ""Life is pointless, why bother trying"", either. This is where Carpe Diem comes into play.

The only time we have is the present; the past has already happened, and the future hasn't happened yet. It may sound cliché, but this is one of the foundations of Stoicism. Marcus puts it nicely in [Meditations 2.14](https://lexundria.com/m_aur_med/2.14/lg): *"" \[...\] For a man cannot lose either the past or the future: for what a man has not, how can any one take this from him? \[...\] the longest liver and he who will die soonest lose just the same.""* We seize the day because it's all we have. [We do not exist to be idle](https://lexundria.com/m_aur_med/5.1/lg). We have duties, whether as a parent, a spouse, a neighbor, or just as a citizen of society. We study for that test, we work our ass off for that promotion, we exercise our body today because it may make the future better, and because the alternative is.. what? To lay in bed all day wallowing? 

However, do not get so excited about the possible future fruits of your present labors that you become upset when they do not turn out the way you wanted them to. This is where Que Sera Sera comes into play.

If it helps you to have something to whistle to yourself on the bad days, here's Doris Day's song, [Que Sera Sera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZbKHDPPrrc). Cheers."

I keep telling myself If I do develop chronic pain, I will want to kill myself and not have to suffer. As you can imagine, this is making me depressed. So my question is, how can I not be so attached to life and be okay with dying young? Because if I'm okay with dying, I won't have to worry so much.

1,"How to deal with an unusual and seemingly absurd attachment to someone I barely interact with anymore. To preface this, I’m a guy In in my junior year of high school. From 7th to the very beginning of 9th grade I was very close with this girl and would text her pretty much nonstop everyday. We also hung out a good amount of times but never did anything sexual because we were too scared and young. Looking back at it I’m probably romanticizing those times too much but I really thought I would be with this girl forever. However just as high school started she all the sudden started being distant because she was in another school and turns out she started talking to another guy. Eventually she transferred to my high school and she wanted to get back together, but I said no because I was still really angry and it was probably the right thing to do. This was two years ago, I still see her around school and occasionally snap her on Snapchat, we’re on good terms but lately I’ve been unhealthily obsessing over her and can’t seem to get over her, while she seems to have completely moved on a long time ago. I’ve been thinking about her more and more and I can’t get this feeling out of my head that things will never be as good as they were, because I’ll never be with her again, to top it off I just found out she’s moving and while it’s not too far I won’t get to see her at all in school, and a part of me is kind of relieved because I don’t have to be reminded what we had everytime I see her in the hallway, however it also confirms that I really will never to get back with this girl even though a part of me really wants to. I don’t know if this makes sense or if there’s something just really wrong with me but I’d like to get some insight from you guys. How would you deal with these thoughts and this situation."
1,This is a great read. 
1,"Just your daily reminder that pain is inevitable, suffering is a choice. Similarly, fear is inevitable, worrying is a choice.

1,"Is it weird that I’m really interested in stoicism at 18? I’m halfway through reading meditations and honestly I’m hooked, I’m so interested in stoicism and philosophy in general. I’m just wondering if I’m “weird” for being interested in this at 18 and if they’re any other people my age on here as well? I even have to hide the books from my parents because I don’t want them thinking I’m weird lol."
1,"Stoic practice is only a shadow of its theory. We can only become as close to “sage” as possible. I think the biggest misunderstanding of stoicism(as well as everything) is that theory can be directly translated into practice. When introduced to stoicism, many ppl actually think that is the case No. It takes time, effort, and real-life experience/adversity to react to, to learn how to act with virtue, and to develop a stoic mindset - to become familiar with the practice of the philosophy. Stoicism is not a button you can turn on/off. It will never become perfect. 

Like William O. Stevens puts it, ""Exercise Stoic virtues like patience, understanding, and cooperativeness, and flex them every day like they're muscles. Focus on your errors and think about correcting them.”

Bonus quote: ""It's silly to try to escape other people's faults. They are inescapable. Just try to escape your own.""

1,"Can I run this idea by you Stoics? Hey Stoics, new poster here and relatively new to Stoicism too but everything I've learned about it so far has changed my way of thinking and I'm starting to act differently so happy to be on this journey.

You seem like a good bunch of people with your heads screwed on that would give me your honest opinion so...

**Could I run an idea by you ?**

I have an idea which I'm tentatively calling ""Not Taught In School"" at the moment.

It was born from the idea that as you get older you realise there are so many skills you need in life that you just aren't taught in school (or by family or society in general).

Such as...

Money and finance skills, mindset and mental health, self learning and self improvement, preparedness and survival, relationship and social skills, entrepreneurship and creating wealth and so on (basically anything that constitutes a useful ""life skill"").

**And of course STOICISM.**

So my idea is simple...

To create a free weekly email newsletter that curates the best content that is teaching valuable life skills and lessons that most people wouldn't learn about elsewhere.

I'm already reading lots of websites around these topics and know who a lot of the top authors, bloggers and influencers are where as newcomers don't so I feel like I could curate a lot of useful content for them and save them a lot of time.

It would be a simple email round up highlighting the content and linking to it, sharing the general idea behind each piece of content, and with some additional commentary by myself sharing my thoughts and insights into the content and why it's worth reading / learning.

I know from my own experience it's too time consuming and overwhelming to keep up with all the different websites, blogs, YT channels and social influencers in one ""niche"" let alone several, so...

...the newsletter would aim to save you time and highlight only the most valuable and useful content that's actually worth reading in an internet filled with junk and spam.

Like I said above; it would be absolutely free to join and wouldn't be monetized initially but if it gained some traction then I may bring on sponsors / advertisers in future or scale it up into a full website.

However...

Before I spend too much time on this only to find there's not a great deal of interest then I'm looking to validate the idea.

Which is where you come in hopefully.

Based on what I've summarised above (and I know it's brief but all the details are not fleshed out yet and it'll be built on feedback from readers / interested readers)...

**Would you subscribe to the ""Not Taught In School"" newsletter?**

Even if you wouldn't personally subscribe...

**Do you think it would be a useful service for someone who's new to self improvement and just starting on their journey?**

Let me know what you think good or bad please Stoics. :)"
1,"Books for the beginner Stoic? Hey Stoics, despite the fact that I've been on the self improvement journey for many years, and studying / practicing everything from NLP to psychology to journaling to meditation to positive mindset and beyond, I'm still relatively new to Stoicism. 

I've even been aware of it for some time but never actually studied it until recently. 

I've bought Marcus Aurelius' Meditations but it's not an easy read to say the least .

But I've just finished reading ""The Little Book of Stoicism"" and now starting on ""The Daily Stoic"" (as well as being subscribed to the daily email list which has been great) and those seem good beginner friendly books.

Anything else the beginner Stoic be reading / learning from and putting into practice?

Thanks"
1,"My girlfriend of 2 years cheated and refuse to admit. She has been acting weird around our family friend, and I've decided to break up with her.

I look in my journal I stored in the basement and saw a message that they had sex in a car, even worse it looks like my dads hand writing as well so Idk, and he is kinda of a asshole so I wouldnt put it pass him.

I am torn; part of me know that I don't neither of the three parties and that I should just accept this , break up and move on with my life. but for some reason whenever I forget something remind me that it happenend.

Maybe I should stop and realize that I am disturbed by my lack of trust of her.

1,"A Difficult Decision I am happily married, and we have a young son. My in-laws are very involved in our lives. They are great people, they love my son, and we love them. My wife is going out of town this weekend (flying) and she told me that my MIL is writing up a letter for me to sign agreeing that, in the event of my wife’s death, they have visitation rights with their grandson. My MIL has somewhat of a precedent for this anxiety because of another situation. I also don’t share their family’s faith, which may be another factor in her thinking. Anyway, when my wife told me this, I felt offended and experienced strong anger. I understand that the anger is arising from the offense, and the offense from my desire to have control over what they think of me. I’m also assuming I know what they’re thinking. I don’t want these feelings to factor into my decision of what to do. I’d like to decline, and if pressed even refuse, to sign something like this because I don’t find it necessary and also don’t want to do something to limit my decision-making power in the future. But right now I know I’m not in the best state of mind to think this through clearly. Any wisdom?"

1,"Don't give away free trust to anyone Seneca the Younger's Letters from a Stoic explain in letter III:  

    Indeed, I would have you discuss everything with a friend; but first of all discuss the man himself. When friendship is settled, you must trust; before friendship is formed, you must pass judgment. Those persons indeed put last first and confound their duties, who, violating the rules of Theophrastus, judge a man after they have made him their friend, instead of making him their friend after they have judged him. Ponder for a long time whether you shall admit a given person to your friendship; but when you have decided to admit him, welcome him with all your heart and soul. Speak as boldly with him as with yourself."
1,"I was curious if I could make a day version fit. It should start at the day you're born but this is just a proof of concept, what do you guys think? (Sorry couldn't think of a clever quote) "
1,"Sometime ago I asked advice on to cope with post purchase anxiety. The answers helped me A few days ago I posted here looking for advice on a Stoic way of coping with over analysing, chasing perfection and doubting my choices. It was about having bought a car, and continuing to research afterwards (doubting whether or not I made the right decision). I bought it after some research and avoided certain options advised to me by a friend mechanic. As someone starting I needed a car that's reliable and cheap to keep running.

For those interested: It was about a punto (EVO). There's a proven 1.4 8V engine for it that's basically bulletproof, economical en easy and cheap to keep running and therefore advised to me. And there was the newer 0.9L twinair (yes a two cilinder). Although the reviews on the second are very good, as it's a really fun inspiring engine. It's nowhere as economical as they promise it to be, and needs special oil to run and keep running.

After having the car for a few days I wondered if I had made the right decision, went online to look for the same car but with a different engine and in the end even went to look at other cars. Only reinforcing my doubts about my purchase.

In hindsight, totally pointless and unfair to the car I had standing at my front door.

I received some really good advice about just being happy with whatever decision you make. Some people told me that I made my decision based on the information I had at the moment, and I did.

**Perfection just doesn't exist. If you're holding regret or uncertainty(anxiety) over a possession, you don't own it, it owns you.** u/taskforceslacker told me this

So I stopt looking around and just started enjoying the car. And now, I love that little brave machine. It's working for me now, and I like using it for what I bought it.

Sure there are faster cars around, sure there are better cars around. But at the moment, that car is the right one for me until the time comes for something else. I started owning it again, instead of it owning me."

1,"What is the meaning to life to a Stoic? And is it appropriate for a stoic to search for a meaning to life? 

“Virtue, and duty” come to mind as answers, but why virtue and why duty?

I think I have accepted that life is inherently meaningless, and this obscures my view of virtue and duty. 

This accepted truth, or better “perspective”, that life is meaningless is disenfranchising my motivation to live virtuously and dutifully. Because at the end of it, I ask myself, “if everything is meaningless, why does virtue and duty mean anything?” 

It is a destructive nihilistic mindset, and it makes me very afraid. I would like to find meaning in my life on a daily basis. But sometimes it is tough. 

Could anyone offer alternate perspectives on the matter? Thank you."

Stoics say that everyone is on loan from nature and that we should be grateful for the time we were allowed with our loved ones, not angry at nature for taking them back.

1,"I have this problem of unprocessed feelings? Dear community, 

I know this not r/relationshipadvice but from what I read there, I feel most advice there isn’t useful. 

Anyway, here my problem. 

I have wonderful partner. However, we haven’t seen us for long long time due to COVID-19 and Visa issues. This is not too much of an issue because we also have a company together and therefore spend much (virtual) time with each other despite the distance. 

I believe that her feelings for me a real but I find myself hyper sensitive to even the smallest things she does. Maybe it’s because we are also from very different cultures. 

I do think I am hyper sensitive because on a rational level, I see she’s providing me with much affirmation at times. E.g. sending me love songs etc. However, she is also very cold at times, which is normal for her. I know that.

I love that woman and I love the company and future we we building together. My question is now: do you have any practical advice how to control my hyper sensitive? 

I remember to be always very sensitive early on in relationships, yet it usually fades away with time as become certain of my partners love. Now we stuck in a LDR, and I find myself trapped in this early emotional stage of a relationship pregnant with (unreasonable &amp; unproductive) doubts. 

I am glad over practical input and trainings I can perform to work on me. 

Much appreciation"

I will take it to extremes and do lots of things to avoid going out - ordering groceries online, cancelling plans etc. 

Right so that mental health blurb out of the way. I want to push through the resistance and do it. Actually enjoy my mobility and the ability to step outdoors.

1,"Practicing Stoic - how do I deal with my lack of emotion to life? I have been a practicing Stoic for about a year and a half. I have read Marcus Aurelius, most of Seneca, Epictetus, and some modern Stoics like Ryan Holiday. 

I love Stoicism and I used to be a very emotional and scared person before it. 

I hardly get angry anymore or react to anything. When I am cut off in traffic I no longer react. I have found that things that used to trouble me for a long time now I get over quickly. 

The problem is that I now don't really feel anything at all. I think I have taken Stoicism to the extreme whereas I would like to be a Stoic like Seneca and be more human. Before there were more highs and lows but now it is mostly in the middle. I am never overly upset nor very happy. I guess that is a trade off. 

What do you guys think about this? How have you dealt with this? Do you accept this as a necessary evil, or do you have a method to introduce more highs in your life?"

I feel that I should write about this as is something I always was hoping to find and something I was unconsciously asking for. Before I continue my opinion on this, you might be asking: ""Who the hell is this guy whos writing this shit?"". Even I dont know who I am tbh. Thats why i want to write about the topic. This might be an opinion but to me it feel like a catharsis. 

Why do I think Memento Moir is good? I will stay why I, as a particular individual like this idea. Im on my early 20s. Im in college and I feel like im not doing anything fun/memorable/exiting or any ""cool"" thing, Im also not doing anything meaningful, anything that might help others. I procrastinate not only on my homework but on my life too. I always forget that there might not be a tomorrow and i forget what that im basically living like a maggot and i know there are many like me out there. 

Having this thing in front of you when you wake up and see how many weeks you MIGHT have left, it can wake the fuck up. Its not depressing, its reality. If looking at your life makes it depressing and scary then maybe that might be the problem in thy life.

I have read and watched many topics that say that reviewing your week every Sunday can boost your life a little. Many of us are starving for that ""little"" upgrade in our life. A book that i have read (Atomic Habits), said that [being 1% better each day](https://coryames.com/atomic-habits-james-clear/) can make you a better person. There are many things to do and Im sure you know what to do, therefore i will not write any. Having the Memento Moir reminds you to be 1% better. Maybe not 1%, but at least 0.5%. 

Personally i will do this: I will review each week every Sunday and i will give it a color, either green or red. Green if i think I did great in terms of the output i gave to the world. Red if i think I was bad. There should be red weeks and i think for a normal human  there will be more red than green but your goal is to have as many greens as possible.

DISCLAIMER: Outside influences will not be included in the performance like. Remember use your Stoic mindset to determine if you did well and dont use Capitalistic or 21th century ""performance"" measures. You are using this to analyze your well being and the output you give to the world. Again be Stoic and stoic in the judgment of the week. 

The goal is to feel better about yourself and see what have you done and why do you feel a certain way. Life is short and for us that are young, to forget that theres more to life that we are living right now is a sin."
1,"New here! Hello everyone!

Im new here! A couple of months ago I started to notice that the entire COVID quarantine started to affect me in a negative way. So I started to look for new ways of thinking and directions that could help me when times are difficult. And that’s how I learned about stoicism and it really appealed to me. So I wanted to learn more about stoicism and started reading the work of Marcus Aurelius. I bought ‘Meditations’ in English (which is not my native tongue) and I’m not going to deny it is quite a read. But still I learn valuable lessons and I try to apply them into my daily life. 

So now that I almost finished the book I thought ‘there’s probably is a subreddit for this’ and that’s how I got here. I wanted to ask how people here apply stoicism in their lives and how they benefit from it. I would love to hear from more experienced stoics. Oh and if anyone has some tips for good books, podcasts, movies etc about stoicism please let me know. Again, I would love to learn more about this philosophy😊

Thanks everyone!🙌🏼"
1,"Question on events outside of my control and where that distinction is Hi everyone - I’m relatively new to stoicism but one thing I see coming up a lot in texts I’ve been reading is the idea that when things fall outside of my control, and influence that I should focus on my own thoughts and actions and the response to the event, not to the event itself. 

My question is where does that line get drawn - I saw a modern day example of ‘if my train is delayed I have no control over that’ which is absolutely true for that train. But I could lobby the train company, write complaints etc. and then next time I would be content that I’d “done all I can beforehand” And it’s balancing that feeling of I’m not doing enough with being okay with it. 

Obviously I won’t write to the train companies, nor would I have time to take every example to extremis, and that’s the problem is there’s always a situation where I could have done more etc but has anyone found any solutions to this or ways of thinking about it?"
1,"Beyond death From stoic teachings we are taught to live beyond the shadow of death in order to live in the present and seeing how death is uncontrollable we are taught to accept it.

1,"With everything happening in the world, it's taking a toll on my mental health. What do I focus on? First off I apologize if I flaired this wrong, I don't post here too often. I also apologize if stoicism isn't the thing to turn to in this case.

I live in the US and everyone is so angry and divided these days. There are wildfires. The pandemic. Constant, relentless mudslinging. Climate change. I am afraid for my health and for my rights and for everyone else.

I am a firm believer in just... leaving people alone. Practicing the religion you want, and letting others do the same. Living your life by your own standards, and again, letting others do the same. As long as no one is getting hurt by your choices, what's the big deal? Be Christian, love your guns, be gay, do what makes you happy.

But it feels that no one believes that anymore. It feels to be all or nothing. There is no unity or common ground. No actions done for the best interest of people as a whole. 

I don't know what I should be caring about right now, and it's exhausting. I'm tired of being afraid, of being concerned about whether or not my legal status will be revoked or if I will no longer be able to afford healthcare or if the women in my life will have to go through things they never wanted to go through, or if the pandemic will end soon, or if the world will have clean air in 20 years. 

I'm constantly anxious these days. I have been practicing stoicism for a while now and can usually calm myself but I'm having a harder time lately. 

What is the right thing to focus on under stoicism? How can I stay calm?"

1,"how do i ""separate"" my life from my parents' life? i feel guilty and stressed. please read everything, it is a huge burden on my shoulders * my parents life was full of struggle and challenges 
* my life is better currently. i have food, shelter, money 
* i also have freedom to pursue a career, choose the kind of life i want to live which my mother didnot have (she was restricted by a super strict mother before marriage, married at 20, i was born when she was 21, lived alone in a rural city for 11 years after marriage \[third world\], struggled alone because father was working in another city). 
* my mother belonged to a nice family but due to the turn of fate she was married into a humble family with not much fortune. my father's family had ""social respect"" but respect alone does not pay your bills. my father had to put his blood and sweat and tears to create the wealth equal to what my mother's family owned and that is still not enough. their marriage was socially, financially, mentally a mismatch. 
* my mother was never allowed to think for herself. her mother always made her feel inferior, like a loser who must depend on her husband. my mother in turn also used these tricks on me to kill my self confidence because she must have seen her ""faults and weaknesses"" in me. 
* now i am adult, it took me long time to become ""sensible"". i remember vaguely that my parents were on the verge of divorce when i was in class 4 aged 8, father tried to asphyxiate me in bucket of water when i was 3 or 4, saw my mother crying a lot through my teenage. she used to say that her life was ruined, dreams were shattered, blamed me too. both parents threatened suicide regularly. on top of that, i was beaten a lot (i have understood the mindset of my mother and forgiven her completely). 
* we have been living a ""stable"" life at our home built with my father's tears since 2013. when we thought that life was finally better, father was diagnosed with cancer in 2019. he is in remission. 
* now i have a huge burden on my heart. of course i am to blame for everything. being a girl, i was a  liability on my father and i was born so soon that my mother herself was a young adult. i did ruin her life (in contrast, i don't want to have babies). 
* i cannot forgive myself. i feel like i don't have the right to enjoy my life. how can i be happy in my own life when my parents' life was ruined at my expense? i don't know why destiny tortured them like this. my mother was just like me in college when one day she was married off to my father and then life changed to what she had not even dreamt of. i get scared just by the thought of her misery and helplessness. just pure helplessness, no support from husband, no support from parents, no support from in laws. in 2004 my brother was born. just one day before the delivery, she travelled by herself on a rickshaw then overloaded taxi riding on damaged rural roads in the evening after her own work. her and i reached a better city where my uncle lived and she delivered my brother next morning. when i read about women saying how tough a pregnancy is then i remember my mother going to work, travelling alone and giving birth like that. it must have traumatized her. 
* i am evil to them. i should have died long back. i used to think that my parents were at fault for acting the way they did. now i realize that they were helpless and confused. in contrast, a lot of my family members lived happy prosperous lives. of course my mother would feel jealous. her fate did her wrong. 
* on the other hand, my father's fate is even unique. his 2 sisters, one young brother have all gone through deadly accidents and their bodies and faces are deformed. my father himself got oral cancer and his face is deformed. it feels like my grandmother's womb was sinful that she gave birth to children with such fates. 
* i hate myself when i am happy. i don't ever want to be happy. what if my fate goes bad? i was suicidal in the past months, especially late 2019. i don't know why i am alive. i am very confused. 
* this is my 100th time asking this question. i still don't have an answer. i feel like i want to hide myself and bury somewhere no one can find me. i am a culprit, a sin who destroyed my parents life and i will have to pay for my karma in my next life."
1,"Stoicism and God/gods/higher powers Hey all,

I started getting into stoicism about 2 months ago now as a way of deepening my connection with my truest self and those around me. In those two months I have primarily listened to stoic podcasts to and from work and while out driving for leisure. The four stoic virtues of courage, justice, wisdom, and temperance ring true to me; and find meaning and usefulness in the axioms spoken by the greats of the school of stoicism. 

However, I am a recovered acloholic/addict as well and i'm getting to the point in his sobriety where I would like to explore having a deeper relationship with some form of God/gods/higher power. In pursuit of this desire, I sought out guidance from someone who I look up to both in terms of their spirituality as well as their intellect. I began the conversation by expressing this desire and at some point along the way he mentioned journaling as an important part if his spiritual growth and development of a connection with God and the Universe (the term God is used in an agnostic sense here, neither of us subscribe to a particular religion). I agreed and brought up that I had, not too long ago, began studying stoic philosophy and that journaling was also a tool used by many stoics. He then told me that stoic beliefs and the idea of God did not necessarily align; that stoic thought is based primarily in the human will and the attempt to assert ones will upon the world. As someone who really does not know all too much about stoicism yet, I did not feel I could debate him, nor do I think that it would really do any good. However, I do know that there have been many misconceptions about the stoics over the millenia and i'm wondering if this is one of them. 

I would greatly appreciate any knowledge or experience you all have to share, especially if you have had similar experiences. I would also like to assert preemptively that I do not find intellect and a belief in some form of God/gods/higher power to be mutually exclusive. Thank you."
1,"An ethical loop? If someone does something bad they feel about it. They may then decide they are a bad person because if they were not then how could they do a bad thing?
Now the reason they feel bad is because it is the right thing to do to feel bad if you have done wrong but if you are doing the right thing does that not make you a good person?
So if you stop feeling bad that makes you bad because only a bad person would not feel bad for doing wrong.
But if you feel good that makes you bad because you should feel bad.

Does this make sense? Seems a loop a lot of people are stuck in."

1,"I’d like some advice on how to practice stoicism in racist situations I come from a family of right-wing Hindus and in India we are seeing unprecedented hate and racism towards the Muslim community and other minorities. While most of my family tend to muzzle themselves when I’m around, comments like ‘kill the b*stards’ or ‘get them out of the country’ aren’t uncommon. 
I despise discrimination of any kind and would not hesitate to call out someone who is badly behaved. However, with my family (parents included) this is a futile exercise and it really kills me to look the other way when they behave like this. What advise would you give me to help deal with these kind of situations? Talking or explaining why discrimination is wrong doesn’t go anywhere with them. There is a sense of entitlement and a deep sense of insecurity within the community that’s specially prevalent among the upper class Hindus.
I am looking of advise/practices that I could use to maintain my own sanity while dealing with such people."

One of the things I saw in the comments was that some of you would be interested in [purchasing one of the calendars](https://stoicreflections.com/), and others who would if it was a bit more affordable.

Having a bit of a background in spreadsheet programming, I made this [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bCQ0WJWIrwDP3ZnRRX2qcF97NVXXhiswz-gEdeUJwdU/copy) that does/can tell you the exact same thing.  All you need to do is input your birthdate into the cell next to the prompt, and the sheet does the rest.

&amp;#x200B;

I put the ""maximum"" at 80 and each box as a week, just like the calendar in the original post.  If you want to extend your copy's, all you have to do is insert columns after the one with the 80 (CD, and extend the range CD2:CD55 to those new columns.  Doing so will throw off the percentage at the top, so you'd need to account for the additional range there, too.

Privacy-wise: Since the link copies the sheet into your own Google Drive and there is no off-sheet database processing, the only security concerns involved are that which you share with Google.  I neither get nor want any personal information input."

I should have been dead, even before I was conscientious of myself. I don't want to forget it and I want to use it to fuel myself to the goals and to love the people I love. And so when the time comes I might embrace it.

1,"What is stoicisms view on organized religion? A friend and I were discussing where people would obtain a sense of morality and correct values.

I argued that my conscience can help me to determine what is moral and immoral. I think when a human does evil acts he feels guilt, as the soul suffers. So I think morality can be subjective, depending on the situation. 

He argued that morality cannot be subjective, it must be objective and defined by the word of god (he is Muslim, so through Islam). He said, if I don’t subscribe to rules of religion, be default I subscribe to the fluctuating opinions of society on what is right or wrong. 

What do you guys think about this. There are many religions, each claiming this is the correct way to connecting with God, however each have different processes of doing so. It is impossible to prove which one is the absolute truth, so why worry about it? I believe that our souls are divine and can connect to the God without any external institution, person, or material."

1,"Applying stoicism to conflicts at work, looking for advice because I´ve lost perspective. Hello, how are you all?

I´m trying to take stoicism to stressful conflicts at work because so far I´ve handled things really poorly. I´ve reacted and burnt many bridges, so to speak, and then I´ve let everyone step on me trying to avoid conflict.

So, please, do you have any advice on handling with difficult people at work? 
What do you think it´s the best stoic way? 

Lately, any time there was some mean or rude comment I was telling myself: ""do I really need to freak out over this? / Is there a real conflict here or is it just my ego? / if this person thinks I´m whatever, let´s look for the positive consequences of that"" and it started going very well, I was keeping my mood at work no matter what but then one day I exploded, not at work, but it was like I couldnt go to work anymore. I guess that instead of managing the situation I´ve been repressing my emotions?
Any suggestions, please? 

What I think it´d be great is to go throught the day no matter what, like if I just could not get affected by people being mean or rude or jerks in general, and then forget about it, not taking anything personally, not respond to anybody, if a coworker says something rude, dont let this affect me but be able to do the decent thing and not return the insults, for example, behave the ""virtuous way"" instead of creating more conflict.

1,"Hedonic Adaptation as a Drug I was wondering is there any discussion about hedonic adaptation as being like a drug?  It seems based on what I've read that a new car, new prestigious school, new clothing, new promotion give a very short term burst of euphoria that is short lived. And I'm wondering can this be compared to like a drug in the sense that like thousands of years ago drugs were not ubiquitous and all those new things that give euphoria are new too. And the problem to me seems to be that many of these things that are suppose to make us happy aren't really relevant or very loosely correlated to long term financial independence and long term social connections. I'm just thinking in terms of observing for example dogs. Like why buy a car unless there is someone to notice you having it. But a car won't force someone to be your life long friend. And like one can observe that there are animals like dogs that enjoy being petted so it seems to me the real problem is that most humans are designed to have a part of their happiness in close social connections. But the problem is that in the culture created by the capitalist system people are lacking reliable friends and so someone has to lose because relying only on family can't work (assuming they have a family) for everyone because just by probability someone will have something go wrong and be alone earlier than expected. So it seems to me that the focus on like winning at some basketball game to feel euphoria is like a grasp at getting attention in a world where very few are likely to give attention as a lifelong friend."

1,"Hard time moving on and forgiving family Hi!

I have a lot of anger, hate and resentment for my family. A lot of things has happend and continue to happen between me and family, to give you an example of the kind of shit I have to go through the times I meet them, 

• During one occasion my brother wrote in the family group chat about how he needed help regarding some work (it would take the whole day) and asked me and my brothers if we were available on a specific date. When I explained that I wouldn’t be available as I was working he wrote a long paragraph and started berating me that went something like this;

“You are worthless and untrustworthy. This is why nobody likes you and you have no friends. You never help the family...” etc. 

Nobody in the group said anything or called him out, they just accepted it. And when I brought it up they told be to suck it up and it’s okay because he is older. 

• I asked my sister why she had told private things I had told her in confidence to a third party. She started yelling at me and said that I don’t appreciate what she does for me until she stormed off.

• I returned my brothers car to him, which he had left at my mothers car. While in the car, the charger that he had left in the car was missing and he asked me where it was. I told him that I hadn’t driven the car and didn’t know. In response, he started yelling about how fucking tired he was of us and never listening to him while punching the cars glove compartment. It later turned out that the charger was in the glove
compartment of the car. 

This is just three occasions but it’s been like this my whole life (not just these two but from my other siblings as well) and continues today. It has resulted in me struggling with low self esteem much of my life, thinking I’m stupid, not lovable, always the one in the wrong and made me accept unfair treatment from others.
It has resulted in me not want to be around the family and avoid them, I just feel a lot of anger and resentment for them, but I still want to be close to my mother and father as much as I can since they are old. 

And I don’t know how to balance this, every time I am around my family I am on edge and nervous.

The healthiest I have felt in my life is when I wasn’t with the family or their influence ( especially my brothers)."

Recently I've gotten into Stoicism and Ryan Holiday mentions in his book The Obstacle Is The Way that he recommends the Inner Citadel by Pierre Hadot.

1,"Completed 60 Days of Meditation for 1 Hour/day and it cut my Anxiety away. I recently completed Naval Ravikant's recommended 60 days of meditation for 1 hour per day. I tried meditating before this for around 20/30 mins but never really felt that much benefit. So I started doing 1 hr. I tweeted about each day which kept me accountable and committed each day.

At first it was very difficult to sit still for that long. But after the first week, I started to truly realise that all of my problems were in my own head. I was perceiving things poorly, from past images that I'd clung onto.

Reading wisdom from the main 3 stoic philosophers, Jiddu Krishnamurti and Naval Ravikant each day also helped to rewire my mind, giving me useful stuff to meditate on. I now realise that living in the past causes depression and living in the future causes anxiety. Discovering for myself that this is true makes me almost unconsciously stay present - and I feel much better for it.

I am currently learning to code and as a practice project I made a meditation app that I am now using myself. It's based on doing 60 days of meditation, 1hr / day. At the beginning, only day 1 is unlocked. After meditating for at least 15 mins, the next day is unlocked. Each day has some advice/quotes from the philosophers I mentioned before.

Complete a 30 min session to be awarded 1 star, 45 mins for 2 stars and 60 or more for 3 stars. There are bonus unlockable Tao meditations for total stars and day streaks.

If anybody is interested in using this, I just put it on the play store. It's called ""60 Days of Meditation"".

I didn't attend the wound quite well. I went to work early and forgot to change bandages. This bothers me.

One year later (still don't know if this was the cause or that it was on my shoulder blade which stretches the spot) I still have a large and mostly everyday itching scar.

For you it might sound like something unimportant but for me it's a daily nuisance reminding me of my illness.

I try to invert this feeling into something useful. As a reminder of mindfulness (""oh there's a itch"" - and come back to the now) or as a reminder to now treat my body with the fullest respect because it reminds me that I didn't in the past. Maybe even as a memento mori because it is a part of a medical condition. Sometimes all of this doesn't work and I feel regret over my behavior.

But what would your stoic approach to this be?

1,"Getting blackmailed like a Stoic I have desided not to pay ransoms demanded by a hacker group which has hijacked very sensible information from a weakly protected system of a psychotherapy center (Vastaamo / Finland).

Here are my initial thoughts:

I will not take any responsibility from any harm that this may cause to anyone. I will not appoligise anyone at any reason caused by this event. I'm a victim of a crime and I should be treated accordingly.

I refuse to comment any information, which have been leaked out. Instead I have a right to feel beeing insulted and I will request polise to investigate if this person has violated any laws.

At first it appeared reasonable to pay - just to avoid problems in my life. But that would leave me worrying that these reports would be published anyway someday. The sooner I can face any consequences, the better. And what would be more humiliating than paying the ransoms and getting blackmailed again?

I believe that it will consume more time and energy to worry possible consequences that actually take the hit and deal with it.

I try not to consume my time and energy on any revenge fantasies. Instead I will invest some time and energy finding a way to forgiveness as soon as possible.

I feel that there is potential to turn this misfortune into victory. Instead of getting devastated and depressed, I will take this as a challenge. I will develope my abilities to keep moving forward while getting hit randomly. Instead of getting embarrashed, I will take this as a challenge to build character.

I believe that there is a way to handle this so that the outcome would be nothing, but a stronger version of me. This is a possibility to learn. This is an opportunity to personal growth. 

If leaked information will hit my human relationships so hard that this breaks my life, then I will build a new one. I have done that before and that's just life."

I have sort of bottomed out recently. This month has been conducive to the hardest times of some of the overall hardest times for my sons and me.



I have not studied (and certainly not practiced) Stoicism in earnest since the beginning of the month. It is usually a daily thing for me. I typically read and write a solid amount and find ways of implementing what I have been focusing on in my studies within our daily lives.



I, just today, found myself again immersed in this philosophy in a meaningful way. Today I have been doing a lot of reading and writing and had largely avoided addressing the subject of preparing for the loss of things I fear to lose. At first, I skirted the issue, telling myself that I had only my children left to really lose because I spend every day hustling and fighting and scrambling to ensure we have the bare necessities for the next day. ""Prepare for loss? Go with less of something on purpose? I don't have time to even consider such things since I am fighting with everything I have just to prevent those losses."" Plus, most of the time these types of lessons are worded in a way that says, ""prepare now, **while things are good**, for them to get worse"", and other variations on the same. In response to that wording, I have been focusing too much on how this is an unequivocally *not*  **good** time.



If I am real with myself, my family/household (3 sons 13 and under and me) could do well to add regular instances of practiced gratitude for what we *do* have, no matter the thing's steep price (not strictly financially) right now. We could definitely benefit from incorporating conversing and/or writing about anything at all that we are grateful for, but more substantially, we could significantly benefit from a regular **practice**.



My sons are 13, 8, and 2. I do understand that the 2-year-old needs to be considered carefully when implementing these practices, but I am also not thinking of anything extreme enough to cause any harm - just some annoyance and discomfort at first.



I am thinking of things like a night now and then where we pretend as if we do not have the luxury of having decent mattresses to sleep on, or no: hot water; electricity; wifi; TVs, tablets, phones, or  Amazon Echo with the Alexa assistant; spices/flavorful and diverse foods; access to excess toys; furniture; washer and dryer...and other little things that we are incredibly lucky to have access to today.



I think I would begin with the pretended loss of one thing at a time, as even one of those -- while not actually harmful -- could be a decent culture shock initially. My thinking is that Stoicism just has so incredibly much to offer when considered carefully and sincerely and put into regular practice. This type of practice specifically would not only help with being grateful, it would help actually prepare for the real possibility of having to go without one or more of these things that I have fought so hard for but that I have misguidedly allowed my sons to take for granted because I have been thinking along the time old way that people typically do not want their kids to ever have to face the types of realities/wants that they did growing up. 



I know that of course, they deserve all of these things and more to be provided for them as children who had no say in their coming into existence. Though, I want my sons to be so much stronger than I have ever been able to be. I want to avoid causing further trauma to them while building up their fortitude in healthy and productive ways. I want to help them by giving them the ability to deal well with the unexpected rather than spiraling as I’ve tended to do.



In my reasoning, not only would such implemented practices help strengthen their mental-emotional immune system when it comes to realizing how bad things could possibly get, but also how those things are not necessarily what's most important to have. I want them to be able to have time and opportunity and space created for them to flex their abilities to think critically and to look within themselves as well as to each other for sustenance pertaining to the ""soul"".



Putting such ""losses"" into practice and desensitizing them to things that seem utterly unthinkable now seem, to me, to have incredible potential for further familial bonding through getting creative and experiencing such significant events as a team. It seems like it would build new and strengthen established lines of trust. Maybe it could bring out individual and group character traits involving rising up to take the lead in diverse situations, instilling in each of us a better understanding of our points of power and perhaps make us aware of certain weaknesses that we might not otherwise know to exist until it is too late to reach inward to evaluate, analyze, and plan for the betterment of. 



One of the biggest things I focus on as a parent is open and honest, effective communication. With this practice, I think that in addition to everything I have just laid out my thought processes on, communication between us as a whole would benefit greatly."

1,"The Four Treasures of Stoicism - What are the rewards of Philosophy?  **“Virtue may be defined as a habit of mind in harmony with reason and the order of nature. It has four parts: wisdom, justice, courage, temperance.”** \- Cicero (as quoted by Wikipedia)

With this you should be familiar already. Often it is said that virtue is practiced for its own sake, or its own reward, but all I will add is that there are indeed rewards obtained from the practice. That is why I call them the Four Treasures as opposed to the Virtues because they are rewards we can obtain, not just character traits to develop. They are valued and desired by everyone, but the path to get them is only crossed by the philosopher.

**Wisdom begets the Treasure of Autonomy.**

&gt;As a wise and prudent person, you don't need to shepherded by holy men or tyrants. All you need to steer your life is with you at all times, from nature and experience, with an independent mind. You produce your own philosophy instead of relying on the account of others.

**Justice brings the Treasure of Prosperity.**

&gt;Only a just and fair man can have friends, family, and success in all business endeavours. Society flourishes under the rule of such individuals. 

**Courage gives rise to the Treasure of Freedom.**

&gt;No one is a slave to anything but fear itself. If you can defy fear and stand against it, no master can make you tremble. Only courage can break the chains that bind you to your station.

**Temperance produces the Treasure of Sanity.**

1,"Nietzsche's attack on Stoicism I've been reading Nietzsche's *Beyond Good &amp; Evil*, and came across a chapter addressing Stoicism, that I thought might be interesting to share and discuss:

&amp;#x200B;

You want to *live* 'according to nature'? O you noble Stoics, what fradulent words! Think of a being such as nature is, prodigal beyond measure, indifferent beyond measure, without aims or intentions, without mercy or justice, at once fruitful and barren and uncertain; think of indifference itself as a power - how *could* you live according to such indifference?

To live - is that not precisely wanting to be other than this nature? Is living not valuating, preferring, being unjust, being limited, wanting to be different? And even if your imperative 'live according to nature' meant at bottom the same thing as 'live according to life' - how could you *not* do that?

Why make a principle of what you yourselves are and must be?

The truth of it is, however, quite different: while you rapturously pose as deriving the canon of your lwa from nature, you want something quite the reverse of that, you strange actors and self-deceivers!

Your pride wants to prescribe your morality, your ideal, to nature, yes to nature itself, and incorporate them in it; you demand that nature should be nature 'according to the Stoics' and would like to make all existence exist only after your own image - as a tremendous eternal glorification and universalisation of Stoicism!

All your love of truth not-withstanding, you have compelled yourselves for so long and with such persistence, and hypnotic ridigity to view nature *falsely*, namely Stoically, you are no longer capable of viewing it any other way - and some abysmal arrogance infects you at last with the Bedlamite hope that, *because* you know how to tyrannise over yourselves - Stoicism is self-tyranny - nature too can be tyrannised over: for is the Stoic not a *piece* of nature?

But this is an old and never-ending story: what formerly happened with the Stoics still happens today as soon as a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always creates the world in its own image, it cannot do otherwise; philosophy is this tyrannical drive itself, the most spiritual will to power, to 'creation of the world', to *causa prima*.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Personally, I can understand his argument regarding the imperative of ""live according to nature"", as Stoicism revolves around suppressing negative emotions, thoughts and feelings, which are, at the end of the day, natural inclinations.  


I disagree with the part about Stoics trying to make all existence after their own image. I think Stoicism is very personal and practical, and advocates not trying to force your beliefs onto others (theres a quotation from Senenca about neither hating nor imitating the world - but just trying to be your own person)."

1,"I was cut out of my friend's lives a year ago because of something I did that I'm not proud of. It feels like they've died. How would a stoic handle this? Just over a year ago I did something I'm not proud of. I won't get into it, but turns out I'm an addict and it spiraled out of control. My family found out, my friends found out and my wife found out as I was humiliated publicly on social media for what I did. My life was turned upside down and I don't wish it upon anyone.

I lost friends I had for over 25 years. These were guys that were in my wedding. Since then they haven't reached out, and one of them (my best man) revoked my wedding invitation. They haven't spoken to me since. My wife and family told me that if they were there when things were easy and immediately headed for the exit when things went to shit, they weren't true friends. 

I feel like they've died. I cried and mourned for months. It felt like a part of my identity was shattered.

Fast forward a year later, my wife and family have stuck by my side. I've received professional help and have been in recovery since. It has not been easy by any means, but I'm still going day by day and managing the best I can for myself and my family. I have reconnected with old friends and made a couple new friends, but it's not the same. The relationships I had with those guys - or so I thought - felt like home.

How would you guys / a stoic handle this situation? I still have dreams multiple nights a week about seeing them and hanging out with them. I just don't know what to do. Any advice at all to help change my perspective or help in general would be so appreciated."
1,"""A man's merits can never compensate for his faults"" - Machiavelli (Discourses on Livy) inb4 jokes on you, I have no merit posts. lol 

For those who read Machiavelli in the pass or are only familiar with  his much more famous short book ""the prince"", you may be interested in checking out his other work on the best way to govern men and conduct the affairs of society.  

Lots of stoicism buried in the pages and this work comes off much better. I understand the ""the prince"" was basically a giant job application for the author seeking the employment of the Medici family patriarch. Within this context, it places the prince in better light but still falls short compared to this other more comprehensive work.  

He pretty much was a fanboy of Rome but goes to great lengths analyzing the good and bad decisions they made througout their history.  If you a fan of Rome, must read, and if your a philosopher king then should read."

1,"Schools need to more Stoic in their approach to education. The education system we have now is all about promoting success for the individual. There is so much focus on doing a good job at every single assignment, far more than about teaching moral values. They have insane things like ""honour roll"" and the relationships between students are highly insecure. Kids are desperate to be popular because their teachers don't give them the emotional fulfillment they need.

What is it going to get them? How much are you going to care about the good grades you got all those years ago? How much will your parents and teachers care? Do your employers care? Is there no option for an adult who didn't do a good job?

Success comes from your own standards, not from the first letter of the alphabet on a piece of paper, and we need to start teaching this."
1,"Should I move? I am graduating high school in the middle of November. Soon after, I will be staying at my dads house interstate for a month, then, I will decide whether I wish to live with him or stay where I am. I have to decide before January whether I shall move or not because I plan to study at Tafe (Technical and further education institution) to which I must entroll by January. So I must know where I want to live so I can enrol into the appropriate Tafe, and I believe it will begin in March or something. 

I wish to move because I prefer where my dad lives (which is where I grew up, and lived before my parents split), because I don’t have the best relationship with my mum or her partner. Although it has been getting better lately, I also struggle because my mum has a baby and a toddler with her boyfriend. The house is always really noisy, and there are regular dramas (often between my mums partner and my 13 year old brother. I do like this city, and I have made a couple of friends which I do value, however I prefer my old city, not only because the rest of my family lives there but I generally prefer the city itself. 

Earlier on I was very keen to move. But now, I am a little unsure because I will miss my friends and my siblings and mother. Though, I do realise that not matter what choice we make in life we must sacrifice something and it’s about what we wish to sacrifice in order to reach a certain end. I find myself thinking about it when I should be focusing about the present. But I try to picture if I will be happier living with my dad to staying here. If I wish to stay here, I’ll have to put up with the challenges at the household and not seeing my family until I can afford to move out, which houses aren’t cheap here so i would need a full time job in order to rent somewhere which won’t happen anytime soon.  

Do you have any advice about this?"
1,"Teenager Confused About How I'm Feeling Male, 18, been following stoic practices for a while and this year my life has seen great change from shifting my mindset in many ways. I do journal and exersise and do all the basic 'sharpening the saw' activities. My queries are numbered so it helps discern where they start and end :)

**1)** However, after a few weeks of grinding, be it school, work, body or learning things etc. I always end up with some kind of mental blockages. A few months ago I started obsessing over my body and flaws, then later on I became a little paranoid about how much I know compared to my peers and as of late, I cannot get over this weird FOMO I have. 

**2)** I ran into friends from my old school the other day and this might have furthered these feelings. I don't really hang out with people and the last good, real friends I had were these bunch of boys from my old high school. It's been almost two years since we went to school together but I still love them and seeing them was nice. The FOMO is more to do with maybe seeing this place n a book of video, then thinking about how nice it would be if I could take the girl I love or even the boys to this place and just be humans together. Specifically that small fantasy has been crossing my mind lately.

**3)** I don't time on social media but lately my YouTube consumption has gotten a bit worse and it kind of happened in the background without my knowledge. Before I knew it, it's been two weeks of consuming YouTube morning and night, right around my sleeping times which can't be good for me. This further intensifies these feelings as I see all these people online that I connect with and whom I'd love to be friends with. For example the other day I watched Joe Rogans conversation with Matthew McConaughey and I really felt like wow, what a great man, wish I was friends with him!

**4)** On top of this, recently I started work (as in a part-time job) and it's become a new challenge to complete school work and exercise and do all those things. Especially exercise I've been slacking just this past week.

If you read this far thank you. Perhaps I just need to journal more, I haven't written in my journal for the past two days. But journaling only helps get my feelings on the page, but still leaves me confused on how to solve them.

1,"How to deal with father punishing me with silent treatment First of all, I don't wish to get political, so apologies if this post is taken the wrong way. I'm a beginner to stoicism.

To cut a very long story short, my father and I disagree on COVID restrictions. He believes I am acting ""selfishly"" by not doing things such as washing hands, avoiding social contact, etc. He has always been extremely forward about his political beliefs, has trouble with opposing viewpoints.

He has exploded in anger at me a few times over the months, and I manage to defuse the situation. I prefer to maintain a ""live and let live"" approach, i.e. he is entitled to his views, and I am entitled to mine. I think he manages to repress his anger most of the time but once in a while it bubbles out and an argument seems on the horizon. Since this pandemic began and we disagreed, although I managed to avoid arguments, he seems to be somewhat resentful and his previous genuine affection for me has dissipated. If I didn't make an effort to talk to him we could go weeks without talking, he is uninterested and aloof around me. I questioned him over this and he said there is a ""rift"" between us regarding COVID and began to initiate the familiar ""You're not doing enough for the family"" spiel.

I managed to escape to process my thoughts, went for a walk, and came back to him glued to the TV, indifferent. It didn't used to be like this, but 6 months later, I am trying to come to terms with the fact that this behaviour might not change. How do I deal with this situation in a stoic way? It pains me to think he doesn't care any more, so I am trying to accept it. We have drifted apart, the subconscious genuine affection has gone."

1,"Whenever you find yourself upset, pay close attention to what false appearance/expectation you had that led to the discomfort. This is how you grow as a Stoic. Stoics believe that every distress that we encounter, however minor or major, is caused by a poor expectation or assumption that we made. To become unconquerable, then, is to forsake the perceptions that society teaches you, to not assume that a person will act in such a way, and to not make any expectations about what the future holds. This is how Socrates openly welcomed a death sentence. This is how Epictetus dealt with being enslaved and crippled with such equanimity. This is how a Stoic becomes invincible. 

Upset that you broke your leg? Did you expect your leg to be unbreakable? Why are you so convinced that a broken leg is a bad thing? 

Angry that you lost your job? Why did you assume that it was in your power to keep it? You do not control the economy, the industry you work in, or your boss, so why did you think you controlled whether or not you stayed employed there?

Sad that a loved one died? Who told you that they would live forever? How could you not see it coming? For everyone and everything dies eventually. 

I should add that it is okay, and natural to *feel* things when things happen. What I am talking about here is you ruminating, dwelling, wallowing, and otherwise playing the ""woe is me"" card for days on end. ***Feeling*** **an emotion is a natural, momentary, human response that is more or less inevitable.** ***Thinking*** **an emotion is an intentional choice, and oftentimes an unnecessary reaction to something after the initial feeling has subsided.**

**Tl;dr**: False perceptions and assumptions of control over things you do not will necessarily lead to disappointment and distress. The faster you can assimilate reality instead of thinking you can change it, the happier you will be."

1,"This is your life and it’s ending one minute at a time - Tyler Durden Hi!

I was studying some things and this quote popped into my head and thought, hmm kind of stoic. I’m reading a guide to the good life and in the first chapter the author talks about hedonic adaptation, negative visualization and how we take things for granted. 

Well, I think that quote goes hand in hand with that thought. One of the exercises of negative visualization is realizing you could die in a moment, and that most of the time because we don’t acknowledge that we just idle and lose a lot of time. 

Realize that, this is your life and it’s ending one minute at a time."
1,"How to Understand Evil 
Whenever you see somebody do something hurtful, negative, cruel or evil to another or yourself always remember this:

No one is born as simply good. Everyone, without exception, has the capacity to commit the greatest evil. Similarly, everyone has the capacity to commit the greatest good. 

Evil, by its very nature, comes easy and natural. We are born as an individual and thus instinctively seek to maintain our self-preservation and our own self-interest. It is only when we interact with others, begin to form bonds and relationships outside ourselves, we begin to learn that humans can live for each other. Some are not fortunate to be able to learn this and so are still driven by their basic instinct of self-interest.

In the same way we have to learn to work and connect with others, we must constantly work towards the good. Being good, being kind requires forethought, intention and effort. And sometimes for every good act, there may be multiple evil acts which occur. 

So do not consider yourself better than your fellow human because you are doing good. You are simply more experienced, more learned and even then you still constantly make mistakes."

1,"Is there another piece to the equation? Stoicism doesn't seem to lead to self-actualization. Hi,

I would expect that most of us are familiar with Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.  Here is a nice article if not: [http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/maslow.html](http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/maslow.html)

The pyramid suggests that we have basic needs of food, water, and security and then psychological needs for belongingness and esteem.  Maslow categorized these needs as ""D-Needs"".  If we didn't have these things, we would feel their deficiency.

The apex and fifth layer of the traditional pyramid says that after our D-Needs are mostly satisfied, then we strive for self-actualization. Once you start to ""feed"" self-actualization, once you start to realize it, then the more that you crave it.  The idea of self-actualization is that, ""What a man can be, he must be.""

In my view, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is directionally accurate.  Meaning, he's mostly right.  That's mostly the order that most people experience life, making exceptions that people in their individual life's can jump around the layers to an extent.  

Which then leads to Stoicism. Stoicism is appealing because it provides a logical framework to address life.  I am going to extremely simplify it. 

1. What is your ultimate purpose?  Harmony with nature, pursuit of virtue/excellence/arete, etc.
2. Is your passion or desire in line with your purpose? We exercise control of our passions. 
3. Are your thoughts, beliefs, and value judgments virtuous or vicious? 

You apply this framework systematically across your life, meditating on what is virtuous and motivating yourself towards virtuous action. How can I be a better husband, father, co worker, and citizen of the cosmos?  While in theory your action towards being a better citizen of the cosmos may lead to self-actualization, I am not sure that Stoicism really embraces that concept.  In other words, Stoicism is about being content with regards to your ""D-Needs"", as Maslow says, but not specifically about self-actualization. 

What about those passions that lead to self-actualization that are virtuous but out of your control? True entrepreneurs have a driving passion to create a business despite many of the factors for success being almost completely out of their control. People have a drive to lead, manage and coach others, not out of a sense of ego or pride, but because they truly have that ""calling"" within themselves to help better other people.  People have ""callings"" towards serving country or being a police officer.  Are these passions that should be controlled?  Are these not healthy drives towards self-actualization? 

Has anyone found a combination of Stoicism to satisfy your ""D-Needs"" and something else to help define our need for self-actualization?  Are how has Stoicism helped you self-actualize?

I appreciate your thoughts."

1,"Finished Meditations and there's something that's bugging me about stoicism in general One of the major takeaways for me was that our current lives are essentially blips that will mean nothing in the vastness of time. Even people with famous legacies are eventually forgotten completely, etc. So, why does it matter that we are stoic? Let's say we're neurotic and bugged out and panicking for large portions of our lives, is that really worse than living a stoic life? Ultimately we become dirt. So why bother focusing so much energy on living in a particular way?"
1,"Friends and other relationships. I just cut another friend out of my life and I am wondering if this was the right thing to do. I determined a girl that I was seeing was not being truthful and was confiding in a friend about this negative experience. The friend, being my ex, said some things to say about ""getting what I deserve"" and it really rattled me. I would not consider anyone who gains pleasure out of my misfortune  my friend and I decided to stop talking to her.

My question is on friends... What standard to have for friends? Should we be able to interact normally with people who don't meet those standards? Should I have ended this friendship... Was i wrong to confide in an ex about another relationship... Or rather should I give this person more latitude because of our history?"

If—  BY RUDYARD KIPLING

If you can keep your head when all about you   
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
    But make allowance for their doubting too;   
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;   
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;   
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
    And treat those two impostors just the same;   
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
    And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,   
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
    If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,   
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,   
    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!"
1,"I find myself obsessive over negative thoughts/past experiences daily 
I find myself thinking about negative past experiences, what I could have changed, how people perceive me. Daily. Lots of times.

I catch myself and think, why are you still thinking about this thing that happened YEARS ago. MOVE ON! Be happy and present.

But the loop continues. 

Do I need to accept that I will never be able to erase these thoughts? It isn’t like someone can go into my brain and select this and this then move to trash. 

If so, how exactly do I live with these? How do I make peace with them? How do I forgive myself and others? How do I just live for today and try the best I can in life?

I meditate every day and keep a healthy routine but I struggle with this still.

I’ve got so much going for me but I’m stuck in this identity of who I was in the past and the bad experiences. I’m not that person but I can’t break out of it.

Because Reddit is more anonymous, you dont get that level of aggression regarding status. At least not that I've seen. People are much more chill. Certainly I don't feel the same association between posting and receiving up votes as I would on other social media where reputation is at stake.

I would say that when you get to the point that you...

Then you'll you'll discover quite quickly how extraordinary a life was meant to be, could be  


And it's, it's just we get so messy,   
it's not that we are doing lots of wrong things,   
our mind is so messy  
We don't keep it simple  
And we end up making the life that we are living, so in-ordinarily complicated  
Completely unnecessarily, and it's such a shame to end up feeling, in a real muddle, while actually, you ought to be having the time of your lives  


It doesn't actually take very much to make the deepest part of us incredibly happy

To be in touch with your heart

And then above that, it takes mindfulness and virtue, to come to a fortunate human life

The invitation is not to show how inventive and imaginative you are  
But how much you can notice what you're already part of  
And appreciate it and share it, and care about those that are around who count for their welfare while you are looking out for your own, that's it  
And then you'll get to the end of it, having had an awesome time  
Knowing, that that is something you'd recommend to others  
Ah

You already know this place inside, where it's alright  
You all know that when you let the ego go, it's not this black hole that you jump into

You came here with a sense of awe and wonder, dying to just see what it's about  
You know, it's like, what would it be like?  
To be down there?  
To be part of it?  
And you came here with a sense of wonder, and somehow the wonder of it wasn't enough and we stopped wondering and started to wonder about ourselves  
And in your wondering about yourself, you forgot what you came here for, what you came to be a part of"

1,which principles of stoicism are misconstrued by most? 
1,"Living every day as if it were your last doesn't seem like a good idea I'm confused by the ""live every day as if it were your last"" advice. If this were my last day and I knew it, I would give a lot of my stuff away, eat too much, drink too much, not go to work, maybe throw a party, definitely not bother to floss. It seems like a recipe for a self-destructive and imprudent life.

I'm assuming that this is a misinterpretation. The stoic philosophers were smart people, and they didn't generally live in an imprudent and self-destructive manner - quite the opposite.

So how do I interpret this advice in a way that makes more sense?"

Since I have been practicing and studying Stoicism I have found myself looking closer at people and their personality, decisions, actions etc. I am a huge fan of MMA and one of my all time favorite fighters Khabib Nurmagomedov who is currently 28-0 is fighting another great fighter this weekend named Justin Gaethje. The reason I am bringing this up is over the years I have found myself seeing so much of what I view as Stoicism in Khabib and how he handles fame, adversity, loss and more. 

He is committed to his religion, principles and what he feels is right. He is also not afraid to speak up if he believes something is wrong. He seems to be dealing with the loss of his father in away that I believe is quite Stoic. Continuing on with his legacy knowing his father would want that and from what it seems not allowing it to affect his drive but rather fueling it! He seems quite calm during the lead up to his fights and in the cage! Honestly there are many examples of this and I’m leaving a lot out. There are obviously times when he did not make the best choices such as jumping over the cage etc. but overall I see him as one of the most Stoic athletes I’ve seen in my 33 years.

Also she or more so was very materialistic with a trend in past to use ""richer men"" (im not rich just a good salary).  With me shes been good as of late no real materialism or any drama and really trying to be good with me.  She said shes tired of what she thought she wanted after she broke up with her simple ex and just went on a free for all.  But she just wants a boyfriend she really loves and that she wants to change and shes unhappy and sad and really likes me and says I don't accept her or see her ""as wife material"" because of her past.  I am no angel either, but my ideal was to find a girl who maybe was more of ""good girl"".  I know this is maybe not place ask for advice.

I could get behind the isolation and lockdown when I lived with my friends and family, it made sense. Nobody really NEEDS to go out, we can all stay indoors and ride out this pandemic. 

But in the midst of this crisis I moved across the country for graduate school (which switched to all-online after I moved...) And now I don't live with my support group. Since school isn't in person, I have no common space to meet people and form relationships. Hence the isolation induced depression. Everytime I think things are starting to get better I hear more bad news, cases on the rise and therefore more cancelled things. 

I can't put up with being isolated for much longer. I know being anti-quarantine is a super unpopular opinion but this isnt living. I spend an average of 22 hours a day in a 10ftx10ft box. I'd rather just get the virus and live or die then move on, but the worst part is I wouldn't just be affecting myself it could potentially affect someone else too. If I could make that decision just for myself I would in a heartbeat, but I seem to be the only one who thinks this around here."

1,"Advice needed I have a friend who is going through a lot, and I'm trying to figure out how to best give advice that will best help him. I have always found that the stoic line of thinking offers some of the best guidance.

The situation is as follows: My friend has asked for a separation from his wife whom he has two children with. He has PTSD and is living from couch to couch and in his vehicle. He explained that he is simply not happy, dinner is never made when he gets home from work, sometimes being gone for a week at a time, and the house is always dirty. Granted, his wife works full time and is doing an online college program working towards a doctorates and that's no easy task let alone with two kids. He says something just snapped in him and he stopped caring. He refuses to see anyone to get help for his PTSD, and is drinking heavily lately. He has not actually told me anything about the situation, everything I have gathered is through other friends and his family, and we have been best friends for years so I don't understand why he hasn't reached out. We are supposed to be meeting up later this weekend, and I want to be prepared on how to best guide him so he does not fall into a hole that he will spend years in. If I can't convince him to maybe work on things with his wife, then I'd like do what I can to help him through the process of separation and how to best handle everything , because right now he is simply not.

**Question:** I have a deaf brother and two deaf parents but I can hear. Sometimes I am keenly aware of how isolating it is to be deaf. It saddens me that they are excluded from the experience of hearing and the benefits that come from being able to hear (namely, social - deaf people are oftentimes restricted to quality connections with other deaf people - blind people are arguably not as isolated), despite the fact that they try their best in life and seem more or less happy. They are solid and strong people and always wanted the best for me.
 
I think deep down I always felt guilty about this growing up. For instance, I do not think my brother has much of a social life (introvert, always on the computer), and so when I return home from social events, I feel guilty and feel like I will need to take care of them. And I do, I look out for them. But I wonder about these things in a way that makes me suffer inside needlessly. 
 
Please help me see my situation in a better light.


**Answer:** Speaking as an introvert with a very social family, I find that their concerns regarding my isolation to be mostly fictitious. I have fewer friends than the average person, but I do not suffer from the desire for a plethora of friends, as an extrovert would. Thus, my family views me unfortunate for my lack of connections, and I feel fortunate for the few good people I do have near to me. It is wise that you have structured your statement thus “I do not think my brother has much of a social life”, have you considered that communication is far easier with those online? And that he is differently treated when he leaves the house? Many people try to help or be empathetic to those with disabilities, but those with disabilities typically just want to be treated as normal individuals. Online spaces eliminate social problems like this, people are not judged upon their abilities or appearances, it simplifies a task that is difficult for many people. And who are we to say that these connections are not as real as the connections built in real life?

You have also not considered that the curse of deafness is only apparent to those who can hear or who did hear, you are saddened that they cannot hear because you can hear. If they have not had this experience, then how are they to mourn something they have not lost in the first place? Would you mourn that you shall never see a flower, having never seen a flower? It is they who have all that may lose all, the more one possesses, the more subject to loss he is. Shall you weep for a man that shall never lose his sight? Then do not weep for your family, for they cannot have lost what they did not have. If I am mistaken, and one or more of them had sight at one point, tell me who told you that you were entitled to keep your sensing faculties for all your life? Do you not see elders deteriorating? Do you not see their minds becoming slower? Their limbs frail? Their eyes darken? What in life guarantees a man that he should not lose his senses? Will you live your whole life not considered that your eyes shall not be taken? Your legs? Your arms? Shall you engage in a world of various dangers and not consider the possibility of loss?

There is little in life that cannot be seized from you by fortune, for what fortune gives, it has a habit of taking back eventually. Your body is subject to fate, as is your mind. There are no guarantees against reckless drivers who cripple you, or freak accidents which leave you mentally handicapped. So if you place great value in your ability to run, becoming crippled shall be all the more difficult, and if you place great value in anything else, that may be taken from you, then you shall be all the more grieved should it be taken. You must view people and things as transitory, your family shall be gone one day, and there is a chance you shall not be alive to see it. These appear as terrible things, horrible realities which plague us, but they are not. Those who accept reality on its own terms live better lives, and waste less time, for we who know the nature of life do not procrastinate that which is most important. As Epictetus said,

&gt;*“The will of nature may be learned from those things in which we don't distinguish from each other. For example, when our neighbor's boy breaks a cup, or the like, we are presently ready to say, ""These things will happen."" Be assured, then, that when your own cup likewise is broken, you ought to be affected just as when another's cup was broken. Apply this in like manner to greater things. Is the child or wife of another dead? There is no one who would not say, ""This is a human accident."" but if anyone's own child happens to die, it is presently, ""Alas I how wretched am I!"" But it should be remembered how we are affected in hearing the same thing concerning others.”*

Nothing is guaranteed by fortune except this; that you are able to choose how to react to fortune. Fortune may take your money, your home, your family, but it is your choice how you may treat these grievances, it is within your ability to accept these and move on. It is within your ability to be greatly insulted and feel no hatred for the insulter. You are ever the master of your choices and actions, and should you not surrender your intentions and actions to the whims of emotion, you shall be free and at peace with all happenings.

Your family is not deprived of anything that makes a life worth living, for would it not be a cruel world in which to live if one must be able to hear or see or smell to have a good life? We mourn all those who shall never see the sun rise or set, yet they cannot mourn this with the same acuteness that we can, for we have seen the beauty of the sun, and understand better what others have been deprived of. Yet you treat these senses as though they were all that life is made of, and you forget the joy brought by another person's love, the tender caress of someone close to you, the excitement of achievement, especially against something as difficult as a disability. You forget that there are those who live life deprived of family, of love, of joy, of camaraderie, yet it is your choice to weep for the hearing of your family instead of celebrating the many gifts they have. Every man, no matter how plagued by difficulties, has some good fortune afforded to him. So if one chooses to mourn his losses he must also proportionately care for what he does have while it is not yet lost to him. He must view every possession with equal fervor, and in seeing these things depart from him, he must recall that these things have not fully left him, as their impression remains upon him. As Seneca says,

&gt;*“Has it then all been for nothing that you have had such a friend? During so many years, amid such close associations, after such intimate communion of personal interests, has nothing been accomplished? Do you bury friendship along with a friend? And why lament having lost him, if it be of no avail to have possessed him? **Believe me, a great part of those we have loved, though chance has removed their persons, still abides with us.** The past is ours, and there is nothing more secure for us than that which has been.”*

We are formed by those around us, and the loss of them sweetens the memories of them, what can be taken from us that we cannot be more grateful for in retrospect? And what would that thing be if could not have been taken? Does not the passing nature of things also make them sweeter and more dear to us? Does not the transitory nature of that which surrounds us make us more careful about how we use our limited time? Is there anything which you would treasure if it was yours for a thousand years? No. Possession of something for a long time dulls us to it, and it is the loss of that which we have had for so long which rekindles our passion for it, and reminds us that we are not guaranteed anything, reminds us that we ought to care for things now, not later. As Epictetus states in Discourses 3:24,

&gt; *“As to something brittle as glass or earthenware; that when it happens to be broken, you may not lose your self-command. So here, too, when you embrace your child, or your brother, or your friend, never yield yourself wholly to the fair semblance, nor let the passion pass into excess; but curb it, restrain it, - like those who stand behind triumphant victors, and remind them that they are men. Do you likewise remind yourself that you love what is mortal; that you love what is not your own. It is allowed you for the present, not irrevocably, nor forever; but as a fig, or a bunch of grapes, in the appointed season. If you long for these in winter, you are foolish. So, if you long for your son, or your friend, when you cannot have him, remember that you are wishing for figs in winter. For as winter is to a fig, so is every accident in the universe to those things with which it interferes. In the next place, whatever objects give you pleasure, call before yourself the opposite images. What harm is there, while you kiss your child, in saying softly, ""Tomorrow you may die ; "" and so to your friend, "" Tomorrow either you or I may go away, and we may see each other no more ""?”*

I believe it follows that your guilt is unwarranted and unfair. That guilt which you suffer is the product of ruminating upon that which your family does not have, and how they may be deprived of some things in life. Yet everyone is deprived of something in life, and many a man would trade his depression or anxiety for one of his senses. Happiness is not found in any one of life's grand offerings, but in the ones that we are able to treasure. Yet how many men refuse to value their sight and hearing on a daily basis? How many men forget what they have and are made miserable by what they seek out?

Man’s curses of misfortune are self inflicted, one needs only see that good fortune is not guaranteed, and he shall never be troubled by fortune again. Indeed, it is the man who rolls the die with expectations of winning who is disappointed when he loses. The man who rolls the die with no expectation is grateful for winning, and unsurprised by losing.

1,You guys liked my last one so here's another Seneca quote artwork I wanted to make. 
1,"Dropping out of school in the pursuit of happiness So I decided to drop out of college to pursue a more simplistic life in the hopes it brings me more happiness than my current situation. But am I unstoic for me to not play the cards I got delt, not make the best of my current situation?"
1,We Don't Want It - Anthony De Mello 
1,"Stoicism for a Better Life - Weekly exercise (October 21) Hello there, 

For this week’s exercise, let us once again look to Marcus Aurelius' Meditations, which he wrote himself to keep disciplined in his own Stoic practices. This is VII 56-57:

&gt;""Think of the life you have lived until now as over and, as a dead man, see what's left as a bonus and live it according to Nature. Love the hand that fate deals you and play it as your own, for what could be more fitting?""  

This is such a powerful thought and exercise. I try and incorporate this into my daily morning routine to ensure I begin my day with the right perspective. We have an irrational fear of acknowledging our own mortality. In fact, we tend to harbour a lot of anxieties regarding our impermanence and we let these ideas fester in the recesses of our minds where we shove unwanted thoughts and feelings.

However, reflecting on mortality (which is 100% guaranteed) in a logical and rational manner often has the opposite effect of what you would expect. Instead of a sombre nihilistic sadness, one can find cosmic perspective, motivation and invigoration to make the most of our limited temporal time here. This is precisely what Marcus Aurelius is referring to in the above quote and the reason why the topic of death permeates the Stoic school of thought.

**So as a practical exercise this week, try and reflect on your inevitable and unavoidable death.** It may be uncomfortable at first, but try and embrace the fact that you are on a very short journey, and soon you will die. The goal of the exercise: **Truly embrace the value of your time and use it the way such a valuable resource deserves to be used.**

As always, if you want to keep the conversation going, just reach out. You guys have a great week.

1,What is another way than feeling bad for people when something doesn't work out for them? It seems like we were brought up to feel bad for other people when things don't work out for them and they are upset. What is a good stoic perspective on what to view this? 
1,"I find no purpose in a normal life I love reading all these stoic texts and quotes but eventually reality kicks in and I realize I have nowhere to apply it. I feel like a hamster running in a wheel, most of my life is spent working for a wage doing things I'd rather not do just to survive and accumulate money for no real reason except to buy stuff and consume.

I feel like the main reason I even need money is for fuel to go to work, a house to rest in between work shifts and food to survive. I feel like a ""wage-slave"", my purpose is to work because it's the thing I do most of all but I don't know why."

My brain keeps zoning out and worrying and fretting over the worst possible outcome. I don't know what to do, I feel numb and I also am fucking terrified. How do I use stoicism to focus on my task at hand, my exam coming up in 2 weeks? I've been preparing for it for so long."
1,What is your greatest challenge or the hardest part about practicing stoicism? 
1,"Trying to start a new routine, what daily reading and/or morning journaling do you do? Hi everyone.

I've been practising stoicism for a while now and I'm looking for passages to read in the morning so I can write a short statement or reflection in my journal to set me up for the day? I'm not that keen on The daily stoic and would prefer something more hearty. It doesn't have to be from the ancients either.

1,Should the Inner Citadel by Hardot be read before reading the Meditations ? 
1,"Why is it that ""wisdom"" is good and ""being wise"" is not? ""We of the Stoic school believe that the Good is corporeal, because the Good is active, and whatever is active is corporeal. ... They declare that wisdom is Good; it therefore follows that one must also call wisdom corporeal. But they do not think that “being wise” can be rated on the same basis. For it is incorporeal and accessory to something else, in other words, wisdom; hence it is in no respect active.""

What I mean by productive conversations that really matter is conversations like job interview, negotiation, banter, dating conversation, confrontation, etc. 

I have been trying to fix this, but have not been able to till now. I mean I can dance in front of people or sing in front of them, but I find it really hard and scary to open my mouth and form coherent sentences in front of others while conversing about things that really matter. 

I’ve realised since joining TRP and identifying problems within me that I have somehow developed a defence mechanism to cover up this flaw of mine and started joking around with everyone. Everyone around me thinks that I am never serious in my life and am a joker of some sort who only has conversations to entertain everyone. Some people find it cool and some find it annoying. But I find it defeating. I am held back because of it. 

I am scared of having conversations and I want to do something about it. Could anyone here help me?

1,"I would like to know your opinion about this I would like to know your opinion about some thoughts I had today while studying more about Stoicism. Beforehand , I would like to clarify that is just an opinion and is not meant to be as criticisms towards Stoicism. In fact, I’m trying really to live according to what they consider virtues in life in order to “be happier”, as I find them honorable. 

The thing is that I’m starting to find this philosophy of life a bit idealistic.  I think that the concept of a virtuous life and living according to nature is beautiful and honorable. However, to think that humans are able to live not falling into vice I think is quite impossible if we start from the fact that we live in a system that is totally out of harmony with nature and its natural order. 
For this reason our rational capacity is perhaps syntonized with the broken system we live in. 
We are constantly exposed to messages selling us the image that for example: what causes pleasure is the goal. I mean,the purpose would be what make us feel, the sensation. The provoked sensation can be bad or good but this mustn’t be the goal or focus. Otherwise, I can create  a dependency and if that’s the case it would be linked again to the intemperance vice, so is not virtuous.

Maybe it sounds like a conspiracy but I think the virtues ( wisdom, justice, courage, &amp; moderation) are shown in a way that we humans  focus on the “effects”of it. And following this path, we just end up living more according to vices. 

I would like to know your opinion about this and if you believe is actually possible to live fully according to this philosophy or if is just to apply it more in a flexible way. 

My first language is not English, my apologies if there is any mistake or if my idea is not clear enough."
1,"What would your Stoic response be in this situation? \**Please keep in mind that I am a padawan of the Stoic Philosophy\**

You have an important doctor's appointment at 4pm. You are missing work for this appointment but it is important because it deals with your health.

You arrive early to your appointment and are seated in the examination room only to be waiting there for an entire hour before the nurse shows up - where she first asks what I am being seen for today.

As a student of the Stoic Philosophy, I know that I need to control only what I can actually control in this situation - my perspective on the situation. I cannot assume that the doctor was being lazy and that is why he is late. Speculation like that leads to irrational anger and does nobody any good.

That being said, it is taught in Stoicism that we are supposed to do what we can (within our control) to help our community practice virtue - and therefore live more fulfilling lives.

**In light of the previous sentence, wouldn't it be within the philosophical practice to make the Medical staff aware that this sort of thing wastes time that I cannot get back? If I do not tell them, this could be affecting other, more seriously ill patients, who need to be seen more quickly.**

I smiled and accepted the fact that the doctor was so late but I am trying to figure out if that was the more Stoic thing to do."

1,"Trying to find a specific quote, pls help It's something along the lines of ""to face catastrophe with a cool head robs it if it's impact""."
1,"Just running errands: purpose, satisfaction, and indifference &gt; The point of the Stoics was that a thing may serve to give direction to action without being an object of desire. This is obviously true. Supposing you are a servant, sent to fetch a parcel from the post office for your employer; you may be perfectly indifferent as to whether the parcel has arrived or not, yet your whole action in going to the post office, all the consecutive movements of your feet, will be directed by an intention; but if you found that the parcel was not there, you would not be disappointed, and rest satisfied with having fulfilled your part of the business. That is a type of the attitude of the Stoic Wise Man towards outward things. (Edwyn Bevin, *Stoics and Sceptics*, qtd. in *The Meditations*, trans. G.M.A Grube)

This is a common idea in Stoicism, but I hadn’t previously seen it out this way. Parcels, parcels, everywhere!"
1,"You’re just being lazy This comment really got under my skin during an argument regarding a dog toy that was ripped to shreds. I’ll spare the details. Long story short she said I was being lazy and my first thought was to list off all the things I’ve done today. Second thought was to say “I’m shocked I even managed to take a shower.”
The latter is the more stoic thing to do I’m aware however does anyone who have been practicing for awhile still have those thoughts to fight back vs insults? This has been my biggest struggle and my main focus to improve as of late. 
Thanks for reading, -fK"
1,"How do you manage to stay productive and not procrastinate because of constant distractions? Hi folks, I've been getting into Stoicism since my curiosity was raised by the *Meditations* collection, but now I require some guidance.

&amp;#x200B;

Personal stuff up ahead:

I've been dedicating the last year of my life towards bettering myself and working on my mental issues. I decided not to be employed, because I feel like my growth is greatly stunted by the carrier i've been bestowed with (cook/chef).

I managed to climb out of a very deep suicidal rut and now that I'm actually dealing with my depression, I finally have the energy to do things which I want, instead of doing them only because I'm being forced to.

Setting plans and the intention is all there, but somehow, almost like it's an outside force, sweeps me off of my feet and I end up looking back at my day, feeling like the whole day was wasted.

How do I stay focused and not get sucked into my phone? If not the phone, then the laptop. I gave up on a hardcore PC gaming addiction and now I've got this."
1,Are there similar quotes to this from Stoic thinkers? 
1,"Girl talks to me but seems like only when she must. Advice? So I was friends with this girl for a long time and recently, ever since school started, she’s been leaving me on read on Snapchat (On read means she read my message and didn’t respond). This is very unusual but she claims that she’s really busy and leaves everyone on read so I didn’t think much about it.

Anyway today we set up a time to chat for us to chat for an hour (prompted by me btw) and as we did she was constantly on her phone responding to people’s snaps during our conversation. I didn’t even look at my phone to see if j got any notifications.

What would be the stoic way to approach this problem? Should I call her out on it? Should I tell her that next time she’s gotta make plans? I can only control what I do but idk if letting it go of this is a good idea, I want her to know my displeasure.

Anything helps, thanks"
1,"Do you think our world as a whole is actually is based on irrational, non-Stoic ideas? If so, how do you deal with it? I've been practising Stoicism for a long time, approximately ten years, even though my involvement in this subreddit is much, much more recent.

Stoicism has helped and is still helping me a lot but over these years I've come to realise how distant Stoic values are from the ones all of us  are  bombarded with every day. I feel like I am living in a world where rationality has actually no place and the nature of our relationships seems to be purely predatory or opportunistic at times, especially when money and/or status are involved, whether explicitly and not.

I've been mulling over how to conciliate my Stoic practise and beliefs with the external attempts trying to prove that they are completely wrong or even downright irrational. What  I've been wondering is whether you have ever experienced such feelings since starting your Stoic practise and  how you would deal or come to terms with this understanding.

Thanks for your replies."

1,"Waiting What do you do when you feel like you have no control over what is happening around you? Do you worry, or do you accept your fate? Or something in between?

A few months ago I was in a Saigon coffee shop chatting with my computer scientist friend Long and my writer friend Reece. Reece is from New York originally, but has made Vietnam his new home. We had been friends for many years, and tried to meet at least once every two weeks. I had just introduced Long to him, and we were talking about technology, a bit of philosophy, a bit of teaching, but the topic that dominated most of our conversation, just like all other conversations at the time, was the unfolding pandemic.

“We had to interrupt the classes. It’s not good. We were preparing for the exams in a few months, so now I don’t know what we are going to do.”, said Long with a pained expression on his face.

Reece complemented: “Yeah, I am lucky that all my work is remote anyway, so it hasn’t affected me much.”

“Do you guys feel we should just wait it out, and hope that things will get better soon?”

Long raises his hand and twists it from side to side, the way Vietnamese gesture for ‘no’: “Cannot do that. We need to adapt. We don’t know how long this will last. We need to make a plan and change the way we do things. I am very worried. And you two should be worried too.”

“I think we shouldn’t overreact. These crises happen in cycles, there’s always a recession, or a stock market crash, and eventually everything goes back to what it was before. Just ride the wave out, that’s what I say.”, stated Reece confidently.

I had my own thoughts, but before I shared them I wanted to hear the position of each of them in more detail, to see if I could understand their context, where they are coming from. In my experience most of the time that people disagree is not because they hold diametrically opposing thoughts, but more because they started from different positions, and are seeing the same problem from their own perspective.

“So Reece, don’t you worry that if this turns out to be a more prolonged recession, work might start drying up?”

“Yeah, I suppose there’s that danger. But I have some money saved for eventualities like that, so I can just ride it out.”

Long interjects: “You are assuming that it will get back to normal. But what if it doesn’t? What if we reach a breaking point and everything changes in a way that we cannot predict now?”

“I don’t think that’s likely. Besides, I have a couple of projects going on at the same time. If one gets cancelled, the one one will surely go through.”

Long didn’t sound convinced. I turn to him and ask: “Long, what makes you so worried?”

“I worry for the exams, of course, but I also worry long term. We will have to cancel next term completely if the lockdown continues.”

Reece frowns, pulling his head backwards: “You don’t have a plan B, a way to adapt? Maybe the university should be thinking of how they can change the curriculum, or teach remotely via video?”

“We don’t have time, we have to act quickly. People need to know what is going to happen, they need certainty.” responds Long with measured words, but with his tone of voice betraying his hopelessness. “What do you think?”, he asks, turning to me.

This is a situation unprecedented in our lifetime. Certainly we cannot act as if nothing is happening, and bury our heads in the sand. Self-deception is the enemy. We must have the courage to face things exactly as they are. But also to plunge ahead and make changes without due consideration is not wise. I have strong opinions about this as many times in my life I have been in situations where I had little control over what was happening around, and had to learn the hard way not to be impatient, but also to make the correct preparations to come out strong from the other side.

With these thoughts in my mind I say my piece:

“The rain will come in its own time. We cannot make it come, we have to wait for it. There is danger in the situation, so we need to be strong. But strength in the face of danger is not to rush impatiently, but to bid our time. If we are weak, in the face of danger we grow agitated, and don’t have the patience to wait.”

“Waiting though is not simply hoping that things will change by themselves, without effort from our part. Good waiting is when we have the certainty that we will reach our goal, without illusions, being honest about our situation. We have to know that all the pieces of the puzzle are in place, we have made our contribution, so all we can do now is wait.”

“Once we have all the facts, know we have done our best, have come to terms with reality, then we are prepared, and can wait and act with resolution and perseverance. When we are preparing the broth for phở, we need to make sure we have all the ingredients. Then when we start cooking, the broth will then be ready when it is ready, there’s no use being anxious about it.”

“That sounds very Confucian.” says Reece with a small giggle. He knows me well.

“Hmmm, you are right.” nods Long. “Rushing is rarely good. I think this is a time for us to think deep, make ourselves strong inside, and be prepared for what will come on the other side.”

“Wise words. I think my hunger is starting to make me feel impatient. Let’s make ourselves strong with some warm soup.”"

+ Now before you say go visit a doctor or seek help...
I have vented out to my parents....they understood myself and gave a solution: just leave it just do it....
Give it time... You will understand eventually......

To clarify a couple of things...I am good boy..I am above average ..I have skills and something u could enjoy being with me.....

+ Recently I read a holy book....it said just surrender to god..it somehow landed on me I read it..it gave me a piece and peace of mind.....so I decided well let's follow god...but then I have this small doubt that wether god even exists....

+I took famous people interviews and many of the instances of peers or people that I respect ...
It indicated one thing ..
      
     Do what you like ...put the heart to it...don't worry about failures....-i understand this mentally but not whole heartedly

+Also I asked recently about this whole hearted thing and a fellow stoic answered me to change my beliefs of myself(thanks for creating this community)...he said it is hard but u feel good if u do it genuinely.....

+Summary again
     - do I really need the belly fire to do stuff?
    -if yes then direct me how to do it...
   - if no just put a simple reason...
   
As I said I understand mentally  the fellow stoic said but I didn't understand from my heart or the experience that makes me go ""aha that's what he was refering to""...
I am a follower..I follow anything whether I like it or not..(but getting online advice is a bit doubtful idk why again my beliefs)

I understand that the belly fire comes at some circumstances and also it should be tailored or sculpted by the required person...
But if you think u could give me some instructions pls provide...

Last summary:is there a way to handle this stoically...

Literally u are awardable if u read thru this...thank you"
1,"Key to a happy life: love something good and become good at what you love I have thought about what makes for a happy life and inspired by Stoicism and Aristoteles thoughts about what makes for a good life, I think I have found my take on it.

Like the title say: find something good/virtues that you love and that you can become competent in, it should align with your natural talents in other words.

For example, if you love the idea of teaching and have a talent for it, becoming a teacher could make you happy. On the other hand, if you love the idea of you teaching but have no talent at all for teaching, it will probably not make you happy. Likewise if you are naturally gifted with teaching but hate the idea of teaching then it also have a lesser chance of making you happy.  I think it also needs to be something that you know is virtues in your heart and mind. If you are talented and working with something that you know deep inside is unethical, you will probably not be happy either. Of course, this concerns not only career choices but any role in life: father, wife etc and one has many roles simultaneously in life.

Any thoughts on this? Maybe I am stating something very obvious here but thought I'd share :)"
1,"Stoicon, Stoic Week and Ryan Holiday Fellow Stoic Proficientes

I had the opportunity to participate last Saturday on Stoicon Virtual Event. It was really amazing day, quite one for Stoic Endurance during +8 hours of very interesting presentations. I enjoyed very much the ones of Donald Robertson, John Sellars, Tim LeBon (SMRT), Greg Lopez, Massimo Pigliucci, and William Irvine, and was also surprised by Chuck Chakrapani's presentation as well - I haven't heard about him before.

However, even though I knew he wasn't on the program - I would have enjoyed a presentation from Ryan Holiday on the matter. From him I get the most content on Stoicism. I have read a few books from Stoic presenters (Donald Robertson and Massimo Pigliucci), but Ryan's writing is the one I enjoy the most, from his books (TOITW, EITE, SITK), his Daily Stoic emails and Podcast, and I'm currently waiting for his new book Lives of The Stoics to arrive to my door.

I started as well last Sunday to participate on Stoic Week, and have found a happy coincidence (?): main theme for Monday was Progress, and main theme for today Tuesday is Happiness.

Daily Stoic emails/Podcast from Monday centered as well on Progress (It’s About Crossing One Thing Off After Another), and from Today on Happiness also (If You Want to Feel Better, Do This).

From the group of Scholars, Donald Robertson it seems is the one most engages with Ryan Holiday, and vice versa, having praised his new book (Ryan did the same with How to Think Like a Roman Emperor), and even promoting it on his twitter post from today.

I find it a happy coincidence as it's good that (casually) Stoic Week and Daily Stoic are discussing the same topics. Hopefully we'll see tomorrow if such a coincidence still holds :)

1,"Thinking in terms of stoicism has helped me change what I have control over! First of all, I would like to thank this sub for existing. From the challenges to the examples through user posts, and the wiki, it's been useful.

I dove into MBTI because I wanted to understand why I see the world differently. Turned out I am a rare personality type, INFJ. We have tons of flaws and problems, our brains just don't work the way everyone else works. Because we are so rare we are typically not given the correct nurture, and are left up to nature to develop. I too, ended up developing in odd ways, constantly tripping up and stumbling through crippling depression and failures in just general execution of life itself. The more I learned about myself, the more I became disappointed in who I am. I also fell into the trap of just accepting it. This is who I am, and I can't change.

Then I found stoicism. The idea to just let go of what you can't control was pleasant, since my type uses intuition to constantly predict endless future possibilities of one's own life, falling into a loop of fear of losing control. Then after I started letting go and investing less effort into what cannot be controlled, I turned my attention the opposite way. I took control of me. Nature would no longer be the defining factor of my life. Instead, if I had to nurture myself, then that is what I will do.

An INFJ to break it down, is someone who is Introverted, iNtuitive, Feeling, Judging (not judgmental).

We gain our energy from being alone, and I don't like that. I don't want to be cloistered up all the time. Sure I enjoy my books, my documentaries, my endless dives into the pits of knowledge and wisdom where I can go days without remembering other's exist. I have slowly made an effort to go out every weekend and enjoy spending time with people and investing into maintaining some kind of friendships. I accepted the fact that 1) They are people and they can fail me, and 2) I may need time to myself from time to time. So Now 1 weekend out of the month is for me, and 3 are spread amongst 3 different friend groups. Most people can't even tell I am an introvert, and I don't feel like one either. 

INFJ's are ""feelers"", people who have deep empathy and are usually very quick to rash emotions weather its anger, frustration, love, hate, happiness, etc. We connect and exacerbate emotions at light speed, making us sometimes do the irrational thing. Thinker types are typically very logical and usually don't take up an emotion or a feeling without thinking about it first. Through taking a stoic approach to everything that happens around me, I have limited how much emotional energy I expend, making me feel better, having more energy, and also not over investing into empathy (INFJ's are walking empaths). Instead I resort to thinking before feeling as much as I can, helping me to not over extend.

Judging does not mean being judgmental. The opposite if Perceiving. Judging means carrying out judgement. Perceiving means to wait and see before deciding. I am one of those types as you can probably tell that combining rash emotion with the natural need to making a decision NOW, is deadly. I tell my self to slow down, think, analyze, decide if I need to act now or later. A stoic approach helps filter out so many questions that before seemed necessary, but now, are pointless. There are so many things that I simply don't have the ability to change, let alone decide a course of action for. Instead I have tried very hard to just wait, listen, observe. Its very, very hard, but I am working on it because this is something I can change, the way I react.

And finally the part I skipped, Intuition (N). I have what some call, gut feeling, the third eye, a 6th sense. It's not perfectly accurate, but its darn close. Scary close. The issue is when your body and mind start to depend on your perception of the invisible as your primary way of seeing the world. The opposite of Intuition, is Sensing, using your physical senses. This is the hardest thing to change. My mind simply does not see the world through physical eyes. Behind everything that happens, my mind is trying to find patterns, read between the lines, analyze clues, and carry out judgment based on things not physically observable by someone who is an S type. The N type of person can often get stuck in this dark area where he relies so heavily on his 6th sense that he starts to make mistakes in his judgement. We use all of our previous experiences to create correlations and patterns to predict how someone will act, how they will think about us, treat us, if they are a threat or can we trust them. The only way to change this, is to stop caring about what people think about me. To stop worrying about how people will see me. The majority of the world is composed of S types anyway, who can't see through me like I see through them using intuition. I have also made it a priority to stop trying to see through people and chose to trust them based on some kind of warm fuzzy feeling in my gut. Taking a cold logical approach, watch their actions. Have people prove themselves by looking at physical things, their past actions, the way they treat the world around them. Use my damn eyes for flips sake.

Either way, I have begun a process of not giving into the nature I was given, and instead, adapt, overcome and evolve into a being that can rationally use all parts given to him by God. To not be limited to just what you were born with, but develop skills and habits that make me worry less, stress lest, and come to better, more efficient, and helpful decisions and conclusions. I may not be able to change others or some things in the world around me, but I sure as hell can work on myself.

TLDR: I am an INFJ based on MBTI testing. I have taken it with a stoic approach, I can change myself and those 4 letters don't define me anymore.

Also, I know that I am no great stoic, and that I am not quoting tons of philosophers here to back up my points (although I have read meditations and letters). Sorry guys. Also, no idea what flair I should make this, correct me if I am wrong."

Then she compared me to him, then said she felt bad etc apologized for certain things and wants to be friends after saying that she will never meet anyone like me again.

1,"It's okay to die. From the beginning of human race, or even of earth, our last destination will always be death. So why we humans fear death if it's something inevitable? 

Some people who fear death creates a make-believe ideas like when they believe on something and die, they will go to some kind of paradise which as long as it makes you happy and less stressed about death, is okay.

But realistically-wise we should not fear death, yet embrace it. As much as we welcome death anytime, we will be able to appreciate every seconds of life more.. everything that matters will be more prioritized and we'll see things in a bigger perspective that if we leave this earth, you're gone, you're going to be part of the earth life cycle where you turn into dust and you'll be usable by plants and animals which are also be usable for humankind.. 

Death should be treated like an honor that you finalized the continuous process of human life.. 

Death is a proof that we are all equal with all living things, small or big.."

1,"Memento mori and ""inferno"" - mrs green apple Thinking about memento mori while listening to music has made me realize how stoic this song is

Here's the lyrics from the english cover from  NateWantsToBattle's youtube channel:

A light unto my darkening
Illuminate the path
Of old familiar days
Now I stay content living a dream
ANow there is no forever
I've been told we'll fade away
So laugh in every day you get
Don't let it go to waste

So if your light is fading
From the shadow of a doubt
We'll light the sky
With our
Inferno
We'll keep marching right until
Our fire's burning outm I becoming lazy
Living careless and free?

It's a light unto my darkening
What happened to the comfort
Of the streets that we walked?
Now the cold at time is
Worse than it seems
But we can light a fire
And we'll fight it

Now we can find a way
Through the fire and the flames
Now it's burning in my heart
Just like a melody

Now there is no forever
I've been told we'll fade away
So laugh in every day you get
Don't let it go to waste

So if your light is fading
From the shadow of a doubt
We'll light the sky
With our
Inferno
We'll keep marching right until
Our fire's burning out

Now at what point did we stop it all?
And now that you're not moving
You feel like you can't fall
But a still flame doesn't burn at all
We gotta keep the fire burning
Hotter, hotter

I can taste it it's so close to me
But in the end you take your time
Then it'll soon rot
Though it might feel like
It's burning down
The scars you wear
Remind you that you made it

Then we'll evaporate
As we rise up to the sky
In my hands I will protect
These precious memories

As we're walking down this road
We'll look up and start to fly
You will never be alone
We work in harmony

Now there is no forever
I've been told we'll fade away
So laugh in every day you get
Don't let it go to waste

So if your light is fading
From the shadow of a doubt
We'll light the sky
With our
Inferno
We'll keep marching right until
Our fire's burning out

I'm not afraid
To keep the fight going
Sometimes you keep on
Feeling your pain
I saw the
Fire in your eyes burn
Stronger inside you now

Burning brighter
Every single day

There might be no forever now
So what we're bound
To burn and fade away?
So treasure every day
Don't let it go to waste

So if your light is fading from
The shadow of a doubt
We'll light the sky
With our
Inferno
We'll keep marching right until our
Fire's burning out!

First it starts talking about how you could become lazy by not caring about anything and living the way you wanna live.

Then it talks about change:

&gt;It's a light unto my darkening What happened to the comfort Of the streets that we walked? Now the cold at time is Worse than it seems But we can light a fire And we'll fight it.

So even if it seems like the cold in your life is unbearable, you still have to fight it don't let the sad in changing your life get over you.

&gt;Do what you will. Even if you tear yourself apart, most people will continue doing the same things. -Marcus Aurelius

Then the next part is all about memento mori:

&gt;Now there is no forever I've been told we'll fade away So laugh in every day you get Don't let it go to waste So if your light is fading From the shadow of a doubt We'll light the sky With our Inferno We'll keep marching right until Our fire's burning out

How even if there is no eternity you should not let your days be ruined by sadness.

&gt;I'm not afraid To keep the fight going Sometimes you keep on Feeling your pain I saw the Fire in your eyes burn Stronger inside you now Burning brighter Every single day

Here it shows that you should always keep on trying to live your best life, even if something really sad happens like the death of a close one you should always put on a fight and try to stay as calm as possible and if you can't do that on your own seek the help of others, stoicism is about helping others as well as this quote from Marcus Aurelius 

&gt;Acquire the habit of attending carefully to what is being said by another, and of entering, so far as possible, into the mind of the speaker.

&gt;I can taste it it's so close to me But in the end you take your time Then it'll soon rot Though it might feel like It's burning down The scars you wear Remind you that you made it.

This part reminds me of amor fati. All the scars that you have are proof that you made it out even stronger than before that your destiny gave you a problem and you proved yourself worthy of beating it.

&gt;Do not seek for things to happen the way you want them to; rather, wish that what happens happen the way it happens: then you will be happy. -Epictetus

1,"Stuck in a loop of materialism. How do I find clarity of mind? I (M, Mid-twenties) try and read stoic philosophy as much as possible, and am a firm believer in it's messages. I know fully well that happiness cannot be found in materialism, however I notice myself constantly slipping back into the thought pattern that I'd be much happier with objects. 

I am currently studying an engineering degree in surveying, so money isn't exactly flowing through me at the moment but that's ok, but maybe that's the reason I wish for more? I also come from a pretty well off family, and since moving out of home I've began to appreciate how hard one has to work to achieve a certain standard of living. 

I'm not sure how to put my thoughts exactly into words, a bit lost is all. How have others navigated such thought patterns?"

1,"Stoicism approach to feeling down when seeing other people happy? This is a new-ish problem of mines that started around 3 months ago. Whenever I see people, for example on the internet, happy I get kinda upset-feel bad. I swear I’m not a grumpy person (lol). This issue of mine’s have made me so annoyed at people watching my favorite films because the films were good. I know it sounds so entitled, I would be annoyed too if someone on the internet tried to gatekeep a show for no reason. I recognize the problem and I have no idea why I get down when seeing those things. I don’t really act on it, it’s more just feeling sad when people are enjoying something.

https://learn.modernstoicism.com/p/stoic-week"
1,"Is Seneca's approach to 'seizing the day' the same as Horace's 'Carpe Diem? Seneca said: ""The greatest obstacle to happiness is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow, and loses today. You are planning what lies in Fortune’s control and abandoning what lies in yours. Begin to live at once, and treat each separate day as a separate life.""

Horace's 'Carpe Diem' is often misinterpreted as something like Nike's 'Just do it!' However I think this is a better translation:  ""Pluck the day, for it is ripe, relying as little as possible on tomorrow.""

Seneca and Horace both agree on the importance of this day. But would they have done the same kind of thing on any particular day? My guess is that they probably differ somewhat in their understanding of this idea. Could any of you who know the texts better than me explain the differences between these two men?"

It's interesting because she's not someone I would want to be with logically due to some of her behaviors and she tends to be disrespectful, but emotionally I miss her like crazy and I really want to call her and try to make things work against all my logic. My logic tells me that this is a blessing in disguise as I've known we needed to go our separate ways but my emotional self seems to be stronger than my rational self and I really am negativity affected by this"

I am a Year 12 student currently doing an essay on Stoicism in regards to victimhood. Does anyone have anything they wish to add or comment about on this topic that they believe would be useful for my assignment? 

Some of these things could include comments on what they believe certain philosopher’s views would be on victimhood from the POV of a Stoic or how they should handle things such as sexual assault. Should they play the victim or should they just move on and forget about it? Is there any point in playing the victim? 

Anything helps! Even your own views on the topic will be interesting.

Thanks!

1,"How can stoicism help me mature emotionally? I (F24) am currently living at home with my mum and sister. I moved back in after I graduated last year. I've always felt young for my age but over the last year I've started acting like an angry 14 year old. 

All I seem to do is sit on my phone, researching my problems and talking to people about them. I have become abusive to my partner and emotionally shut off from those around me. I seem to resent people and assume they don't like me. I don't have the drive to do any actual hobbies, I'm becoming incredibly self obsessed and self indulgent. I pity myself for situations that I have put myself in, and I do nothing to fix them. I don't feel like I'm living IN my life. I feel like I'm less mature than I was at 18. I talk about myself all the time and have days where I find it hard to think about anyone else. People have tried to help me but I'm set on 'fixing it myself' but after another day of lying in bed researching potential personality disorders I think this is getting ridiculous. My motivation to change seems to disappear so fast. I really dislike myself and don't understand how I'm in this place. The more aware I am of needing to stop acting in my ego the more I seem to do it. 

I've bought many self help books but don't have the motivation to read them. I've started remote volunteering but am too lazy to contribute much. I promise my partner that I'll get better and communicate better but some days I struggle to connect with my own actions and his feelings. I'm in therapy but paying someone £40 to talk about myself AGAIN seems counterproductive. 

I don't understand how I'm in this place at 24. I thought I would be in a happy relationship or living in France or volunteering with animals or learning how to make clothes but instead I've become a lazy self pitying directionless lump. Even my 19 year old sister has told me to start acting my age. 

Anyone have any tips on how to grow up? I know stoicism is about acceptance and living by logic so I think that would help. 

TL;DR : have regressed massively since leaving uni and am now very toxic and immature. I'm not sure how to get out of this slump. Any advice on maturing emotionally greatly appreciated."

It's a French Roast Vietnamese De Lat and it tastes very much something the Stoic philosophers would enjoy. It's very much free of the passions and pleasures and focuses on the rich flavor and the robust, smooth finish.

They have an online store where you can purchase Stoic Bond and many other flavors, but their stock is limited.

So, I am still texting with my ex and this really really hurts sometimes. You know, seeing her with others, feeling like certain things might have been a lie even though I don't really think soo and the overall change in character and behaviour.

BUUT These are outside things. I can't really control them but how I think about them. So from that perspective on it's good practice to keep the occasional pain by texting with her so that I have to deal with it and keep an eye on remaining virtuous. I also like to be there for people if there are problems and bringing happiness to them by spreading positivity and good vibes. 

On the other hand though, it's really painful but as we know happiness comes from living a virtuous life. The question as well is if it this has even something to be with being virtuos…is being nice and kind, helping others and not ""banning"" them out of your life virtuous? 

I feel like I am missing out on something in terms of me asking this question and of course in terms of the answer to this question. So what are your thoughts?

1,"The Irony in stress I don't know if this has ever happened to you, but you are just minding your business waking up whenever you please and then suddenly one day you have an appointment or assignment or test or meeting and you need to be up slightly earlier than you usually wake up. You get into your bed slightly earlier than usual, read a book, shut off the light, then you cant sleep, no worries just open up your computer and watch a show, nice that was a good episode, time for another, holy fuck! it's 3 AM, well I'm not tired so another episode, holy shit its almost 5 am, the daylight is starting to break and i have to be up in 3 hours, you put your head on the pillow and fight your thoughts preventing you from sleeping, you get angry at yourself for letting this happen, now you are stressed about the early wake up and how little sleep you will get and what that will do to you long term. 

&amp;#x200B;

In an alternative universe where you didn't have that appointment or assignment or test or meeting or whatever, you fell asleep exhausted at 1 am and woke up comfortably at 9am. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where we are at with our thoughts, we procrastinate that project due or test we have to do, however if you would of just been on a schedule from the get go, or chewed away at the project much earlier you wouldn't be wasting time and wallowing in your own stress.

&amp;#x200B;

Stress is kind of paradoxical, it achieves the very opposite of what we hope, back in the tribal hunter gatherer days it was very useful and effective, however now you think that social gathering is a predator waiting to get you, making you more socially awkward. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not saying, hey don't get stressed out, its stupid and achieves the exact opposite of what it is set out to accomplish. It is almost impossible to avoid stress, but it is possible to acknowledge it, just by saying, oh you little cheeky bastard I saw what you did there, you gave me a fight or flight response when I was forced to ask a question on zoom, or when I was talking to that cute girl. But don't interact with it, just pay attention to that feeling and be analytical about it, but don't become submerged in thoughts."

1,"A question regarding Seneca’s “Letters from a Stoic” In Letter VII, Seneca is instructing Lucilius to avoid the rabble of whom would not benefit from Lucilius’ learnings. Indeed, he says:

“You might perhaps come across one here and there [of the mob who understand], but even they would need to be trained and developed by you to a point where they could grasp with your teaching. “For whose benefit, then, did I learn it all?“ If it was for your own benefit that you learnt it you have no car to fear that your trouble may have been wasted.

It’s in this last sentence that my question arises: “If it was for your own benefit that you learnt it you have no car to fear that your trouble may have been wasted.” What does this mean?

At first glance I thought it meant “don’t worry if no one understands you and your learning, it’s for your own benefit you learn and grow in learning”. But then Seneca goes on to say in the next sentence: “Just to make sure that I have not been learning solely for my own benefit today, let me share with you three fine quotations... “

It appears he is wanting to avoid learning for the sake of ones own sole benefit. But then what does he mean by the previous sentence?"

Not only does he dislike me but he’s trying to reduce my favor in the eyes of the boss. In little ways. 

But then in other ways he credits me a lot and helps me out in certain ways.

The issue is that although it’s a different department, I still get a lot of my work from him. 

So what should I do?"

1,"Practicing Stoicism while Working a Phone Bank: This weekend, I spent time working a phonebook encouraging people to vote in the U.S. General Election. Cold-calling others is a thrilling experience. There is no guarantee how a person will answer a call from an unknown number, and given the amount of spam calls people receive, frustration from their end is understandable. 

To prepare for the experience, I reread from Marcus Aurelius’ *Meditations* Book II, 1:

*When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own—not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine.* 

I’ve admired this passage for how it lays out Marcus’ clear-sightedness and compassion: he knows people can be difficult, and yet he remains committed to humanity. Since we all share a common nature, there’s no need to be upset at the slights and harshness of others. They are to be expected and not what binds us together.

That day, I listened to my fare share of frustration, anger, and curt hang ups. I also spoke to people who were excited to vote, to contribute in their way to the cosmopolis. My last call was with a woman over a hundred years old, who was grateful someone even called her at all.

It was a reminder as Marcus would say that,

*We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower.* 

Teeth sometimes grind against each other. Knuckles sometimes crack against the opposite hand. Feet step on feet. And yet, through productive tension a practicing Stoic like myself can center himself in equanimity and find a reminder of our common nature.

Thanks for reading,

Ross"
1,"Does anyone here have the original Ancient Greek version of Meditations? Chapter (verse? section?) 4:17 hit me like an absolute freight trans when I first read it:

This is from the Penguin Classics version translated by Martin Hammond.

I would like to see what this looks like as it was originally written by Marcus Aurelius himself, but don't want to pay $35 for a book that I'm only going to read for 10 seconds.

1,"Momento mori 
I didnt know what momento mori was 2 months ago. I was rather new to stoicism.  I didnt even know why I have gotten into stoicism.  But I went head first into. Did alot of reading about M.M. even had the symbol of momento mori as a screen saver. I asked myself why? After 42 am I in to this all of a sudden?
     The universe was preparing me.  As I'm reading about death and how it was treated in the ancient times and into the middle ages and how people's views of death changed in the 20th century and it is celebrated and part of life like it was in the past, at that same moment  my nurse wife noticed a lump on the left side of my neck.  I thought ""who cares, probably allergies "" went to Dr. Said its probably nothing, had me get ct scan, bloodwork, ultrasound,  recommended me to an ent head and neck cancer doctor.  
     Haven't had a biopsy yet but the head of the dept at a prestigious hospital  looked me in the eye and said ""this. Is. Not. A . Cyst. I think you have throat cancer,  we have to be aggressive with this one, your getting test done asap."" Looked at his head nurse and said ""I want him prioritize, I want him at the top of my list,  cancel future appointments if you have to""
    I am feeling the full weight of 'Momento mori "" right now as I'm writing this.  And I am thankful I mysteriously and unknowingly preparing myself  either for a huge change of life coming; or in all honestly theres a good chance I may die.
  I have 2 young kids, a wife and just started getting my life in order over the last 2 years, battling anxiety,  losing a job, losing friends and family members.  
  So, now my friends in this community,  all of you,  I will let you know how stoicism works out for me in future updates.  So far I've been pretty chill. Haven't had an exact diagnosis yet but this top surgeon said it doesn't look good.   A year ago I would've freaked out. I used to drink alot. I quit drinking and turned to stoicism to replace my anxiety issues from drinking to stoic philosophy.  And I'm doing great, people that know me are stunned how I'm handling it.  I'll update as news comes in. Because I might freak out in a week lol."
1,"Sub Suggestion: User Flairs When someone asks a question here, many of the replies frequently have nothing to do with Stoicism or are an inaccurate portrayal of it.

Having user flairs to identify reliable community members would make it easier for new users to find info that is actually representative of Stoic thought."

1,"Being Stoic vs being a pushover? I'm naturally ""Stoic"" in a few ways. The simplest most trivial example is if a restaurant gets the order wrong. I'm not the person who will send it back, or demand credit for them making a mistake. Plenty of people will get frustrated in the this situation, ask for the food to be remade, and in some scenarios will be angry if they're not given a free something or another. 

But I've worked at a restaurant before, mistakes happen, and the last thing you want is an order to come back to add to the list of things you need to do. So I don't send things back (unless, you know, it's undercooked or something)

That's just one example, but each time this idea comes into my head, I can't help but feel like this is exactly how a ""pushover"" would act. A person who just takes whatever is given to them and never asserts themselves or speaks their mind, in a sense. I'm just wondering what your guys' thoughts are on this idea?"
1,"“You create opportunities by performing, not complaining.” ~ Mickie Siebert So this quote comes from the so-called [first woman of finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muriel_Siebert). As a bisexual woman survivor navigating life as a foreigner every day and code switching constantly across languages to keep up with the world around me, I'm exhausted a lot and have adopted — and adapted — a Stoic praxis into my life. It's helped me respect myself, not to mentio overcome a whole fuck of a lot in life, from family scapegoating to rape and sexual assault (both inside and outside of said family) and gaslighting upon gaslighting upon gaslighting in an effort to troll and leverage my trust in my own mind and doubt my mental health and silence me about these things (which to clearly articulate, aren't complaints. They are abuses, and abuses are things the actual Stoics themselves would not have advocated silence about, no matter how the philosophy is often bastardized today, particularly in corporate environments.)

I do not disagree with this quote; indeed I agree with most of her points about ""professional"" success (though in my own case, most were hammered into me by an emotionally abusive ex). This particular quote in full speaks more specifically to Siebert's experiences as a woman trailblazer in her career, too:
&gt;You create opportunities by performing, not complaining. There were no female role models, so I just blazed my own path. When I came to New York, I had five hundred dollars and a very used Studebaker car.

Mickie Siebert never married or had kids (both coincidentally projects that I do not believe anyone should take on without a robust stoic/mindfulness/detachment praxis, but also projects that should not have anything to do with one's profession or career, regardless of gender). She joined the NYSE in 1967, and was privy to the *Mad Men*-esque, romanticized hypermisogyny of that bygone era of the finance world in the 1970s and 80s.

I do not know if Siebert herself [would have agreed with that keeping silent about physical and mental abuses based on gender is different from ""performing, not complaining""](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviatemin/2013/08/26/what-i-learned-from-mickie-siebert-put-your-head-down-and-charge/#4841a3bd4ece), but I do think her legacy and life philosophy are broadly aligned with Stoicism. I also think that bucking what people who try to manage or control you want is an important part of developing a healthy relationship with Stoic philosophy, and that things have gotten a lot better in a lot of places (and moreover, are a lot better in a lot of places that aren't the US). 

Morally/ethically I cannot condone Siebert's career, finance (especially in the US) as a profession/industry in general, nor the actions of Wall Street/NYSE but I have made my own choices that got me ahead in various ways while bucking convention as well, some that I regret and others that I am proud of. All speak to a nerve of steel that tends to intimidate people and a sense of self that's ultimately been stronger than that of most others I've met. 

I'm interested in discussing with others who have faced active institutional oppression and/or discrimination in life (as opposed to adversity, which everyone faces). How have you all adapted Stoic philosophy into a mindfulness praxis or some other framework to develop resilience and relinquish any illusion of control, while remaining firmly true to yourself and your legacy?"

1,"The power of the shrug. 🤷‍♀️ Our brain reacts to our body, and how we act can influence how we think. Think of your body posture, for example: Standing up straight, keeping your chin up and walking tall can actually make you feel more confident, proud, and powerful. Using a stress ball can relieve tension and reduce blood pressure. Taking deep breaths can calm us down and help clear our minds. I thought I'd share something I do to help me stay Stoic when the defecation hits the oscillation.

I shrug. A lot. This is something my friends have pointed out to me over the years, but I've never stopped doing it. ^(I also use the shrug emoji a lot too.) Something about the physical action, which as a human I have naturally associated with indifference, helps me actually achieve a higher degree of indifference. Obviously, and I want to emphasize this, Stoicism is not about 100% indifference all of the time. But in times where it is very beneficial to remain calm, cool, and collected, beginning my thought process with the physical act of shrugging does wonders to keep me centered.  

Cheers 🤷‍♀️"

Eunice Wong reflects on Daniel Berrigan and “goodness in the time of death”—not a Stoic article, but Stoic students will notice some similarities. Hadn’t heard of either of these people but this is a nice (short) story that discusses the importance of living consistently with one’s values,  recognizing that there is always goodness (or beauty/excellence), and recalling examples in those who came before us."

1,"Pornography This is going to be a bit personal but figured I would reach out. This year Stoicism has really helped me a lot. In fact it has changed my life in some ways, especially in regards to anxiety, recognizing what’s in my control and what is not, among MANY other things! I have read many books on Stoicism and still do everyday and night as a routine, alongside my journaling each day and night. But, the one cardinal virtue I am struggling with is temperance. Specifically related to Porn. I have been making attempts to stop watching it for most of this year, and it’s not because it’s negatively affecting my life but rather because it’s a habit I simply want to break. Especially because I am fortunate to have a great sexual relationship with my fiancée. Initially I was so inspired by Stoicism primarily Marcus Aurelius that I was able to stop watching it for around 27 days. Since then I have gone a few 10+ days of not watching it but tend to resort back to it, quite habitually. I have thought about why I do it and it’s not to fill some sort of void but rather it’s literally a habit. To be honest it’s a habit that I keep convincing myself isn’t even that bad so I keep doing it. I have even been up front with my fiancée about it and she doesn’t mind that I watch it. Each day in the start of my journal I write about how I could make today a success and I tend to write about having self control, then somewhere along the day I watch porn, and by night find myself righting about how I need to have more self control in order to improve. I’ve given this a great deal of thought and it almost seems that because I almost justify watching it by acknowledging I did it and admitting it to myself in my journal I don’t actually stop. When in reality it would be the actually action of stopping that would matter. I have tried different things to break the habit but am always pulled back in. I was introduced to pornography very young around 5-6 years old when my baby sister and her boyfriend would watch it and I feel strongly that it is contributing to this. So I guess that actually is in a sense affecting me negatively because it’s making me unhappy with myself. I know I should consider the shame I will feel afterwards but in the moment I don’t care. I tend to watch it once per day sometimes only 3-4 days a week. I can go days potentially weeks without it if I am on a vacation or traveling or even just staying busy, but when I’m home, bored or haven’t had sex in a few days, that’s when I tend to watch it. I guess that I am not really coming here for an answer but rather looking to have some conversation that might be helpful. Because I’m able to function day to day, and it’s not affecting my life aside from my own sense of guilt I almost feel like I’m just trying to quit because I don’t feel I am truly Stoic by watching it. I should actually WANT to quit which would make it much easier. I know this is long winded and potentially doesn’t make much sense, so if you read it all, thanks. I have been on this sub and semi active for a little while and it took a lot for me to make this post and put myself out there, so thanks for any help or recommendations."
1,"Are externals really not needed for a happy life?  In his book ""The Happiness Hypothesis""  Jonathan Haidt claims that in the modern word some externals are necessary too. 

**When life is unpredictable and dangerous (as it was for the Stoic philosophers, living under capricious Roman emperors), it might be foolish to seek happiness by controlling one’s external world. But now it is not. (Full text below)**

&amp;#x200B;

I don't agree but I  thought this is a really interesting point. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I just wonder what do you think fellows?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**When life is unpredictable and dangerous (as it was for the Stoic philosophers, living under capricious Roman emperors), it might be foolish to seek happiness by controlling one’s external world. But now it is not.** 

**People living in wealthy democracies can set long-term goals and expect to meet them.** We are immunized against disease, sheltered from storms, and insured against fire, theft, and collision. For the first time in human history, most people (in wealthy countries) will live past the age of seventy and will not see any of their children die before them. Although all of us will get unwanted surprises along the way, we’ll adapt and cope with nearly all of them, and many of us will believe we are better off for having suffered. So to cut off all attachments, to shun the pleasures of sensuality and triumph in an effort to escape the pains of loss and defeat—this now strikes me as an inappropriate response to the inevitable presence of some suffering in every life.

&amp;#x200B;

Many Western thinkers have looked at the same afflictions as Buddha—sickness, aging, and mortality—and come to a very different conclusion from his: Through passionate attachments to people, goals, and pleasures, life must be lived to the fullest. I once heard a talk by the philosopher Robert Solomon, who directly challenged the philosophy of nonattachment as an affront to human nature.69 The life of cerebral reflection and emotional indifference (apatheia) advocated by many Greek and Roman philosophers and that of calm non striving advocated by Buddha are lives designed to avoid passion, and a life without passion is not a human life. Yes, attachments bring pain, but they also bring our greatest joys, and there is value in the very variation that the philosophers are trying to avoid. I was stunned to hear a philosopher reject so much of ancient philosophy, but I was also inspired in a way that I had never been as an undergraduate student of philosophy. I walked out of the lecture hall feeling that I wanted to do something then and there to embrace life. Solomon’s message was unorthodox in philosophy, but it is common in the work of romantic poets, novelists, and nature writers: “We do not live but a quarter part of our life—why do we not let on the flood—raise the gates—&amp; set our wheels in motion—He that hath ears to hear let him hear. Employ your senses.” (HENRY DAVID THOREAU, 1851)

&amp;#x200B;

Even a future justice of the U.S. Supreme Court—a body devoted to reason—issued this opinion: “I think that, as life is action and passion, it is required of a man that he should share the passion and action of his time at peril of being judged not to have lived.” (OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES, JR., 1884)71 Buddha, Lao Tzu, and other sages of the East discovered a path to peace and tranquility, the path of letting go. They told us how to follow the path using meditation and stillness. Millions of people in the West have followed, and although few, if any, have reached Nirvana, many have found some degree of peace, happiness, and spiritual growth. So I do not mean to question the value or relevance of Buddhism in the modern world, or the importance of working on yourself in an effort to find happiness. Rather, I would like to suggest that the happiness hypothesis be extended—for now—into a yin-yang formulation: Happiness comes from within, and happiness comes from without. (In chapter 10, I’ll suggest a further refinement of the hypothesis.) To live both the yin and the yang, we need guidance. Buddha is history’s most perceptive guide to the first half; he is a constant but gentle reminder of the yin of internal work. But I believe that the Western ideal of action, striving, and passionate attachment is not as misguided as Buddhism suggests. We just need some balance (from the East) and some specific guidance (from modern psychology) about what to strive for.

I just freeze up and I don't know how to act or what to even say.

1,"Needing some stoic relationship/life advice. I'll have a tl;dr at the bottom.

        My Ex of almost 6 years and I separated back in July. The reason was is she wasn't happy anymore in the relationship. It tore me apart and reduced me to nothing. From that nothing, I am rebuilding myself with stoic principles as my foundation and have been making great strides in my life and doing much better. I had moved past it until now.
        There was a set back and low blow. A mutual friend of ours came to me and confessed that I was cheated on by my ex with another Mutual friend. They are still 'together' and that mutual friend doesn't think I know and continues to try to talk to me. I obviously don't care to talk to him and am trying my hardest not to call him out on it or react with anger. 
        This is also effecting my desire to be in a relationship again and to go through this all. I'm currently talking to someone great and everything was going fine until I heard about the cheating. Now I'm constantly worrying about not being good enough, being cheated on again, and wasting even more of my life. So now I'm riddled with anxiety once again. I'm unsure on how to handle this and would appreciate any help.
Thanks in advance.

TL;DR: Found out my ex cheated on me with a mutual friend and now its affecting my mental health (anxiety) and a possible new relationship. Now I worry about being cheated on and loving in vain."
1,"Evening and Morning Routines Hey Fellow Prokoptons!

What Stoic Practices people here do to bookend their days?

I’ll share mine below, though I’m always looking for ways to change and grow.

Each night, I write in my journal, answering a version of Sextus’ and Seneca’s questions:

&amp;#x200B;

* What did I do right?
* What could I have done better?
* What shall I do tomorrow?

For the last prompt, I look at what I could have done better and formulate my own question to ask myself the next day. For example, if I spent too much time telling stories about myself or trying to be overly clever (a chronic fault of mine), I’ll write – “Ask yourself ‘Who paid money to see you perform? Is that why people are here, to be entertained by you?’”

I then fall asleep and tell myself, “I have lived”, considering the chance that I might not wake to see the morning.

If I do wake up (so far, so good), I read from three Stoic texts I’ve put in rotation: a page Fram *The Meditations*, a chapter from *The Enchiridion*, or one of Seneca’s *Letters*.

Then, I meditate for five minutes, usually interrogating my first thoughts of the day to attempt to figure out what I’m bringing to my day and what’s up to me or what isn’t.

Last, I review the question I set out for myself the night before (“Ask yourself ‘Who paid money to see you perform? Is that why people are here, to be entertained by you?’”), and use it as a guiding focus for the day. 

Looking over all this, it seems like a lot. I’m lucky to be an early riser, so I’m usually awake before my wife and 11 month old daughter, and I fall asleep well after we tuck the little one in. 

If I’m keeping track of time, I’d say each routine takes between fifteen to twenty minutes…not counting the miscellaneous hygiene one does after waking and before sleeping.

What do you do? How could I make this better?

Appreciatively,

Ross"

1,"My favourite Marcus Aurelius quotes! Hey! I've only recently read Aurelius' Meditations at the start of my journey into stoicism and it was awesome! Everyone goes through times of anxiety and doubt and for me, looking back at a quote bank I made while reading his work has helped a lot! I hope it does the same for you :) I've taken highlights from each of my categories to make it more digestable.

**General**

“Disgraceful: for the soul to give up when the body is still going strong.”

“To stop talking about what the good man is like, and just be one.”

""Value of attentiveness varies in proportion to its object. Don't give small things more time than they deserve""

“How much more damage anger and grief do than the things that cause them.”

**Concering other people**

“That to expect bad people not to injure others is crazy. It’s to ask the impossible. And to let them behave like that to other people but expect them to exempt you is arrogant—the act of a tyrant.”

“It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.""

**When something 'bad' happens to you**

""It’s unfortunate that this has happened. No. It’s fortunate that this has happened and I’ve remained unharmed by it- not shattered by the present or frightened of the future. It could have happened to anyone. But not everyone could have remained unharmed by it."" 

**And finally... On procrastination (a little edited lol)**

At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I have to go to work- as a human being. Was I created to huddle under the blankets and stay warm? 

---but its nicer here… Were you born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, birds, ants and bees going about their tasks, putting the world in order as good as they can? And you're not willing to do your job as a human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?

---but we have to sleep sometime… Sure, but nature set a limit on that as it did eating, drinking, gaming. And you're over the limit. You’ve had more than enough of that. But not of working, there you’re still below your quota.
Is helping others less valuable to you? Not worth your effort?"

I have the most experience in this type of thing and so i have to initiate every meeting etc of the team.  The problem: our supervisor for this project has been super involved in the process in the past, this year, my team does not have the gift of the supevisors constant involvement and we cannot go further in the process without the supervisors feedback.  We have a deadline for tomorrow at midnight. We are yet to write the speech or the make the presentation bcz the supervisor will a)not meet with us and b) isn’t reading the outline we shared with them. I feel like not doing anything and letting the project fall through just there’s an example of what happens when the supervisor refuses to cooperate. I also don’t think it would be right of me to be so petty. The rest of the team and i wrote one speech last week, and the supervisor had not told us what direction were supposed to go with it. So, we wrote thee speech and showed it to the supervisor. Didn’t like it at all. Pretty much asked for a new speech. Okay. This time we haven’t received feedback on the outline for the second speech since Wednesday. We have asked the supervisor to read the outline some two three times already. They have told us that they expect the team to do intensive work during today and tomorrow. But we cant move on. It’s frustrating and as team leader, i just don’t know what to do. How would a stoic approach a situation like this? I don’t want to behave in an irrational and immature way."

Both 19yo. Everyone he knew thinks I killed him or pushed him off or had something to do with it. I never realized a lot of my friends and people I knew thought this low of me.

I’ve had a track record with drugs, along with him. I’ve never done anything violent, I’ve never done anything remotely close.

Yet people legitimately think I am killer. That I murdered the kid I damn near looked up to. I don’t know what to do. I feel like just ending shit myself. I don’t want to show my face in this lowlife city. 

People I’ve known for years think I either pushed him off the roof or had something to do with it. I don’t even know what to do. I’m sick to my stomach.

I’m trying to be strong, but this just feels like too much. The people who don’t think I did it just have that notion that I maybe did in the back of their mind no matter what. I thought I was liked, I thought I was viewed as a good person. I guess not. 

I’m fucking lost people. I’m fucking pissed at his family for not clarifying to the public even though I’ve talked to homicide detectives. I will live forever knowing the people I knew growing up think I killed my best friend. 

I shouldn’t care what people think if it’s not true, I shouldn’t pay attention to it yet every biological instinct is screaming “you’ve been alienated from the pack” etc. Some of the closest friends I’ve had recently, friends that I’ve made thousands with turned on me."

1,"Preparing Your Mind to Accept Death? Evening friends,

To keep this short, but not curt I'll cut straight to the chase with minor exposition. Recently, I finally accepted my lifelong urging and decided to join the US military. (21 M) As a human being who spends many hours buried in books and even more hours laboring at the iron throne (Gym) I was offered an option 40x contract... To put it simply, an option 40 puts me directly into the pipeline into the US Army Rangers. 

While I understand that these next few years will be the hardest of my life... That doesn't phase me. I've looked down hundreds if not thousands of tough situations in my life and have applied the Stoic principals to lead me through them all... What concerns me is this thought of death and how I'll react to it.

How can I prepare myself for this elevated likelihood of death? When I train, I train until I can't move... but I know I won't die. When I begin my training with live rounds, explosives, and eventually real combat, how can I prepare myself for this mentally? 

**How can I be ready to die at any moment?** 

I have arranged my civilian affairs already. The less worry I have about home the better, but how can I teach myself to suppress the selfish nature that is the will to desire my life over the task at hand? I understand that I could die driving to the grocery store to get more milk, but I want to prepare for a direct confrontation with death, not indirect. **Any help, references, or guidance would be greatly appreciated.**"

1,"What do I do if my purpose is to suffer? I’m 21 and I’ve suffered as long as I can remember. I’m starting to believe that may be my purpose. Maybe I can’t solve my mental illnesses. I don’t think I see an end case where I “heal” all my mental issues. Another issue I have is I’m showing multiple signs of some type of rectal cancer. I have been for a while but it’s getting worse and I have no healthcare or money for that. I don’t know anyone who does have the money, and I’d sooner die than ask people for money. How do I suffer gracefully? I’m a mess. I’m shaking. Is there any virtue in suffering? I could really use some advice here. Thank you."
1,How are you using Stoicism during this 'pandemic'? 
1,"""We are what we eat."" Do you apply such to your mindscape ? I just want to hear what people think about this. 

We care about what we eat to an extend, with the saying ""we are what we eat"" -- But do we apply the same when it comes to media (people conversations, memes, news)  consumption and how that affects the make up of our mind/soul?

When I was younger I used to enjoy all those ""I am depressed"" memes and would say ""sameeee!"" in my mind a click ""like"" on the screen. But as I grew older I started to question how this constant ""stream feed of information"" and the affirmation was affecting my mindscape / self.  It's very likely if one subjects and surrounds themselves with media saying ""It's all depression's fault"" and ""You are uncapable because you're handicapped"" that even if you're not, you're likely to yield.  Same goes with all people who self diagnose as suffering from anxiety / adhd --- ""You didn't fail. It's just anxiety."" 

I believe that one point of being stoic is being able to have a certain degree of clarity on reality and yourself.  Most human problems have solutions as they mostly come from the human mind, however we humans are the only sources in the universe of ""logic errors"" meaning a problem that seems to have an inadequate / impossible solution yet we grade it as ""That's the solution."" such as saying "" 1+2 = 4"" , which we know is ""wrong."" --- Without enough clarity on reality and ourselves (to learn to accept blame, and let things go) we simply can accept wrong solutions to our problems. 

Anyhow, just wanted to see if someone had thought/came across similar life issue."

He made my life better as I made his and I am  incredibly grateful for the time we spent together.  
I knew that this day would come and I had used negative visualization to prepare myself for this, but I still feel like I was hit by a bus and I can't do anything but to feel extremely sad. When I was sad I used to just go to my dog but that is no longer an option.

1,"What are your go-to questions to ask yourself? Hi everyone, I'm new to stoicism and I'm making an effort to apply it throughout my day as well as I can. However, I sometimes notice I'm sort of searching for which principles to apply to a situation. For me, the easiest and most applicable so far is assessing how much control I really have over something. This applies to most things in some capacity.

Here are some questions I've been asking myself recently.

* How much control do I really have over X situation?
* What can I do moving forward that can influence the outcome of X situation?
* Which aspects of X situation are entirely out my control?
* Is undue suffering stemming from aspects that are out of my control?

These questions help me locate where I'm stationed internally when I'm feeling anxious/nervous/antsy/etc. Like sometimes I think I'm being stoic, but in reality I'm actually way downstream ruminating over things out of my control. And asking these questions helps reveal that to myself.  So, I was curious what others internal dialogue looks like when assessing a bothersome situation. Do you have a set sequence of questions you ask yourself to get to the bottom of something?"

*""But my leg is broken, I lost an athletic scholarship, and my future is ruined. How is that a choice?""* Does a broken leg inhibit your mind? Only if you let it. Do you need an athletic scholarship to improve yourself? No.

*""My spouse cheated on my and I'm heartbroken. How is that my choice?""* Does being the victim of infidelity make you less of a person? Only if you let allow it to.

*""I only have 6 weeks to live and I'm terrified, how could that possibly be a choice I'm making?""* Does impending mortality harm your soul? Only if that is your choice.

Your soul, mind, and will are unconquerable up until the moment you choose to let someone else affect them. Want to be invincible? Don't do that. It takes practice, but there's nothing stopping from achieving it except your own damn self.

*""If a person gave your body to any stranger he met on his way, you would certainly be angry. Why do you feel no shame in handing over your own mind to be confused and mystified by anyone who happens to verbally attack you?""* Enchiridion 28

Has anybody applied stoic principles to getting to sleep easier? I understand the noises of the environment are outside of my control but is there a reliable way to condition the automatic defense mechanism response to noise and actually fall asleep?

Or that this noble vintage is grape juice, and the purple robes are sheep wool dyed with shellfish blood. Or making love—something rubbing against your penis, a brief seizure and a little cloudy liquid. Perceptions like that—latching onto things and piercing through them, so we see what they really are. That’s what we need to do all the time—all through our lives when things lay claim to our trust—to lay them bare and see how pointless they are, to strip away the legend that encrusts them.”*  \- Marcus Aurelius"

1,"""A man who is not afraid is not aggressive, a man who has no sense of fear of any kind is really a free, a peaceful man."" - Jiddu Krishnamurti Just as all virtues are all connected together, and are all one in the same, it can be said that all fears are connected by the same thread and until all fear is extinguished it can return once again in a different form. It is perhaps the most fundamental emotion of any creature that wishes to survive another day to pasture, deeply rooted and imperative, fear will do anything in its power to keep itself alive in the mind of those who seek to challenge it. 

Which leads me to a crucial question - What is better, to overcome all fear and become Fearless, or to allow fear to persist in the mind while we attempt merely to tame it? Do we say that fear is unconquerable and we must pay taxes to the Emperor, or do we rebel and seek to fight an enduring battle to strike it out even if we may never win? At one point, for the first choice, we must believe it to be possible to live without fear while maintaining our human dignity. That the sage is not unattainable, but only rare to achieve, and accessible to us. For the second, we have to convince ourselves that living with a dangerous creature is more viable, and that we can somehow avoid its venomous bite.

As an aside, here's Krishnamurti's wikipedia entry if you wish to know more about his remarkable life as a philosopher of the 20th century: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiddu\_Krishnamurti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiddu_Krishnamurti) I find his ideas to be in line with a Stoic mindset, without mysticism, and purely driven by a sincere commitment to truth."

*Amidst the crashing world.""*

Rockstar Games' Red Dead Redemption 2 is a very cinematic game. At certain emotional or significant points of the story,  gameplay is suddenly accompanied by a song, usually as you travel from A to B to keep the atmosphere going. 

It works incredibly well. The first of these songs is Unshaken, by D'Angelo, and it's been in my head since the first time I heard it.

The quote above is the chorus, which is repeated like a mantra, and inspired by a quote from Sri Paramahansa Yogananda, “You must stand unshaken amidst the crash of breaking worlds.”

1,"Why isn't temporary abstinence a common practise in stoicism? I know that stoicism is all for moderation. But moderation is different for everyone and can be hard to figure out. Sure, drinking two cups of coffee a day might sound like moderation, but if you get a headache after not drinking it for four days, then you know that it isn't moderation.

Stoicism is largely about becoming the master of yourself so why isn't abstinence a common practise for self-control and self-discovery? We shouldn't rely on externals. We all know that, but we are often blind to our own flaws and addictions so abstinence would bring that needed clarity. 

We often realize the value of things when lost. That goes to pleasures also, but as in our need instead of value. If you want to become the master of yourself, to not be reliant on the externals to make you feel better, it would make sense for you to figure out what externals you rely on right now, right? 

So why isn't it common to do like a two-week abstinence period every year or something?"

1,"Stoicism for a Better Life - Weekly exercise (October 14) Hello there,

For this exercise, let us look once again outside our school of thought for some wise words. This is an excerpt from the book *Man's Search for Meaning* written by Viktor Frankl:

&gt;""Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way."" 

The words may be from outside our school, but the idea is one of the pillars of Stoicism: Making a distinction between what is dependent on us vs. what is not dependent on us. Acknowledging this line that separates these two realms is a core precept of the philosophy. Consequently, focusing our time and energy on the realm of that which is dependent on us is a core practice of the philosophy.

You have heard time and time again that Stoicism is a practical philosophy. In other words, it is a philosophy that is practiced through its application...not through memorizing its ideas and quotes. And practicing it means simply this: Apply your rational mind in the present moment....Apply your consciousness in the ""Here and Now""...Be present and mindful in your eternal sequence of present moments.

The Stoics define a free individual as one who owns their will. The only place you are entirely free is in your judgments, decisions and in your ability to manage how you are going to respond to any given situation...no matter what is happening around you. You are the only one who can enslave yourself to externals. 

No one can make you think that which you don't want to. They may be able to force your body to respond to external stimuli, but your mind is always free. **So as a practical exercise this week, when you feel trapped, forced or upset with externals, remind yourself this simple truth: No matter what is happening outside your mind, YOU (your thoughts, judgments and decisions) are ALWAYS yours and therefore ALWAYS free.**

Yet, oftentimes the opposite course happens. 

I think it’s not very wise to desire or seek friendships for any other reason than for the friendship itself. If you feel lonely, that is your perspective. If you find a friendship, it itself won’t end your perspective in the long run. That is up to you. So you’re seeking a friendship for the sheer fact that you feel lonely - when this is no cure. Perhaps in the short term you’ll feel better but not in the long run usually. That is just my view.

On a voyage when your boat has anchored, if you want to get fresh water you may pick up a small shellfish and a vegetable by the way, but you must keep your mind fixed on the boat and look around frequently in case the captain calls. If he calls you must let all those other things go so that you will not be tied up and thrown on the ship like livestock. That is how it is in life too: if you are given a wife and a child instead of a vegetable and a small shellfish, that will not hinder you; but if the captain calls, let all those things go and run to the boat without turning back; and if you are old, do not even go very far from the boat, so that when the call comes you are not left behind."

I have a lot of physical pain frequently for seemingly no reason. Coupled with that, I get furiously bitchy when I'm hurting, and feel really angry and depressed. 

I want to know how to elongate the time between stimulus and response... right now the pain can be so bad and I feel so angry that when friends and family speak to me I lash out at them before I can consciously consider the situation. There is so much passion there, I want some sort of buffer to not misdirect it at the people around me. I have been sitting down each day to consider my thoughts and feelings, but there is a great anxiety about hurting someone with my unpleasantness.

For instance, I'm losing motivation in my hobbies as I don't feel there is a end goal or permanent benefiting- I'm losing motivation to even put effort into writing full sentences and opting to just writing in one word answers. I'm on regular doses of medication that gives me energy and as much as that helps, I am left feeling guilty and all gains are for not owing to the drug. I'm trying to look at the issues I am having through the lense of stoicism and this is where this thread comes in. 

I've tried the eulogy exercise recommended in a past stickied thread, but I have no idea what I need or want to be fulfilled. Is it a lack of direction that is fueling this, or is it a warp of perspective? I just don't know how to get my life on track and live a humbling life that aligns to the principles of stoicism.

&gt;I still fall short of it through my own fault, and through not observing the admonitions of the gods, and, I may almost say, their direct instructions; that my body has held out so long in such a kind of life; that I never touched either Benedicta or Theodotus, and that, after having fallen into amatory passions, I was cured; and, though I was often out of humour with Rusticus, I never did anything of which I had occasion to repent; that, though it was my mother's fate to die young, she spent the last years of her life with me; that, whenever I wished to help any man in his need, or on any other occasion, I was never told that I had not the means of doing it; and that to myself the same necessity never happened, to receive anything from another; that I have such a wife, so obedient, and so affectionate, and so simple; that I had abundance of good masters for my children; and that remedies have been shown to me by dreams, both others, and against bloodspitting and giddiness...; and that, when I had an inclination to philosophy, I did not fall into the hands of any sophist, and that I did not waste my time on writers of histories, or in the resolution of syllogisms, or occupy myself about the investigation of appearances in the heavens; for all these things require the help of the gods and fortune. 

From Meditations, by Marcus Aurelius, Book I

In the last page, he was saying how his shortfallings is due to his own responsibilities and failures, and not the Gods. But he talks of nature and gods, I don’t get if he’s being sarcastic.

1,"A parent's death can be a gift to them Imagine for a moment that you are a parent and that your child dies just as they are approaching adolescence. Later you lament that a parent should never have to bury their child. For this is arguably the worst things that could happen to a parent. 
Now imagine a mystical being appears to you right after the death of your child and can go back and stop them from dying, or resurrect them. As a parent you might feel that this being has given you the greatest gift possible. 
Now what if you would have no memory of the child's death, that may be even better. What happens when you are on your death bead and you have now avoided the worst possible fate of a parent, the death of a child. But you do not remember, it does not make it any less true that you avoided this terrible fate.
If my logic is fair, then as a parent, when you die, you are now avoiding the worst fate possible, the death of a child. Therefore when you die as a parent, you are being given the best gift possible, dieing knowing that you did not have to see a child die.

1,"On Contentment Have been reading one Discourse each morning to really understand each, I rewrite them into a condensed form to ultimately get the gist so I can acquire some wisdom for the day. Here is today:

1.12 On Contentment

Someone is free if all that happens to him comes about in accordance with his choice and no one else is able to impede him - therefore, true education consists precisely in this: in learning to wish that everything should come just as it does. AS the one who ordained them has ordained. Both virtue and vice, summer and winter. He has granted us a body and its parts, companions to share and experiences to be felt. It is this order of things in mind that we should approach our education not as to change the existing order, but, things around us being as they are and as their nature dictates so that we for our part may keep our will in harmony with whatever comes to pass.  Where can you be hindered of contentment? In fact, if you are living you are able to accept everything with said contentment. Exile? No, just as Socrates for the part was not in prison because he was there willingly, making it a gift and good fortune. 

With regard to the body - when it comes to your reason, you're not inferior to the Gods nor do you fall short of them, because the greatness of soul is not measured by height or length, but by the quality of its judgments. Character and Virtue. You have nobility and greatness of mind to enable you to deal with every circumstance. Shouldn’t you be giving thanks to God/The Gods/The Universe/Nature for having enabled you to rise above everything that they have placed within your power and having you rendered accountable only for what is subject to your control? What is then in your control? Only the right use of your impressions.

1,"buying a new car turned my aim for perfection in an obsession, how would a stoic tackle this? What happened is as follows:

My car was about to have some maintenance done, but after thinking about what was wise my dad (ex mechanic) and me concluded that it would be wiser to buy something else. 

&amp;#x200B;

So first we looked around for a car of the same make as my current car. We looked at a number of cars, but all of them ended up not being good deals. There was a differente type of car on my list as well, but it took some persuasion to get my dad to take a look at those as well. 

  
We went to a local garage, met the man running it there and looked at the car. It all looked very good, and the shop gave a nice feeling. So we concluded: why look around any further, lets go for this one. So we did, payed a nice and honest price for it and all was well. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I since cannot stop looking for other versions of the same car. Just to check whether we actually had a good deal. I'm trying to figure out what trim level mine has, what it's supposed to have (the car was imported a few years ago, so trim might vary), and what differs. This turns into almost obsessive research.

&amp;#x200B;

I sometimes feel just happy with the choice i made, but it cannot stop aiming for perfection and doubting about the car we bought. In the end it probably was the best, cause it was close and the car looks good and has all the trim I need. Yet a few things make it differ to others on the market, and I cannot seem to stop trying to find reasons why the car is the way it is instead of just being happy with what it is.

He was not and killing them caused no reaction to him, they were just ants. Such is the death of men at the hand of God.

1,"A blessing in disguise - Seneca I have just stumbled accross a quote that summarizes the mentality that I ended up having in the most important but also the most anxious period of my life about 4 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""To reduce your worry, you must assume that what you fear may happen is certainly going to happen."" - Seneca

I was in a special program for two years, preparing for a national competition to enter the most selective universitiy programs in Europe. It was very much a hit or miss: if you fail, you lose 2 years and go to university back at level 0. If you win, you're really well off. I took the bet. 

But from day one my teachers told me I was worth nothing. I was bad at maths, philosophy, anything that was in the contest I was basically bad at. My teachers told me that I could only expect the lowest ranked school with my level. Those were the schools that basically nobody wanted because their added value isn't amazing compared to the 10+ hour workdays you pull for 2 years where you barely have any time to yourself and barely have weekends.

I still remember how I felt very clearly. I felt lost and one month before the exam I gave up. I had hopes of going to the best ranked schools, I even had their logos hung up on my door so that everytime I went to school, I was reminded of what the goal was. But suddenly, I lost all hope because essentially my teachers were right. I was so bad they would let me write math exams at home. It took me 1 to 2 straight days to barely complete an exam that usually took 4 hours. These exams were meant to be unfinishable within 4 hours for competition's sake but still 1 to two days was too much and I just acknowledged that.

At that point, I just decided that the worst would happen and made plans accordingly. I looked up where these low-ranked schools were and projected myself living in those cities. I just accepted what I was afraid of.

A little later, the contests started. It was horrible. I took all the contests because I still applied to the major schools. So I was writing exams for about 6 hours a day on average for a month. The only difference was that I gave up seeing it as a competition. I stopped caring and accepted that I was not good enough anyways to go to the best ones. All I did from that moment on was write what I knew in the exams, do my best and forget the rest. One of the exams we got was a past exam destined for people at the phd level, it's really that insane. I just wrote what I knew and went back to my hotel and stopped caring. I even dated one of the girls I was competing against actually.

What happened? It's the most unexpected things I ever experienced. One day, after about two months of waiting, the results finally came in. As soon as I saw the results, I rushed into my room, closed the door and cried. I was accepted in the top 5 and I was literally the best student of my whole school. Even the students who always had 100% at most exams didn't score as highly as I did. I was in shock.

The lesson I learnt from this is to accept the worst as if it was real and to just live with it. It took all my anxiety, my fears, everything away. It was a huge national competition, everybody was sweating, afraid, getting little sleep and here I was hopeless. I'm still quite amazed by it and I'm glad I stumbled accross Seneca's quote today because I sort of started forgetting about how important it is. Just remembering this took away my anxiety that I developed over the last week for no reason.

Wishing you guys all the best.

This quotation resonates with me, especially as a teacher. In the past, I’ve risked my Stoic practice becoming too self-centered, a constant turning inward. And while self-examination is at the core of what I practice, this quotation reminds me that self-examination is done so I might be useful to others, deal kindly with my fellow humans, and work toward a society that’s more wise and just.

1,"The power of solitude When I spent six months in solitary confinement, one of the men I look up to the most sent me a letter saying ""Some people will pay a lot of money just for some alone time at a retreat to work on themselves. You've been given this for free. Use it well."". And I did. I studied my books(the only Stoic text I had was Stockdale's *Philosophical Thoughts of a Fighter pilot* but I had some other good ones.), I worked out, and I meditated. Since my release I've sometimes found myself missing the isolation and alone time while getting caught up in all the random bullshit that comprises my day. After thinking about this for a while, another man I look up to a lot told me this: 

*""Men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the country, sea-shores, and mountains; and thou too art wont to desire such things very much. But this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men, f****or it is in thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself. For nowhere either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble does a man retire than into his own soul,*** *particularly when he has within him such thoughts that by looking into them he is immediately in perfect tranquility; and I affirm that tranquility is nothing else than the good ordering of the mind. Constantly then give to thyself this retreat, and renew thyself; and let thy principles be brief and fundamental, which, as soon as thou shalt recur to them, will be sufficient to cleanse the soul completely, and to send thee back free from all discontent with the things to which thou returnest.""  -* Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 4.3

We talk a lot about the Stoic value of self-reliance and being okay with being alone. These are important, because when you desire the company of others too much, you open yourself up to disappointment and may not function as well when you do not have it. Humans *are* social animals though and I'm not trying to downplay the importance of community at all, but I would argue that in order to be an effective member of any community, you need to be an effective individual. 

I would challenge you all to start taking some dedicated alone time daily, or at least weekly, and turn your attention inwards. This can be done during your normal wind-down time at night, but it can be done on your commute, in the shower, or while walking a pet. Put your devices away, get away from other people, get outside if you can, and spend some time getting to know yourself a little better. Journaling helps too.

1,"Stoicism vs Black Lives Matter It's incontrovertibly true that black lives matter, but a decentralized political organization calling itself ""Black Lives Matter"" has hijacked that phrase and I can't see how it's virtuous.

Stoics repeatedly counsel people to turn away from the passions and emotions which dictate their actions, but Black Lives Matter encourages the opposite, inculcating a deep anger and resentment towards police and government. The Stoics said that such approaches were ""against nature."" What they meant was that the emotions would cloud one's judgement, obscure the truth, and likely result in self-defeating actions.

Yes it's insanely controversial right now, but Stoics should stand up for what's right no matter the cost. Working class black neighborhoods have a high crime rate. Defunding police and alienating police from the neighborhoods they are supposed to protect is not going to help working class blacks; it's going to increase crime and keep those neighborhoods in poverty for years to come. That's an obvious outcome which reinforces the Stoic reliance on Reason over emotion.

Using Reason and ignoring emotion, we might be able to see that the most successful emancipation and ciivil rights movements of the previous century were led by Gandhi and MLK. If there is really something at stake here, nonviolence and reconciliation will obviously be far more effective at generating a desired outcome than looting and alienation. If we really want police brutality against blacks to end, let's have block parties where the police are invited, where they get to hang out with their fellow citizens they are assigned to protect.

Accomplished Stoics shouldn't get riled up in the midst of any of this. They should be a calm voice of reason and guide the different parties towards reconciliation. To the extent that one party or the other can't accept reconciliation, they're too emotional to create a beneficial outcome, and can be safely ignored."

1,"STOICISM AND PORN Hi, m19 here, I have been addicted to porn and masturbation since 11, this addiction got sick and scary perverted every time I fapped.

I know that I shouldn't put women on pedestal or like worship them, but my problem is that I can't seem to focus on myself.

I know that if i don't get that external validation or sex I will be craving more and more, so it's masturbation it's kind a escape to calm that inner hungry demon for few days.

I did cut all superflue things that can trigger my addiction or rise unnaturaly my dopamine, but I can seem to go more then 2 weeks.

I get burned up and get sad for little minimal things like a kid and escape from which things I don't have to masturbation.

I tried all the different approach, even knowledge itself can't seem to help me or prevent. 

It's getting worse and worse, how could Stoic approach this pleasurable bad but sweet voice suggesting self-destruction?

I have to die virgin with that crave cuz I can't get myself in long-term? And settle it down with short-term pleasure facing shame, guilt, anxiety ?"

1,"How do I stop craving sex and female affection so much? What’s the stoic approach? I’m a 20 year old male. When I was young I had terrible anxiety around women and I also didn’t have the best appearance so I got no female attention. I think I glowed up a lot physically and improved my social anxiety but now that sex is something that’s attainable, it’s all I think about and obsess over. I crave it and especially crave attention from women so much, over anything else. It’s not even that I feel horny, I just crave the attention like I would crave food if I was starving. 

What’s worse is that the craving feels urgent, it’s like I need to take advantage of my youth to make up for all the lost years of not getting sex and have as much as possible. I feel like time is running out and if I don’t I’ll regret it forever and have a midlife crisis. The virus has amplified everything because I obviously can’t really go out and meet new people, so I feel like I’m just sitting here wasting my 20s away. I see my friends who have girlfriends or many hook up options at all times and feel so much envy.

I’ve had sex with a few women in the last couple years since I’ve dealt with the issues I mentioned at the beginning and when I do I feel very at peace, but then if I go a long time the craving comes back. I feel like in an ideal world I’d be around women all the time and have sex every day. I want success so that I can attract more women. Even when I had a committed girlfriend id fantasize about other women all the time. I fantasize about it all the time still currently and when I’m in my imagination is the only time I feel peace. 

In real life I don’t act like a depraved desperate gross dude. In fact I’m very respectful and rarely make advances at women unless I get a clear sign that it’s what they want but I’m just describing what’s going on inside my head. I want to fix it cause it feels unhealthy but I don’t know how. What is the stoic approach to my situation? What would you say to me?"
1,"Happiness comes from within, but sometimes it needs a bit of help to come out. I see practicing gratitude recommended as the way to go when someone feels down in life or is sad. If you can read this, it means you have internet access, and most likely also a roof over your head and can afford food, so you don't have to worry about tomorrow. But even with basic needs checked and a good career, I feel empty inside, like something is missing. I don't have wants beyond what is necessary and I know that pursuing useless (and a lot of times expensive) things is a game that too many people play, ignoring the fact that the time traded for earning that money is forever gone, and the joy that comes from owning whatever they now have lasts only a couple of days. So, I don't think it's about anything material, rather about discontent with my being.  I know that joy is a state of mind, but I can't seem to find a lasting way to implement this in my life. I can't recall the last time I was happy for more than a couple of days. How do you handle contentment with your life on a daily basis?"
1,"What is justice? I have read that the Stoics referred to justice simply as kindness, and fairness in our actions. But obviously In today’s world, justice means a lot more than that.

1,Some stoic advice from “death” in the manga dorehedoro. 
1,"Music is a painting of life. I came across this music in youtube from one of my favorite Anime, called, the music is called [Requiem of Silence](https://youtu.be/2-LQqnyNYiQ).

Now this post is not about Anime or anything. But when I listened to the music, I suddenly reminded me of life. The music did not feel vigorous or energetic, it felt calm, accepting, melancholic. The music obviously had a sad tone. But it did not felt sad, it did not feel dark or anything, but if felt like the silent and solitude acceptance of one's fate.

And this music made me imagine of Life as a whole. It is filled with suffering, with pain, and with misfortune. But this is Life, and this is our fate to go through this. This music was like a painting that reminded me of what to come to my life. Today, my Mother felt sick and I took care of her. I'm then reminded of the impermanence of things and Epictetus' teachings appeared in my mind. But nevertheless, I knew that if my mother were to vanish, I will feel terribly awful. The mere thought of that hurted me.

It's like what Socrates said:

&gt;""**If all misfortunes were laid** in one common heap whence **everyone** must take an **equal** portion, most people would be contented to take their own and depart.""

And it was at this moment, listening to this melody, that I learned the beauty of music, not just a form of entertainment, but a means to communicate ideas that cannot be expressed through words. 

Everyone has their own predisposition so I'm sure if you might not hear what I hear, but you can still try listening to the music."

1,"A Stoic Answer to Toxic Masculinity: 
I was having a discussion with a friend about my Stoic practice when my friend mentioned how Stoicism might feed into Toxic Masculinity, specifically the way my friend believed Stoicism and T.M. both advise people to overcome or suppress their emotions. 

Thankfully, it was clear this was an opportunity for me to remind myself that no one does or thinks wrong intentionally, and that every tension tension can be an opportunity to teach, learn, and grow. 

We continued talking, and I drew the distinction between being stoic and being Stoic. 

Then, I described the Stoic practice of identifying and examining the first movements of the soul, in order to better understand the roots of our passions, and to relate rationally and healthily to our emotions. 

It was then it hit me that Stoicism has been providing an answer for thousands of years to the type of lower-case stoicism prevalent in our culture. 

Practicing Stoics are intimately acquainted with their emotions. They can read their emotions the way seasoned mariners understand the creating waves and the ebb and flow of the tides. 

So rather than feed into unhealthy emotional suppression found all too often in our young men (I see this among my high school students), a Stoic approach finds a way out by means of a way through. 

“The obstacle is the way”, as Marcus would put it. 

Thank you for reading,

1,Does stoicism and Christianity agree      Are there any big differences can you be a Christian stoic?
1,"Looking for guidance and explanations regarding identifying unique spiritual basic necessities. This is something I have come across in the book ""Your users manual"". So I'm just reading ""Your users manual"" by Anderson Silver and I was wondering if I could have some insight and guidance on the part where he lays out some guidelines to help you with understanding and deciding what your unique spiritual basic necessities should be (he previously explains that our physical necessities and purpose from this universe are one of the same, to simply hydrogenate carbon dioxide for the planet).

I'm having trouble with number 5 here. How can I decide I necessity which isn't influenced by career, materials or loved ones? I was going to try to pick productivity and researching more on a subject to help me better my career but he states that shouldn't be the case. I guess I need a little help on knowing how to find a necessity which is within me, and ""completing"" it daily. Could anyone help explain it more to me? Thank you. 

The guidelines are as follows :
1. Necessities must be decided objectively by you, and not imposed on you by anyone else, whether it'd parents, TV, Buddha or Seneca.

2. Make sure your necessities are realistic and achievable within that current time (he uses the example of wanting to help starving children in Africa but not being able to due to logistics and finance. 

3. Every day is death, live day by day. Your necessities can not be something to be completed in the future, it must be something to be completed daily. 

4. Your necessities are yours, cannot be linked to the universes will or fate. Cannot be linked to anything external including loved ones, careers or materials. Must be 100% subject to your choices and actions. 

5. Necessities must be deeply rooted within you. When revalidating them over time they should not be constantly changing. 

6. Make a list of all your old necessities to identify falsehoods you used to believe in and better identify truer necessities now."

1,"The Courage to Be Disliked - Ichiro Kishimi, Fumitake Koga : One every aspiring Stoic should read. After Reading this book i couldn't help myself from posting this on this sub. This book is based on the works of Adler who was contemporary of Jung and  Freud  . The story goes as discussion between a philosopher and youth. This books touches the Stoic Idea's so well and simple it makes it easy to understand. Youth's questions are spot on , and answers are so insightful . When i started out Stoicism i had so many doubts and questions, they all answered in this book :  

some Idea's on the books are given below : 

1. “A healthy feeling of inferiority is not something that comes from comparing oneself to others; it comes from one’s comparison with one’s ideal self.”
2. “The courage to be happy also includes the courage to be disliked. When you have gained that courage, your interpersonal relationships will all at once change into things of lightness.” 
3. “It’s that you are disliked by someone. It is proof that you are exercising your freedom and living in freedom, and a sign that you are living in accordance with your own principles.” 
4. “No matter what has occurred in your life up to this point, it should have no bearing at all on how you live from now on.’ That you, living in the here and now, are the one who determines your own life.” 
5. “Who ultimately is going to receive the result brought about by the choice that is made? When the child has made the choice of not studying, ultimately, the result of that decision—not being able to keep up in class or to get into the preferred school, for instance—does not have to be received by the parents. Clearly, it is the child who has to receive it. In other words, studying is the child’s task.” 

Hope you most of view read this book and change life."

1,What do you reflect on each day in your daily journal (for those people that journal daily) ? 
1,"A chronic disease that makes me forget, and destroys my ruling faculty with every day passing Zdarova gentlemen,  
Wanted to share something with you dudes of stoicism, as we are brothers of a deeper understanding of life, and pretty much the living of real actual peace of mind.  
You might understand.

  
Life hasn't been easy, but it has been the life that was granted, climbed and improved, and stoicism has always been a massive pillar since I discovered it and realized how golden truth is, since back over 2 years ago. So no matter what honestly, life was pretty peachy regardless of what went on,  
power of our ruling faculty is insane. Truly the only thing within our power 100%.  
Life's golden with stoicism in it, combined with the modern life and modern issues, you basically live the god mode given by god itself. I still am amazed by that.  
I'm 20 years old, young and fresh, climbing and rising into life. Or was at least, until the thing occured.

A certain situation happened, a massive pizdets.  
I've been having a massive decline in health from the past year and a half, and a massive critical one going straight down from a little bit over half a year ago,  
a combination of Chronic Autoimmune diseases that were neglected and undiagnosed for too long and had their fair damage and more of unknown too, currently fresh in the long waiting process of getting even an answer with how processes go.  
Treatment is unlikely for the time being, especially with epidemic stealing all the resources from the already broken down medical care. And as far as my knowledge in base medicine, brain is very tough to treat, unless it decides to support itself once the disease is off, but that isn't the case alas.  
The local medicare is absolute garbage, neglected and pathetic, so that was expected, as I come from a modernized shithole. In the most truthful wording.

Basically, a collection of piled up diseases ended up damaging me in such a way that life hasn't been the life I knew ever since,  
Physically destroyed, walk like a zombie due to the pain and weakness fatigue, lost entire body shape, hair mildly sheds, barely eat, barely sleep, senses broken with smell and taste fading away at times, vision too sometimes.  
But that was the LEAST of my worries. With my realization of life today, that's all just external bullshit.

The biggest issue was

The cognitive decline, that brought down my ability to communicate, simply destroyed my speech analyze and talk speed, the ability to think in a normal tempo and performing the usual thinking existing tasks, that was just the start that went on rather slowly but launched itself fast.  
Started lightly, and didn't mean much back in the day, it was just here and there that I was having difficulties to suddenly normally talk without just stopping and staring at nothing, and other bullshit that ended up leading to the current state.  


  
Leading on,  
I had to quit university courses, quit the job, due to severe memory problems that simply had too many gaps for me to even complete an assignment, or study a course,  
communication with people went declining rapidly, as I noticed that suddenly I wasn't able to speak or even let my mind flow around people, and talking and thinking along the action. So all contacts were cut too, I was not capable of it efficiently.  
The physical and cognitive symptoms dropped that bad that I became dependent on my family for assistance, as I struggle to move much myself, the pain and the weakness is mad.  
Barely eat, barely sleep due to weird uncontrollable nightmares that are hard to explain to what they may be related.  
A major part of all that I knew, and was, was erased slowly and unsteadily,  
from memories, abilities and just living.  
Used to be a man on a purpose, that I understood recently, was god given to me.  
Practiced complementary medicine after I was lucky to be educated with such rare knowledge, and treated many close to me and was about to open a business of my own, the Purpose included all I loved and was proficient in life. All god gave me.  
Lived in a shithole, but loved people and loved life for what there still was in it, beauty.  
I was gifted with Charisma, amazing improvisation skills, natural leadership, quick thinking and simply a flow of a man, of life and nature, and when I combined it with stoicism and god of nature, I was released into true me.  
A rare thing to achieve at such age, I couldn't be more thankful for such blessing.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll cut the govno in the middle, straight to current truth and reality.

In the current state, I suffer from real bad cognitive problems, that destroy my ability to think rationally, makes my information processing very slow and lacking rationale due to the inability to think more than just plain simply likea  child (which is the best comparison for it), I cannot read without getting a migrane from the inability to process what I even read like it just doesnt work, and a severe memory loss that makes me forget 90% of what happened yesterday, let's not talk about what even happened before yesterday.  
Memory loss on the degree of the New Information Input loss mostly, but still has the erasing abilities of the past as well, some of the old memories and knowledge remained, along with practical but accessing it is horribly painful and hard (physically) for some reason.  
I do my best with try to re enter into Meditations and the Discourses which led my life, and were erased and are erased with every day from my mind, (I have notes taped all over my room to assist that, but it fails too. I just don't recognize the written, or its context.)

With each passing day, I lose myself slowly and unsteadily, there are days that I forget where I am upon awakening, and generally I don't remember much how I even look without looking in the mirror.   
I don't recognize the books on my shelf, nor places, nor memories, nothing.  
Every experience related to external things like, reading a book, visiting a place, smelling something, just looking outside the window for the same familiar look,  
every single time it feels like a first experience, or second experience at least. Sometimes it differs, some things I used to do, see and live daily are every time new first time experience feeling like.

Brain just can't access this information for some reason, so damn empty inside I feel the vaccuum.  
While back in the day, I've had the entire stoic 101 in my mind, practiced, lived, breathed.  
It also went away in the process of the mind wipe.  


So I was shocked recently, when I opened my journals and notes that I had over the progress of climbing and improving of myself, I usually couldn't read them because my brain just didn't get the context, but recently I managed to sit on them a bit, and realized...  
I have lost all what I was made into, and lost it in a way I am really unable to recover due to just how it is medically. Brain is unable.  
I discovered that the way I handled life back then, was actually how and for what I was made, a man on his purpose, a legend, so I see and recall with tough effort,  
I have lost my ability for rationale, and I didn't even notice it, I became easier to manipulate by the scarcity mindset feminine surrounding I am sadly stuck in, for the years being which was the part of the endgame process to change.  
Along with other info from the journals as of life perspectives, books, business and stuff that now when my eyes pass on it, I really don't understand who even wrote this shit. Is it even mine?  


I am simply, a wiped, and slowly forgetting myself, man.  
The destroyed and thrown external life I built, doesn't matter, that's just theories and external shit,  
but my mind is losing itself,  
I knew that by over half a year already, but now it's a real official realization.  
With each day passing, my reality perception is being erased, not to talk about rationale,  
I lose the ability to differ between good or bad or just what it is because I am consumed into everything outside.

Currently, I am living on the pure empty mind of just vital things (barely), and emotional impulsiveness due to the absolute lack of any base rationale in my mind that sticks, and doesn't vanish to sudden burst of cognitive delusions that arise due to the condition.  


Can't call it scary, because I can't even feel or analyze emotions normally,  
just like a person I recall, that has dementia, they can't ACKNOWLEDGE their decline, they just sit and rot. I can't recognize it is abnormal anymore, due to how long of a time has passed (which I don't even know how long it has been, every week feels in my mind like last year, I remember none of it.)  
Without my old notes that I wrote, I wouldn't even know and acknowledge all that.  
Especially that I am all alone in this, fading. Family struggles to acknowledge this due to their own issues, femininity tends to care more about itself.  
 But regarding that I don't care much, since comfort / validation or whatever other approvals people may express, wouldn't change reality and the facts of what's happening.  


Imagine losing the only thing you truly had control over, 100% control over it.  
Your ability, and will, for making judgements, decisions and rational thinking and simply understanding of impressions in life.  
That was the one and true thing I have had, which has already got wiped partially, and is headed downwards as the time goes.

&amp;#x200B;

  
I saved a page, I don't recall why even, but I read it again recently. As Epictetus mentioned the topic of the open door, and how a man has the power to decide, even in that subject that when he no longer sees the game of life beneficial to him (whether rationally, or not), he has the power in himself to decide and not participate in it.  
But simply and technically said,  
until god doesn't give you the signal that it's time, and you have finished your time on your post (purpose) that you were assigned for in this life, treat yourself well and live life with good endurance.

The story of the athlete that lost his genitals, the man that his life was his atheletic image even if external, it was part of his purpose, his post in life, being a man of olympics,  
so him losing his genitals, part of what he was, was a fair reason for him at least, to leave his life.

I digested my current reality, that I keep forgetting every single day, I made a long struggled written thinking.  


After losing the base of what I was made for, my god given purpose that was based on what was within me, my character. A cripple.  
The loss of my inner existence, that led to the loss of what was basically me and my life, just like the athlete's balls that he lost, I lost my character, my ability to communicate, my charisma, my mind.   
All wiped, slowly...  


Honestly, even THAT.  I gave up after a while of painful struggle against it, unable to believe that the only thing I had control over was slowly decaying.  
But I gave it up, it was lost, I didn't need it no more because it wasn't here.  
I thought, the ONLY thing I truly needed, was my Rational Thinking, my Ruling Faculty.  
I believed it will truly be that one last thing that will remain and stick, and I would tend that garden.  


I was wrong gentlemen.  
My ruling faculty, and rationale are long ago already out of normal perspectives of existence.  
They still function, but not in a state where a person can be preceived logical.

A signal that it's time, that it's my role that was given by god, finished?  
Who knows man.  


Would be cool to exchange a few words about such circumstance with Epictitues tbh, although I probably know his answer already. 

&amp;#x200B;

Marcus: As humans, we all share the same fate. All of us will die, and all of us will be forgotten. 

Commodus: But... I don't want to be forgotten..

Marcus: Of course you don't! But ask yourself this, my son: If everyone else is also forgotten, what are you really missing out on?

Commodus: Nothing.. I guess..

Marcus: That's right. Nothing. 

Marcus: Like every young boy, you want to compete with others, and become the best. Other people don't consider you the greatest emperor yet, so death is a problem for you. That's completely natural - every young boy thinks like that.

Marcus: Once you grow older, you will realize that nothing in this world lasts forever, and that we all share the same fate. At that point, death will no longer be a problem for you."

""A noble man compares and estimates himself by an idea that is higher than himself; and a mean man, by one lower than himself. The one produces aspiration; the other ambition, which is the way in which a vulgar man aspires.""

I had heard this attributed to Marcus Aurelius and have found myself spending a lot of time thinking about it and its distinctions between aspiration and ambition.

However, I cannot seem to find where in Meditations it is from, or if it is the product of Marcus Aurelius at all. I have purchased a 1940's copy of the Casaubon translation, but it will not arrive for a few weeks still.

A bit of digging through Google attributes the same quotation to Henry Ward Beecher,  an American pastor from the 1800s.

1,"""Man, what fault have you to find with your nature?"" - In which Epictetus goes full No-Shave Sometimes living according to Nature was taken to its extreme logical conclusions by the philosophers. To the point wher Epictetus spends an entire chapter rebuking a man who plucks his hairs to look handsome to women.

[From book 3 of Discourses.](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0236%3Atext%3Ddisc%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D1)

&gt; Are you man or woman? Man. Adorn yourself then as man, not as woman. Woman is naturally smooth and delicate; and if she has much hair (on her body), she is a monster and is exhibited at Rome among monsters. And in a man it is monstrous not to have hair; and if he has no hair, he is a monster: 'but if he cuts off his hairs and plucks them out, what shall we do with him? where shall we exhibit him? and under what name shall we show him? I will exhibit to you a man who chooses to be a woman rather than a man. What a terrible sight! There is no man who will not wonder at such a notice. Indeed I think that the men who pluck out their hairs do what they do without knowing what they do. Man what fault have you to find with your nature? 

It was easier to think this way back then, wasn't it? Today this would be criticized immediately for being phobic of a few things and promoting dangerous stereotypes about masculinity. Perhaps some people will approve, some will say the times have changed, and that beauty and hair is only a preferred indiferent. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Whom do you wish to please? The women? Please them as a man. Well; but they like smooth men. Will you not hang yourself? and if women took delight in catamites, would you become one? Is this your business? were you born for this purpose, that dissolute women should delight in you?  

He brings things back to the subject of social pressure and how it shouldn't affect the man of reason. Easily we could fall into trends and be mere puppets of fashion. Is a man only a man if he serves the eyes of women? The inverse is easily just as important."

1,"Dealing With An Enemy. Advice Needed. Hi everyone.

I’m a teenager and I’m having trouble with an enemy of mine.

He was always known as the school bully, but a year or so ago we got into a big fight (I didn’t start it) that ended in me beating him up in front of a lot of people. He’s 2/3 years older than me and he has a lot of gangster friends, who were pissed (but that’s not really important)

He left the school a few months later. However, he still sends hate mail to me at times and my friends often play with him which upsets me. Moreover I’m afraid he’ll come to my house and hurt me because he has guns and knives (don’t know if they’re real though because a friend told me)

I’m thinking about him all the time and it really upsets me. Because I fear that I might end up facing him off and getting humiliated and hurt (he doesn’t know where I live and we’re in different schools so I know this is unrealistic). Moreover my friends talk about him in front of me and the memories of his insults come back which disturbs me.

What should I do? I’m lost. I’m only 14 years old and I’m struggling with this."

I should let go when the time is right. So yes, I do allow myself to be swept up by this wave of life and fate, and I released my fears and inhibitions today. I think fondly of Victor Frankl's quote “When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves.” We cannot stop life from making us face the cruel world or taking away safety from us but we can always choose to see everything instead as a learning point to move forward.

1,"On politics and opinion (Discourses 1.5) These days it can be very hard to avoid the discussion of politics, and it can be frustrating when friends or loved ones don't see things the same way as us. It can be commendable to participate in politics in a virtuous manner, but when doing so as a Stoic you must take care to not make assumptions about your opponent(s), specifically the assumption that ""If I converse with them long enough, eventually they will see things my way."". That is a terrible trap to fall into, and can quickly become a endless loop of heated anger and frustration. Consider the first part of Discourses 1.5: 

*""It is said that there are those who will oppose very evident truths, and yet it is not easy to find a reason which may persuade such a person to alter his opinion. This may arise neither from his own strength, nor from the weakness of his teacher; but when a man becomes obstinate in error, reason cannot always reach him.""*

""Evident truths"" applies to both subjective truths(politics, science, health, you name it) and objective truths(although it's another debate entirely whether there are any objective truths). 

If you choose to get into a political discussion with someone on the other side, my advice would be to speak your piece, listen to theirs, and change the topic. Because even if you ""verbally joust"" flawlessly, even if you perfectly point out all their fallacies while defending you're own, even if *they actually start to see your point*, chances are they'll just double down on what they know and what's comfortable to them, and you'll end up wasting your breath.

Go out and vote though. Cheers."

1,"We are made for one another Hi! I am relatively new to the stoic philosophy, but I wanted to share a new word that I learned today by Marcus Aurelius. The word is sympatheia and it focuses on the fact we people are made to serve each other. 

We cannot control everything that happens around us, but we can control how we interact with the divisive and turbulent time, and for Aurelius this was to focus on sympatheia, we are all part of the same, an interconnected cosmo. We all exist, think and breath as human beings and are at this point the same. In sympatheia I got reinforced in the mindset of being present and focused on humans when so many things seems out of control. What we can control is how we interact with one another and be willing to be present for somebody else.

Hope this helped somebody else as well."

1,This One Habit Is Holding You Back 
1,"Could This Be A Proof That God Exists??? The topic about the existence of a God is indeed very debatable, but lately I've been thinking about it and I came up with something I believe to be a 'logical proof' of God's existence.

I never used to believe in magic, soccery or things of that sort, but then not believing in these things but believing in a supreme God pretty makes for an imbalance in the scale of things.

In 2015, I was undertaking a training at a place not so far from my home. on my way to work on a particular day, I noticed a huge gathering. On getting close to find out the cause, I saw a man in the middle of the crowd performing what I called 'tricks'. He did several things including smoking a cigarette and making the smoke come out of a teddy bear's ear. It wasn't difficult finding a way to rationalize all he was doing but then he did this very one thing I could not comprehend how. There was an empty carton he placed on the ground, I was certain that the carton was empty, he then called on one of us who was watching to place a red piece of fabric over the empty carton, after this, he asked the man to name anything that he wants. The man mentioned that he didn't have a phone and so he needed one. This performer then instructed the man to stretch out his hands in the air to ""catch"" mobile phones.
The instruction was this "" let 5 Samsung phones, 5 Nokia phones, and 5 LG phones come out of the shop of that fat woman who doesn't give her brother or sister anything"" so, This man caught five (5) Samsung phones, 5 LG phones and 5 Nokia phones. ( Apparently when he was catching, it all seemed he was catching air but the man who was performing instructed him to release the empty hand on the red piece of fabric which was over the carton). To cut the long story short, when the fabric was later removed, the carton contained exactly 15 phones (5 LG phones, 5 Nokia phones and 5 Samsung phones).

What could this be? I pondered and up till date I still cannot explain it. But that's not the point.

Just recently, the thought came to mind again and I decided to contemplate on it. I'm from Nigeria, and in this part of the world, majority of people are very religious, they worship all sorts of things and it is very common to hear things such as "" This and this is happening to you because there is someone in your vilage who has done so and so"" meaning that events are being manipulated by someone against another's favor. it has even become a popular saying that people generally joke with when one experiences an unfortunate event, people say ""your vilage people have come for you""

This is still not my point... But then my point is, "" if external events can be manipulated to work against someone, can't they also be manipulated in favor of one? And if both cases are possible, what forces are in charge?

A few months ago, I took some time contemplating God's existence and I came to see God as 'the impartial judge between man and nature'. So I concluded that under God's supreme rule, man cannot cheat nature and neither can nature cheat man and everything that happens naturally is fair game. But what about those things that happen out of the ordinary?

There's a Bible story about a man named Job. This man was described as a just and faithful man- a good man. According to the story, Certain events were manipulated by the 'devil' against this man. As a result, he lost his possessions, his kids and became seriously plagued. The lesson at the end was that after loosing those things, he didn't loose his good will- he remained faithful until the end and he was rewarded.

Of course, The story of Job is a proof of what the stoics teach that external events cannot affect our will and that good and bad is only found in our choices. But then, does it still remain fair game when these events are manipulated in an unatural way? And if what physics teaches is true that ""to every action there's an equal but opposite reaction"" then this force behind manipulating events unjustly ought to have an opposite that is capable of balancing the scales.

Supposing the force behind this unjust manipulation of events is 'the devil' isn't this a proof that the just force is God? Isn't it consistent with reason that people have such a God to turn to when external things are manipulated unjustly?

I'd like to hear your thoughts on this."

1,"A Stoic approach to a toxic father? 21yo M living at home with parents until finished college.

How would you approach having a toxic father? To elaborate why I would categorize him as toxic.

- Never present in my life as a youth.

- Alcoholic in denial

- Manipulative and Childish

- Irresponsible (I often had to clean up his messes as a child)

- Physically and Emotionally Abusive when I was a child. When confronted about this claims I'm overreacting and he was a bit rough but abuse abusive. I differ in opinion.

- Refuses to change in any way, paints people as trying to control him if they ask. He refuses to allow anyone be the boss of him. Smh

- Despite all this paints himself as the victim because I don't love him, I've made it clear I want to but I need him to work on himself.

To sum up, I have a severe hatred of this man. I feel robbed of a father and all the traits which I would have attained with proper parenting. For example I had a subconscious attraction to very toxic relationships most of my life, to this day I get teary eyed when I see a father play with his son. I dont understand what I did to this man to deserve this and worry the damage done will last until the day I die. What life could i have lived if this didnt happen?

1,"I don't belive in good and evil. Should I?  

&gt;“When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are unnatural.”

&amp;#x200B;

This is the Marcus Aurelius quote that hits my in the feels lately. To me, it is the long, and more fleashed out version of ""be kind to everyone you meet"", kinda. But I just realised, part of his reasoning is because they can't tell good from evil, and he has seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil.  So here is the problem, although I realise that the wrongdoes has a nature related to my own, we are similar, I don't acknowledge evil and good as forces of nature (or people if you view them as seperate). I don't belive the neo-natzi is evil. I belive they have a very different set of belifs from what I have. I don't belive a catastophe is evil. I belive it has a lot of bad consequenses, but in its self a flood/bomb/fire/etc. can not be evil. ""It is stupidity, not evil"" is one of my favorite sayings. At the same time I don't belive in good. I belive it is a part of the language as a word with a descriptive meaning, but not as a concept of itself. It is all in the eye of the beholder. For example, I give money to charity every month, even though I am a student. I don't belive this is good. It's more of a necessity for comfortable life of my conscience. I can contribute with something, therefore I do. Same reason as to why I am a vegetarian. I don't belive Mother Theresa was good, I belive she did what she found to be right, just like the neo-natzi. 

I think the meaning of the verse still stands, but the reasoning puzzels me. I do belive that you can hold two non-compatible opinoions at the same time. Like, I don't belive in fate, but I love ""amor fati"". I don't think the world as deterministic as the original stoics ones did, but I do belive in cause, effect and consequenses. Could this be somewhat the same with evil and good? What are your thoughts on this? Do you belive in good and evil? Why/why not?"

He accepted that he was going to probably spend the rest of his life in prison and decided to do a noble thing. 
    Now I know that’s not the whole movie nor is it all there is to Andy but he took what others would have moaned and groaned about and made the best of it and left Shawshank in better condition (save the wardens office) then when he came in. We could all learn from Andy."

The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength.”

1,"The Rider and The Horse I started The Laws of Human Nature today and I came across an analogy about rationality that I thought you guys might appreciate as much as I did (apologize for formatting, on mobile):

    “The horse is our emotional nature continually impelling us to move. This horse has tremendous energy and power, but without a rider it cannot be guided; it is wild, subject to predators, and continually heading into trouble. The rider is our thinking self. Through training and practice, it holds the reins and guides the horse, transforming this powerful animal energy into something productive.

    The one without the other is useless. Without the rider, no directed movement or purpose. Without the horse, no energy, no power. In most people the horse dominates, and the rider is weak. In some people the rider is too strong, holds the reins too tightly, and is afraid to occasionally let the animal go into a gallop. The horse and rider must work together.

    This means we consider our actions beforehand; we bring as much thinking as possible to a situation before we make a decision. But once we decide what to do, we loosen the reins and enter action with boldness and a spirit of adventure. Instead of being slaves to this energy, we channel it. This is the essence of rationality”

1,"In light of the prejudice seen in the world at the moment, I found this quote very topical. ***“IF what philosophers say of the kinship between God and men be true, what has any one to do, but, like Socrates, when he is asked what countryman he is, never to say that he is a citizen of Athens, or of Corinth, but of the universe? For why, if you limit yourself to Athens, do you not farther limit yourself to that mere corner of Athens where your body was brought forth? Is it not, evidently, from some larger local tie, which comprehends not only that corner, and your whole house, but the whole country of your fathers, that you call yourself an Athenian, or a Corinthian? He then, who understands the administration of the universe, and has learned that the principal and greatest and most comprehensive of all things is this vast system, extending from men to God; and that from Him the seeds of being are descended, not only to one’s father or grandfather, but to all things that are produced and born on earth; and especially to rational natures, as they alone are qualified to partake of a communication with the Deity, being connected with him by reason; why may not such a one call himself a citizen of the universe? Why not a son of God? And why shall he fear anything that happens among men? Shall kinship to Cæsar, or any other of the great at Rome, enable a man to live secure, above contempt, and void of all fear whatever; and shall not the having God for our maker, and father, and guardian, free us from griefs and alarms?”***

1,"Becoming a master in the art of making friendships In Moral letters to Lucilius, Letter 9. On philosophy and friendship, Seneca provides a quick recipe to becoming a master of making friends - “to love”.

&gt;But he need never lack friends, for it lies in his own control how soon he shall make good a loss. Just as Phidias, if he lose a statue, can straightway carve another, even so our master in the art of making friendships can fill the place of a friend he has lost. If you ask how one can make oneself a friend quickly, I will tell you, provided we are agreed that I may pay my debt at once and square the account, so far as this letter is concerned. Hecato, says: ""I can show you a philtre, compounded without drugs, herbs, or any witch's incantation: 'If you would be loved, love.'"" Now there is great pleasure, not only in maintaining old and established friendships, but also in beginning and acquiring new ones.

While this is indeed a great advice, I’m not sure it covers the entire art. What are other simple and effective advice you can share to becoming a master in making friends?"

1,"Stoicism for a Better Life - Weekly exercise (October 7) Hello there,

For this exercise, let us look at an excerpt from Epictetus' Discourses I 6-1&amp;2:

&gt;""Show me someone who isn't a slave! One is a slave to lust, another to greed, another to power, and all are slaves to fear...No servitude is more abject than the self-imposed."" 

Amor Fati...most of us have heard this core Stoic precept already, right? Well you may be surprised to know that the term was actually coined by Nietzsche. Nietzsche was known for a lot of things including wrongly being associated with the Nazis (it was his sister who repackaged some of his work after his death), having the best moustache of any philosopher ever (yes I stand by this claim) and going completely bonkers at the end of his life. How bonkers? Oh boy...he lost his mind completely...and I mean completely, to the point where he was feasting on his own feces (a disease known as Coprophagia ...it is a behaviour that can manifest itself in the terminal stages of a schizophrenic patient).

But before his mental illness took over, Nietzsche wrote some of the most intricate and insightful works on the human condition. He was not a Stoic, but anyone who's read his work can pick up on the Stoic undertones. Moreover, he talks about the Stoics and their indifference to all that happens and summarized this approach with the words *Amor Fati* which is now part of the Stoic lexicon.

Our Stoic guides urge us to take this a step further. Instead of simply accepting what happens, they urge us to actually *enjoy* what has happens (no matter how ""bad"") because it is part of the same universal reason that made you and gave you your consciousness.  *Amor Fati* It's not just accepting fate, it is loving everything that happens. **So as a practical exercise this week, try and find a way to love all that happens to you, no matter how unpleasant it may be.** Because remember, the same universal reason, the same sequence of cosmic events that made that thing happen, also gave you life and awareness and consciousness to observe and experience it.

Let me know your insights on this exercise. It's not an easy one, but can be a very rewarding one.

1,"Using Stoicism to help cope with an injury Hi all, I injured my back around a year ago and have been going through various types of rehab ever since, I wanted to get your opinions of how you can apply Stoicism to help manage the mental challenges of dealing and coming to terms with an injury?

Bit of a context on mine and how I've shaped my mindset; the cause of the injury is still unknown to me but all signs point to an incorrect deadlift. I went to a pretty dark place early on when I realized this wasn't something I couldn't shake off in a week or so and be back to full fitness any time soon. I was initially frustrated, annoyed and feeling sorry for myself. Around and around I went.

I had started studying Stoicism before the injury by a few months and felt if I could ever shift my mindset into acceptance and tranquility with what I was going through then some of the Stoic principles could certainly help. 

I will just say this may sound rather dramatic but for me, this injury has been a huge part of my life for the past year (and still going).

- I learnt to take more for granted, like going for a walk. By walking I could take in the surrounding countryside or unique architecture that in the past, on the same street, I might not have taken in fully.
- I really tried hard to separate my mind from my body, in a sense that my injury is physical, and doesn't affect my mind, my character and my will to overcome it. It's enough that my body has suffered an injury, I need my mind to remain strong. 
- Time is a healer. When the medicines prescribed seem to do nothing or the physio sessions seem to be going nowhere, I kept telling myself, give it time, I will eventually get better.
- I have to be indifferent to keeping fit and active. It's a hobby of mine and something I enjoy but there are heaps of other beautiful things you can take up and do in your leisure
- Controlling the emotions. Asking myself does getting annoyed, frustrated and upset give me more options? No, that road leads to a dead end, where trying to remain upbeat takes me down a road of recovery, I may not see the end but I sure know it's a more productive direction. Moving forwards is better than not moving at all. 
- Shifting my perspective on the whole thing. Sure the injury is stopping me from working out but in the meantime I can learn about the way the back muscles and spine is made up which once I'm back exercising I can utilize the new knowledge I know and try prevent injury again in the future 
- Shrink my goals; instead of going from injured&gt;to fully back in the gym, I've learnt to accept smaller steps. Stretching is my new norm, and when that loosen's me up I'll progress to an actual exercise. 
- Seeing the injury as a mental challenge to overcome. I want to beat it. 
- Take each day as it comes. If you're going through hell, keep going. 

The main quote that I keep referring back to is:
''Lock at a stonecutter hammering away at a rock. He hits the rock one hundred times without a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow the rock splits cleanly in two. Realize it wasn't the last blow that did it, it was all the previous attempts that made it possible.''

And that to me is perseverance. On we go."

1,"How to ""get over yourself?"" I just want to know your mindsets in dealing with this? I've been in situations, where I just got to change my attitude and mindset, and the rest will figure itself out. But, I do get annoyed and frustrated in certain occasions throughout the day. And, I know I just have to get over myself, and let those things go. 

&amp;#x200B;

For, example, I'll be on a bus, and get annoyed when someone sits next to me, and tries to talk to me. I just have to take a breath, and be mindful, that they are just being nice. But, it's difficult, especially when I'm trying my best to be more stoic, and not to rush to my emotions in those cases.

&amp;#x200B;

There needs to be ways to dealing with this. I was told I don't show this emotion, or temptation in my face when faced with the problems. It's just it's so easy to want to give in. I've been great at managing my withdrawal of engagement, but I don't think it's sustainable. If anyone has any pointers that would help! ""control what you can control."""

1,"A quote from Ted Roosevelt Jr I’m reading a book about the Allied campaign in Sicily and Italy and I’ve come across a quote from Theodore Roosevelt Jr, the son of TR the president, and I thought it quite poignant. A little context beforehand: at this point in the war, following the successful invasion of Sicily and the taking of the town of Troina, Ted Jr was relieved of his position in the command structure of II Corps, 7th Army, which left him “hurt, despondent and mentally in a black cloud.” With that context, the quote:

“The longer I live the more think of the quality of fortitude- men who fall, pick themselves up and stumble on, fall again, and are trying to get back up when they die.”

I’m not sure if this actually fits with in Stoicism, but I thought maybe those more well versed than I could weigh in. The book is “The Day of Battle” by Rick Atkinson."

However, Ive been noticing while reading Marcus&amp;Seneca( def should be a band name fyi) that they speak heavily against hoarding books and promote reading a small selection of authors over and over and over again.

As a minimalist I agree with their notion, but believe books are essential in learning and developing our brains and should be obtained.

How do I reconcile the two? and do any of you know more quotes that supports either notions.

1,"How Should I Deal With A Toxic Mother? As a stoic, I can very easily remove toxic people and situations from my life. I do not invest any mental or emotional energy into these decisions. I just remove the people who are detrimental to me living out my purpose. But in this instance, where the toxic person is my mother, i'm conflicted as what to do.

Here is a brief background info:  


As a child I was too immature to really pick up on the terrible things my mom did. But as I've become older I've learned a lot about her. 

A few years ago I found out she had been cheating on my father for years and even got pregnant from another man, and then lied to my dad telling him it was his child. My dad never knew and raised my brother as he it were his own. A very honorable thing, and me and my brother are very close, and it doesn't change anything obviously. But I feel she really betrayed my dad by doing this.

She brought my dad into bankruptcy because she is an obsessive shopper.  And then divorced my dad after he invested his life savings into renovating the home, kicking him out and keeping the new upgraded home for herself.

Over my adult life, I've given her money on multiple occasions to save her from foreclosure and demanded she be more responsible with her money or i wouldn't help her again. She took that and labeled me as ""stingy"" and ""greedy"" for not helping her anymore financially.

This year in particular I lived with her for a few months because of COVID and it's when her toxic personality started affecting me personally. I've been slowly noticing that she is a compulsive liar, extremely vengeful and very petty. 

Long story short, last week she stranded me in another country by removing me from her flight benefits and not telling me. (she is retired from a large airline company and she can have one other person listed to use her free flying privileges'). I found out last minute when i tried to book my flight and had to scramble to book something last minute at a very high price.

Normally i just cut off anyone who is toxic. I don't invest any mental or emotional energy into them, and just remove them from my life. But, i can't really do that in this instance.

I don't want to speak to her, but i know that i also may end up regretting that, because we only get so much time with our mothers. 

Do i forgive her, and keep my distance?

I think this is the best course of action. I guess I should let go of my anger towards her and then keep my distance."
1,"Stoicism helps in bad situations. I've been practicing Stoicism since the pandemic started and with all things I've had my ups and downs. Good days and bad, but I was shocked how well I've been able to handle loss now. My uncle died and however we weren't too close it provided the support I needed at the time.

And now it helps again, I learned last night that my best friend's mom pass away yesterday. She was like a second mother to me, and it hits harder when the autopsy report points to a potential murder.

I am not sure if I am in shock or I am just accepting that these things happen.

I keep thinking of Marcus Aurelius and all the losses he had gone through and thinking about how so many people have been through these things. I feel bad for my friends and I am angry with the situation but also oddly calm. 

I just needed to share this, thanks for reading and sorry for the long post."
1,"East of Eden  Been reading East of Eden over the past month.  Almost done. Idk if alot of you are familiar with this book (it's very good, classic).  There is a Chinese man that has a big role in the book. His name is Lee. I'm kinda new to stoicism,  maybe a year of podcasts and reading about it. Somewhat practicing it in my mind when I get stressed out at work or bills etc.. I talk to myself in my head and calm myself down. I know I've seen on this sub reddit questions like ""what movie characters are stoic?"" Some people  said Yoda, optimus prime etc.  Do you think Lee should be on that list of famous characters with a stoic mind?"
1,"Help finding a quote I saw this quote on a philosophy page on Instagram. It went something along the lines of “how long will you put off being your true self?” Or “how long until you act as your true self?”
I can’t find it on the internet. I remember it was by an ancient Roman Philosopher. if anyone knows the quote I am talking about please help a brother out"
1,"Can I be deist and still follow Stoicism? I'm still new to this sub but basically wondering about the question above^. I know these two are different things altogether so there's no use trying to compare them but can I be deist and also follow Stoicism? From what I know about Stoicism, it doesn't state any definitive position on religious aspects and whether or not God is real as the matter is irrelevant. But deism gives me comfort that there is a God even if that God does not intervene."
1,"I overthink in general but it really affects my romantic relationships. The irrational:

 i want to know where i stand in a relationship at all times.  I hate uncertainty (in all cases), it drives me mad.  I doubt myself even when i feel like a relationship is going well.  I fear it will fall apart at any minute and that i am bound to make a mistake.

The rational:

 i feel so fucking dumb when i read the above because it is true.  It's dumb to worry about where i stand in a relationship especially when it's impossible to know what someone is thinking.  It is also dumb to worry about a relationship ending because if it does end, there's nothing i can do about it anyway so i might as well enjoy it while it lasts.

The body: 

i have anxiety.  
I am aware of this anxiety.
I understand my anxiety (the anxiety stems from a pattern of past relationships that ended when i thought things were fine).  


The problem: 

given the above, i am still a slave to my emotions specifically when it comes to romantic relationships.  Is there something i can do or practice when these thoughts/emotions creep into my head?"

I am going back head deep into stoicism starting tomorrow- fear really is the mind kille, I haven't felt fear like this in 5 years and its all for whats always been there but I never cared for.

I use to hear people say they are self medicating with philosophy and thought , ""how so?"" little did I know that ive been doing that ever since I found marcus aurelius book.

1,"Is this a part of Stoic philosophy? A twist on Memento Mori Idea that you ""owe it to yourself"" to live a full life because we will all die is central to stoic thought (memento mori).. I'm wondering if there exists within Stoic philosophy the perspective that you should live life to the fullest not just in the name of *your own* mortality, but to live for those whose lives were cut short by war, disease, or atrocity. 

The idea came to me in reading about various genocides and about the human cost of wars in the last century. These are people who weren't able to take advantage of the gift of life that was bestowed upon them. They had dreams, aspirations, friends/ families as we all do as human beings, and I think that the fact that these things were taken from them prematurely should inspire us to live virtuously and without restraint. 

Let me know what you guys think, and if you think this theme lines up with Stoic philosophy."

Often times while I’m reading a book about Stoicism, for example I am currently reading Seneca, I get frustrated! I find myself trying to understand every single little detail and concept. And if I don’t, I feel stupid and I put the book down. Am I the only one? I try to fully grasp the text and I think as I’m doing so it sort of ruins the purpose which is to just learn and enjoy. I really want to learn more and implement stoic principles and practices into my life, but I feel like I force it. Anyone else struggle it’s this? Or am I alone in this....!

1,"We spend so much time in our heads or absurdity, then life, like a brief flash, has passed you by. Your parents get old. They die. So do your grandparents.

Your friends get married. You lose touch. 

Your get old yourself.

**And what did you really spend your life doing?** 

Look at the people on reddit. There is good, yes, but there's also endless argument, political or otherwise.

**Think about the absurdity of all this \*\*\*\* and how much we attribute meaning and importance to it. Or even random arguments we have on a daily/weekly basis, or the various strong emotions like petty anger or vengeance we seek to inflict on others, or the meaningless little goals we seek to fulfill.**

**We do all this...But we don't live in the moment. We don't see our mother, our father, get old, get frail, and before we know it, they die.** And then you wonder if you should maybe have lived in the moment and spent more time with them.

I know its maybe a common thought but it really hit me how you should savor the moment and how brief life is. I'm a millenial and feel old already. My parents are starting to look frail and death is smiling at them. My friends are looking old. Getting married or having kids.

I feel like I spent my 20s in meaningless arguments, meaningless angst, meaningless suffering. And its gone, I'm now 31. 

**Don't you ever think about the modern capitalist world makes us feel like life is infinite due to the endless distractions and useless goals we are made to seek? The majority of us seem to live meaningless lives and we die at the end, bitter and wondering how the F it went by so fast.**

We're so caught up in our little egotistical quests that we don't realise we're supposed to live. Modern society has taken us so far from our animal nature (animals only live in the present) that we basically are incapable of savoring the moment and things like **memento mori** feel hollow until we see the face of our ageing parents or worse yet, their coffins.

How meaningless most of us are, how easily we waste our lives instead of living the most each day. Most of us wake up too late, on our deathbeds or crying as our parents and loved ones die.

If you are in this situation/mindset now, like I am, please change. Please make the most of tomorrow. Or you will cry of despair when you regret it later. **Focus on what truly matters. The internet and whatever the F is happening in reddit or politics doesn't...**"

We must, I mean, if you are a man you ought to take a stand so that these things will never happen and that our people will always be protected."
1,"US Politics and Stoicism So let me start by saying this will involve a tad bit of my political view in it but most it a run down of Politics and Stoicism.  So let me start by saying I’m neither right nor left wing, conservative or liberal, I am directly down the center of that beautiful bird we call freedom. I don’t support either side in the trying time and nothing at all could get me to change that.  I will however be voting come November, and I wanted to remind my fellow practitioners that is our duty as citizens of this country (USA) and Citizens of the Cosmos, to go out and vote to be the change that we want and that we strive for.  
   For a while in the beginning the stoics felt the need to “perfect” their philosophy so it was mostly a classroom setting. Well in 135-136 BCE Athens had decided to send Philosophers to Rome to try and diplomatically fix their issue and lower a fine that Rome had levied against them. Diogenes of Babylon was sent as the Stoic Diplomat to try and convince them to be merciful through Stoic Rhetoric. It seemed to have worked they lowers the fine against them. This though was almost like a turning point for the school. Many prominent Stoics would later be an integral part of Politics in Ancient Rome, from Cato the younger and his daughter Porcia to Seneca and the “Philosopher king” Marcus Aurelius. The Stoics (most of them any how) would have gladly laid their lives down to ensure that tyranny never ruled. Cato went as far as Suicide as he could not stand to live under the rule of Julius Caesar. 
     If the ancient Stoics can do this, if they can lay down their lives, risk their lives, risk exile, then the least you can do is go out and vote, now only is it your right it’s you obligation as a free person in a country where we are still (for the time being) allowed to vote. 
    I leave you on this though, if you pick for circus leader does not get voted in then you did all you could do and there is no use in complaining about it. And if the one who does get pick threatens us with tyranny remember that the Stoics were not the kind to retreat and hide they were in fact fighters. Thank you all for being on this path with me and may you all have a good rest of your day."

1,"Slow and steady! Lately, I feel I've been constantly put to the test, to show what I've learnt so far, to show how these things are in real life. Although, when I'm in the contest, I often do not readily realise it. I mostly do so when it's over and then I realize that I have either acted well or I haven't.

Just recently, I did a business with a relative with the last cash I had on me. when he disappointed me by telling a story that was poorly rehearsed, and I had nothing left in my account, I reminded myself that I could be happy regardless, that this was nothing strange, that where I placed my value was quite different from where others place theirs, I left a message since he wasn't taking my calls and the message was  not to spite him but to try to convey to him that the right thing is the best thing.. although this has not brought my money back, but then I feel victorious.

Again I went to the market and I was convinced to get something that was not originally budgeted for, turned out the purchase was not worth it in the end, I was duped. To me, this was a contest I lost. I didn't blame myself for being duped, I blamed myself for not staying the course for which I have set in my mind. I allowed external things affect my judgement. I let down my guard.

Today on my way to work, I mistakenly dropped my purse that contained several important stuff. By the time I realized this, I was already at the office so,I checked that I had my ID card and my token to log on for work. I was contented with this. I needed cash but my debit card was in the purse. So I went to the bank,blocked the card and got a new one. Fine my day could proceed. Some of my colleagues who were aware of the matter felt pity for me, but then my mood was light and I told them "" don't worry about me, I'm hopeful that someone will call me but if they don't, that's fine too"" (I had an ID with my phone number on it in the purse). Just before I left the office, someone called me that they found the purse. How quickly did I then recall that in this matter, I was victorious- Not because of the call but because of my attitude with respect to the situation.

I hope not to make any mistakes twice, and I call on life to challenge me more.

I'm not perfect, but then, I believe I'm making progress, not as fast, but then slowly and steadily. This is fine for me 😊

1,"On why we shouldn't try to suppress our emotions but only control our reaction to them. ""I did something I hadn’t done in fifteen years of oncology. I grieved with my team. How? Our team gathered together — doctors, nurses, support staff, and even administrators — and with the guidance of our social workers, we shared what we were feeling about recent patient losses. We listened to each other. We cried together. I allowed my team to see a vulnerable side of myself, the side that had been told since medical school never to show herself, or else. Or else what? Because here’s the thing, nothing bad happened. In fact, good things happened. Both social workers thanked me afterward for my candor and for “being willing to show emotion” in front of the team because, they said, it gave the rest of the team permission to show their emotions, too. Wow, I thought, does that mean before this grief session, my team didn’t think I felt the same things that they did surrounding patient loss?  

Then I realized that from our first days of medical school, doctors are conditioned to hide their emotions away; to suppress and conceal. And because I hadn’t ever spoken to my team about my grief over patient losses before, they assumed I didn’t experience it to the same degree. Suppressing these feelings kind of made me feel less than human, which is definitely not the way I want to be perceived by my team (or my patients).""

From Jennifer Lycette's [article](https://opmed.doximity.com/articles/allowing-grief-is-integration-better-than-compartmentalization?_csrf_attempted=yes) : Allowing Grief: Is Integration Better Than Compartmentalization?  

This, in my opinion, is a great reminder that we shouldn't seek to suppress all negative emotions or hide them necessarily. Instead, our goal should be to express them wisely."

1,"My favorite FAQ point and how I can apply it - rewriting exercise Man am I happy I found this group. As I was reading through the FAQ, one point really resonated with me. It's so simple, so obvious, yet I have failed to make this realization in the self actualization part of my life. Without further ado:

""Regular rewording of such reminders to trigger active engagement and prevent them from becoming ""just words.""

SO SIMPLE, yet I never do this. I don't care what kind of way you're trying to help yourself, from weight loss to learning to whatever, this is a major key to effectiveness. Without this aspect, nothing (or very little) of what you have learned will stick. How many of us have read a self help book, felt motivated, then after a few weeks, forget every single thing about the book. 

I learned a language last year how did I do it ? I studied every day for 45 minites. I didn't learn a word and then say, ""oh cool, I got it, I remember this forever"". Nope. Usually I would see the word and it's translation.  Then, use it to answer a practice question. Then, maybe see it in further reading. Then hear someone say it and make the connection. Then finally after several times of being exposed to that word, I would say it while speaking and bam, then I had the word almost permanently and it was actually ""learned.""

The point being, to learn anything it takes time and repetition.  I never made this connection when it comes to bettering myself or learning new beliefs or ways of being. But with everything else I learn, I have this mentality. 

I'm sure there's others who have done this but didn't make the connection so I hope reading this can help you to put the new knowledge more into a learned self component. 


My action steps now:

1 spend the next few days solidifying some of my favorite lines from, ""meditations"" and also get into writing the main things I want to work on about myself and include WHY. 

2 before my daily language practice and piano practice, I'm going to spend 15 minutes meditating on these. I'll read them, rewrite them, and see if I can develop them more. 

3 rinse and repeat 

I think this will be the start to me eliminating some bad habits that prevent me from reaching my full potential. Not a magic pill, but the foundation for the work I need to do on myself. This will help to make more clear what I want, how to get it, what to avoid, and why I want it. Thanks for reading."
1,"Good Morning my fellow practitioners Good morning everyone,

So I have been up all night listening to ""Lives of the Stoics"" - by Ryan Holiday, and I must say that I cannot recommend it enough.  I am often critical of  Mr. Holiday, I find him to have many contradictions in his videos and podcasts.  That being said I think everyone should pick up a copy of ""Lives of the Stoics"".  He covers the history of the Stoics (or at least the most notable) in really great detail.  It is a reminder that we are humans and though we may strive to be a stoic sage, even Zeno fell victim to wanting to seek revenge.  I must say that I think that Mr. Holiday knocked this one out of the park.  I was unaware of a lot of this, and I'm grateful for his work on this book.  If anyone has read this i would be very happy to discuss it with you in private messages."
1,"What Stoicism asks of newcomers I like to think that Stoicism can work for anybody, regardless of background. However, it doesn't work well for everybody regardless of *effort*. Stoicism is hard work, and depending on your background it can require a whole paradigm shift and literally re-wiring your brain. Coming here, slapping a problem down on our helpdesk^(/s) and saying ""fix this with a quote"" is not the way to go about getting into Stoicism. We have a [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/j2nhhh/faq_link_introduction_beginners_qa_and_general/) for a reason(and it's also a good place to ask ""Where to do I begin?"" questions). 

I want to post the whole of [Enchiridion 29](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0236%3Atext%3Denc%3Achapter%3D29), but the back half really sums it up: ""***Do you think that you can act as you do, and be a philosopher?*** *That you can eat and drink, and be angry and discontented as you are now? You must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintance, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet; come off worse than others in everything, in magistracies, in honors, in courts of judicature. When you have considered all these things round, approach, if you please; if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase equanimity, freedom, and tranquillity.* ***If not, don't come here; don't, like children, be one while a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar's officers.*** *These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own ruling faculty or externals, and apply yourself either to things within or without you; that is, be either a philosopher, or one of the vulgar.""*

If you are really serious about Stoicism, you need to learn to totally let go of externals, at least at the beginning. Epictetus says over and over that you really need to master the dichotomy of control and your internals before you can even consider pursuing externals. Consider Enchiridion 13: ""*If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid with regard to external things. Don't wish to be thought to know anything; and even if you appear to be somebody important to others, distrust yourself. For, it is difficult to both keep your faculty of choice in a state conformable to nature, and at the same time acquire external things. But while you are careful about the one, you must of necessity neglect the other.""* And Enchiridion 2: ""***But, for the present, totally suppress desire: for, if you desire any of the things which are not in your own control, you must necessarily be disappointed; and of those which are, and which it would be laudable to desire, nothing is yet in your possession.*** *Use only the appropriate actions of pursuit and avoidance; and even these lightly, and with gentleness and reservation.""*

I don't mean to come off as an ass, and I'm definitely not advocating for any sort of newcomer question ban. I still think it's better to ask than to not, but...

**tl;dr** If you are actually serious about Stoicism and actually want good, thoughtful answers, then you you should ask good, thoughtful questions. If you want to see results, then you need to be willing to put the work in. Either way, welcome.

Cheers :)"
1,"Virtue and Wisdom have brought nothing I’ve seen several therapists and like 4 psychiatrists, been on a bunch of different medications, and none of it helps. 

My core belief, the one that cannot ever be changed by ECT, therapy, medications, family, or any remaining friendships, is that there is nothing I want more than suicide. No amount of positive thinking or CBT or DBT changes that I want to die. NOTHING WILL EVER CHANGE THAT, AND I DONT WANT IT TO CHANGE. I WANT TO KILL MYSELF AND NOT BE JUDGED OR STOPPED.

I’ve tried suicide several times, but unfortunately get my stomach pumped or am reported before I get to attempt. I’ve been to several psych hospitals, including Yale, and am still just as hopeless and worthless at the beginning. Nothing has changed my mind, only wasted my time. If anyone besides the terminally ill should qualify for euthanasia, it should be the people who don’t want to be alive. The people like me, who can’t and won’t be helped. 

ALL I WANT IS A HUMANE AND EASY WAY OUT. THERE IS NO ESCAPE FROM THIS. 

There is no end to the loneliness and wish to have never been born. Fuck everyone who waste time trying to discourage suicide. People who are determined eventually find a way, and others end up happy to see them go. I hope you all hope I can finally kill myself. I know you all can’t wait to see me leave this Reddit community alone."
1,Significant Strides the past few days. [removed]
1,Is a desire to not scream on rollercoasters considered stoic? I realized I don’t feel like screaming on rollercoasters. They are enjoyable and I feel the adrenaline but I don’t scream for joy. Is this indicative of a stoic nature?
1,"How do I determine what is and isn’t in my control? I’m a bit new to this, and I’ve seen advice that tells me to not to worry about things that I can’t control. 

I’m a bit of a frivolous person, I always like trying new things and throwing myself into them. I’m also of the disposition that people telling themselves they can’t do something is wrong.

I have a habit where I try and solve problems that other people give up on. Like, when someone says that they don’t get a problem because they’re just bad at it makes me want to sit them down and figure it out with them, because the human brain is an amazing work of art and you’re just making assumptions about yourself out of frustration and.... you get the idea.

So, when do I stop worrying about it? If it’s someone else’s opinion, I can try changing it. If it’s something too hard for me I can try and learn to get better at it. If it’s something I hate I can try changing my perspective on it.

No one would disagree with that, so with all that said, when is it not my problem? When is it useless to worry about? Do I just have an ego problem? I’m curious."

1,"What are the thoughts of Stoic Philosophers on Ghost? I know, It may sound strange but bear with me. I know ghosts are externals and thus, the stoic philosophers of the past probably would regard them as not their concern.

So last night, I was dreaming and a ghost appeared in my dream. She was a little girl with white plain dress and long black hair covering her face. Like normal people, I'll get scared if a sudden apparition appeared before me.

But the thing is, in my dream, I did feel the fear appear within me. But I did not react with fear, rather, I shrugged it off and calmly confronted the ghost and walked before it and even tried to touch it. I thought at that moment that it wasn't real, that it was an external and thus could not harm me, for the only thing that could harm me was my own thought. When I woke up, the tingling fear was still there, but I was calm.

This was a very profound experience for me. I've been practicing stoicism for a year now. I failed a lot and I always tried to maintain my virtue and the dichotomy of control. To know that even at my dream, when almost all sense of conscious self is gone, I acted with virtue, was very cool.

So It also made me think. Ghosts has been a part of human experience for as far as we can remember. Did any of the stoics wrote anything about them?"

At the end of each day, I write how well did I do based on my values ( Honesty, Kindness, Self Control etc) and what did I do right and wrong concerning each area.

1,"Objective perception  Perception is what makes you you. Perception is what is going to decide on your actions when confronted to circumstances. The way you intercept the world and your surroundings was formed since the day you were born. You were born into a place with people that also got their own perception which also formed itself over the course of their lives. The found circumstances of your early life are going to depict themselves onto your new found perception, what you experience is what you're going to feel and act like, you adapt. Since this world couldn't be any more different from life to life from individual to individual, every man's perception and perspective on this world is going to be different from one another, of course, we are going to search and find some people who got the same opinions and worldviews than we do, but our core perception, is going to be unique. 

This said it would be easy to say that people are victims of circumstances since they couldn't decide on the place they were going to grow up in, which is true to some extent, but on the other hand an Individual not only has an unique perception, but has an unique mind too which affects their perception to a noticeable degree. The perception of an individual is being shaped by the mind of one, the mind is what is there in the first place, early experiences and opinions are being processed by one's unique mind which translate to a subjective perception of it's surroundings. Likewise the perception, the mind is getting shaped by surroundings, but contrary to the perspective, the mind is able to perceive objectively, thus, able not to fall victim to it's circumstances. That said it is still very unlikely for an individual aged from 0 to 10 to be able to integrate an objective point of view into his life without the knowledge of it's existence.

As the years pass we experience, we learn, we adapt, each year we live through having a substantial impact on our general mindset and perception. We could say that, if an individual spends twenty years exposed to constant subjectivity, you can with a pretty high certainty expect that said individual isn't living up to it's full potential. The reason for it being that full potential can only be reached through full objective concentration of your gathered knowledge and skills on the continuity of growth of your knowledge and skills, which is close to impossible when subjectivity envelops your perception and overall mindset. The reason for it being like that is that subjectivity doesn't allow you to see things as they really are, you're able too see small portions, but the bigger picture, even when being right in front of your eyes, remains hidden.

Subjectivity consistently influences the way you think, it influences your your interior and exterior decision making constantly by giving your brain input of past experiences that conclude a possible outcome of a situation. Meaning that, a situation, with someone who you've never met, somewhere you've never been, already has a subjective outcome. Despite it being completely new and unfamiliar to you, your perception already intercepted something that it would judge either good or bad and will accordingly notify your brain about it's discovery. Your brain is going to pass the message to your subconsciousness which is going to reflect itself onto your actions, thus, limiting the accessibility of tenant-able neutral objective emotional ground. The neutral ground is supposed to be the foundation on which you are building up new experiences, that in the future, will influence your perception, but in a far less subjective, way more ''unprejudiced'' manner. This unprejudiced manner of perceiving your surroundings allows your character to grow. Instead of living with past persuasions, we live to seek assent to our prejudices and subjective beliefs. Only this way are we able to perceive the world from angles that were yet hidden from us by strong past subjective perceptual restrictions.

Through neutrality and objectivity the bigger picture reveals itself.

1,"How do you really change your life? I am in a quite unstable relationship that’s affecting me whenever we have a fight. He is bipolar, so I think that’s the reason why I get a different version of him. Some days we’re good. Some days he acts unreasonable like getting pissed off easily, talking immaturely instead of constructively. 

I feel like I am in a toxic relationship, but at the same time we’ve both been trying to be better for each other. 

I notice that to be happy in my relationship, I ask him to act this way instead of this, so we can have better communication.

But I feel like I’m changing who he is? Or I’m not just trying to accept the reality that he has bipolar so he acts this way? And I have to accept that part of him.

I love this person a lot. But I don’t want my happiness anymore to rely on him. I get disturbed mentally that I can’t focus on my job if we have a fight.

Our fight usually leads to break up then make up then rinse and repeat.

Is it really possible to change the dynamics of my relationship if I focus on changing myself? 

What steps should I take as a stoic?"

1,"I don't even know what love is I'm 20(M). I have been finding it very difficult to recognise what is love. I was in my first proper relationship last year. I liked her and I thought I loved her. But when dyas passed I realised I didn't really loved her, I liked the companionship and attention. I didn't really feel something on her. Its weird and I thought maybe I haven't found the right one. I have been exploring and going to many places meeting new friends and I realised I haven't really found the love feeling. Tbh, I don't even know how to define love. I tried googling and it did not help me. My first relationship was a failure since I couldn't really differentiate what is love, affection, companionship, lust and infatuation. I'm scared that I wouldn't find the loved one. I'm scared if even I find the right one, It would fade away. My ex-girlfriend is going through depression because of me. I am super guilty about it.

I need help. I am scared that I won't find love. I'm a person who loves helping others and have a lot of friends. A little popular among girls. I don't know man, I smoked pot and tried to introspect what really love is and I realised I'm having trust issues and because of that, its been difficult to even take the next step with people."

1,"Negative visualization - thought from a funeral Went to a funeral, a relative who died young.  
It was a big gathering, people grieving and remembering him.  
At that moment, looking at the crowd it hit me - negative visualization.  
What would everybody give just to see him walk out his home and greet us, even for half an hour?  
Everybody would smile, have happy tears in their eyes and be joyful.  


This is a perfect example of negative visualization and what powerful effect it could have when doing it regularly *(and not waiting for something sad to happen, because then it's too late)*."
1,"I Completed 60 Days of Meditation for 1 Hour/day and it cut my Anxiety away. I Then Made an App.  I recently completed Naval Ravikant's recommended 60 days of meditation for 1 hour per day. I tried meditating before this for around 20/30 mins but never really felt that much benefit. So I started doing 1 hr. I tweeted about each day which kept me accountable and committed each day.

At first it was very difficult to sit still for that long. But after the first week, I started to truly realise that all of my problems were in my own head. I was perceiving things poorly, from past images that I'd clung onto.

Reading wisdom from the main 3 stoic philosophers, Jiddu Krishnamurti and Naval Ravikant each day also helped to rewire my mind, giving me useful stuff to meditate on. I now realise that living in the past causes depression and living in the future causes anxiety. Discovering for myself that this is true makes me almost unconsciously stay present - and I feel much better for it.

I am currently learning to code and as a practice project I made a meditation app that I am now using myself. It's based on doing 60 days of meditation, 1hr / day. At the beginning, only day 1 is unlocked. After meditating for at least 15 mins, the next day is unlocked. Each day has some advice/quotes from the philosophers I mentioned before.

Complete a 30 min session to be awarded 1 star, 45 mins for 2 stars and 60 or more for 3 stars. There are bonus unlockable Tao meditations for total stars and day streaks.

This video demonstrates the app: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QYDCRtym2g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QYDCRtym2g)

1,Epicurus recommendations Which texts of Epicurus would you recommend? Are there modern translations that do a sufficient job?
1,"How can I deal with the fact that my mothers partner is demanding and unfair? My mums partner often accuses me (18 years) and my siblings (16 and 13 years) of being lazy. He talks about how my mum struggles to do things, typically since she has a baby. Yet, do all the chores assigned to us. Never have we refused. I walk my dog, I do the dishes, I clean up my after my mums boyfriend’s dog goes to the toilet as he wants me too, I clean my room regularly, I clean the pool regularly, my brother does some outside chores, I always clean up after myself and wash my own dishes, not always but sometimes I’ll sweep the floor. Most of the mess in the house is from my brother who’s a toddler. Yet, my mums boyfriend, ever since we’ve known him, accuses my siblings and I as lazy. My mum doesn’t ask us to do more around the house. If in fact she does, she doesn’t tell us. Perhaps she’s told my mums boyfriend this or perhaps he just isn’t satisfied with that which we do. I shouldn’t have to clean up after his dog, but I do and feel like a slave. 

Maybe I could sweep the floor more, or clean the bathroom, or wash my own clothes, yet I don’t get told. I would if I did get told. I’ve tried to offer in the past but my mum told me to not worry about it. My mums boyfriend does not consider how much we do, and when my grandparents come to visit they feel sorry for us. But if anybody tells him their opinion, or if my siblings or I speak of the things we do, he’ll bark back at us and may enforce more labels onto us or find more things to speak of so he gets the last word, whether there relevant things or not. He may pick on me and speak of little mistakes or things he doesn’t like such as the fact that I mate rar sound counselling headphones when I exit the room (however very rarely I do), because I have autism and struggle with noise.  

I’m happy if we are asked to help out more, yet I’m not happy that he accuses my siblings and myself as being lazy and unhelpful. And f someone shades opinions he utterly despise it. He tried to parent us as well a if he’s our dad. He’ll demand my brother to brush his teeth if he doesn’t, my mum doesn’t. He’ll be mad if we have a sleep in on our day off, my mum doesn’t think of it as a bad thing yet she wouldn’t express her opinions either because she may face the same consequences as us. I don’t stand to die my siblings much because I know I’ll be in trouble and my anxiety will go up. I may defend myself politely, where necessary, however he just gets more angry and find other ways to pick at me, relevant or not. 

My mums partner will often have bite at us when he is frustrated or feels like he can. It’s rare he tells us politely to help out he’d only stress that we are lazy. This happens nearly every week. If we have a meeting which is rare he promises us that he’ll make us do more. 

How should I respond to this?"
1,Does Stoicism help self-esteem and self respect? How? [removed]
1,"""The only war you should fight it's internal not external."" it's more a Meditativethought."
1,"Uncertainty, doubt, and lack of conviction in Stoic practices? I've made considerable progress over the past months. I know the main ideas of Stoicism and understand them quite intimately (Virtue is the only good, vice is the only evil, externals are indifferent...) and I've been keeping a Stoic journal to record my thoughts and to review what impressions I may have and discern whether it's rational or not.

However my main problem with the practice is uncertainty, doubt, and lack of conviction.

There are some days where I would be so sure of what I'm doing, where I would set my mind on virtue, reject vice, and be able to deal with impressions well and premeditate on any adversity which can come. But a lot of days is spent in uncertainty. I would wonder, ""Do I truly understand Stoicism?"" I would doubt myself on any decision I made even if I tried to make them with virtuous intent, I would be uncertain about a lot of core principles that I've instilled long ago (Why be virtuous? Why help others? Why practice this-and-that?).

How do you all keep yourselves certain in your Stoic practice? How do you not waver, not have doubts, not have uncertainties which may cause you to stray?"

1,"Some parts of Stoicism I don't understand... Hello there! I'm an 18 year old person who's been reading stoicism on and off for about a year and a half now. I'll try not to write too much, instead I'll keep this as short as possible for you all.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the things I don't understand are some parts of ""If it's out of your control, don't worry about it"" As one of the things out of our control is what other people think..but does that mean we should not try and convince them what is right/wrong? Additionally, with that mindset how would we have people who break the barriers, for example....(this may be a bad example) but if someone wanted a better light source and hated/was not satisfied with their current situation, then they may have developed/invented several things such as nikola tesla...that might be a bad example so I'll write another one. Steve Jobs was very nit-picky and if some things weren't perfect in the iPhone he would have someone fix it until it was perfect. If he did not like something in our world, instead of thinking ""Well that is out of my control"" he would instead try to figure out how to further improve or invent something that would benefit him.  


For some reason my interpretation of the stoic mindset is that you should be cool headed, think logically...but also not be super motivated...kind of just go with the flow. I'm not sure if I don't understand something here and there is a lot more I don't get but if you understand what I mean please do explain it to me."

""You should, I need hardly say, live in such a way that there is nothing which you could not as easily tell your enemy as keep to yourself"" p. 35 (Penguin Classics version).

This comes in the middle of Seneca's discussion on friendship. Is he saying that you should live in such a way that you could tell your enemy anything about yourself without fear? Or is he saying the opposite: live in such a way that it'd be easier to keep things to yourself than tell your enemy something. Or something else?

Thanks for the help."

1,"Dichotomy of Cognition **Cognition** is commonly defined as the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses. If we can't think of it, if we can't experience it, if we can't sense it then it isn't knowable. It will be mere imagination or fantasy, fiction even. But we usually carry this fiction to heart because we find it fanciful against the reality of pure Natural experience. The things outiside our cognition cannot disturb us, because we cannot even sense them.

**Some things are within our cognition, while others are not.** 

We tend to think we know much more than we can truly understand. This common mistake leads to distortions and false judgements, which take the mind into unnecessary disturbances. 

Do you think you know the future with certainty? Do you think you know the past with certainty? Do you think you know yourself with certainty? At least, certainly, we are used to acting as if we do.

**You don't know what happens when people die.**

You've recited Memento Mori to heart, but what it means is rather subjective. Some think they will depart to paradise. Some think they will simply sleep forever. Some say they come back in another body. If there is certainty about death it is not just that it will come, it's that it's mysterious. Perhaps too mysterious for most. Can you accept this ignorance? 

**You don't know the ideal society.**

How many times have we been through this? How many times have wise men proposed dramatic reforms, radical teardowns of customs, and endeavoured into bringing perfection to life? Who can even know these things? And even if it works well for a while, human entropy is such that ignorance grows no matter what, and great laws are forgotten.

**You don't know power.**

If I just had more power I would be happy - says the naive one. How can you know what having power will do to you if you've never had it? What is it about controlling others that excites you? Have you ever even controlled your own mind? That would be real power, power you could actually know something about if you tried.

**You don't know science.**

Not even science knows science. The best theories are not truths. Not even approximations of truth. They are simulations of truth. Has anyone seen differential equations crossing by the Moon above telling it where to go? One day even Einstein will be dethroned by a new simulation. Of course, follow the best scientific advice if you will. Next month they will have a new one. Next year they will have a different one. Is this fruitless? Not so. It's merely the acceptance of our ignorance. We know as much as we can try, but we have to try. Just don't become a fool by thinking you know it all - or even know it *at all*.

# All we can know is this present moment.

Right now you're alive. At the moment you have time to reflect. In this instant you're not suffering. All we can tell is what is happening, not what has happened nor what will. History reads like a fairy tale. Predictions read like the sayings of madmen. Can we learn from fairy tales? Sure, great morals and lessons, but it's always obvious it comes from the bias of the author. Can we prepare ourselves against the predicted doom that's coming? If you can. They've been wrong so many times before it's almost funny. One day they will be right, but by the mere accident that if you predict something every day, one day it will happen."

1,Know Yourself - Wallpaper 
1,"YOU DON’T HAVE TO STAY ON TOP OF EVERYTHING “If you wish to improve, be content to appear clueless or stupid in extraneous matters—don’t wish to seem knowledgeable. And if some regard you as important, distrust yourself.”

—EPICTETUS, ENCHIRIDION, 13a

Most of society seems to have taken it as a commandment that one must know about every single current event, watch every episode of every critically acclaimed television series, follow the news religiously, and present themselves to others as an informed and worldly individual.

But where is the evidence that this is actually necessary? Is the obligation enforced by the police? Or is it that you’re just afraid of seeming silly at a dinner party? 

How much more time, energy, and pure brainpower would you have available if you drastically cut your media consumption? How much more rested and present would you feel if you were no longer excited and outraged by every scandal, breaking story, and potential crisis (many of which never come to pass anyway)?"

1,"I think I figured out Stoic depression. I think an analogy would be best to describe what I think. So reader, have you ever had appendicitis? Appendicitis is an infection of the appendix; my family member's appendicitis was bad. It first was a mild pain until the infection spread, it became agonizing. Eventually their appendix burst. Now, a burst appendix could very easily be a death sentence, if the infection spread to other parts of the body there would be no chance of fighting it off. Fortunately, in this case their body created a wall around the burst appendix, which contained the infection and allowed the infection to be fought off. After surgery to remove the appendix they made a speedy recovery.

I think depression is like this infection, except it doesn't spread the same way. Depression spreads through vice. It's like a lie, you tell one lie it leads to two more and eventually you're overwhelmed with lies. With depression, you give in to one vice, for me it was calling off from work because I couldn't get out of bed. Then I did it a few times, next eventually quitting my job and inevitably then living in a car. It's at this point depression has spread to every aspect of my life and fighting it off was even more difficult then it would be at the start (I'm well now if it is important to you). If you let the infection spread through your whole body it will be near impossible to fight it off. You have to wall it off so your body can fight it off. Of course if depression spreads through vice then to wall it off you need virtue. If you retain your virtue, and wall off the infection then your body WILL fight it off with time.

When it comes to toxic people, drug abuse, neglecting daily care, over indulgence, reclusive behavior, etc.. if you allow these vices into your life they will spread through out. It takes immense strength to avoid these, and with any battle you gain ground and you lose ground. But you can win."
1,"I'm not afraid of dying but I'm afraid of the pain that it might bring to my loved ones With the whole pandemic going around I've started thinking about what would happen if I had it and also if I couldn't survive it. If I had it I wouldn't be afraid to die from it but since death isn't something everyone really sees that often it's hard to tell how you or someone else would respond to it. If a loved one died I know I would feel sad but I know I can get through it one way or another. But I am still young and it's hard to imagine me dying, whether it's from the virus or from something else entirely, and find a way in which people like my parents wouldn't take it so well. And it's also not just from the virus but I start to think about any other way I could die. It doesn't scare me to think about dying, I think about it all the time, and stoicism teaches you that death isn't something you can control, and it's part of nature, therefore you should welcome it whenever it decides to come. And I agree but my biggest fear is that if I die before anyone else in my family, they will take it very badly and who knows what the death of a son or brother might do to a person. Some people handle it well but others are maybe too attached to the deceased that it may jeopardize their happiness, their choices, and maybe even their will to live. I'm not saying that I'm the only reason my family is alive, but I'm saying that I recognize the feelings they have for me and I worry about them and whether or not they'll manage in the case that I do die. Cause nobody knows what's gonna happen and I think it's important to prepare for anything. I don't really know what question I should ask about this, but anything that might help me and ease my state of mind would be greatly appreciated."

1,"At what point is it ""appropriate"" to offer a little bit of advice, or share a quick aphorism? I understand the appeal and the value of being a ""closet stoic"" as I've heard it called before; live the life and values, don't preach it.

But sometimes I feel like I can help someone else by offering them a bit of Stoic wisdom (of course not *my* wisdom, but wisdom I've come across that helped me) because it helps me so it might help them, and that's a Stoic virtue in and of itself; kindness and helping others.

But you can't go around preaching this and that acting like you can see where everyone else went wrong while I'm a Stoic sage...


So where's the line drawn??

For example,

Let's say you're getting into architecture and need to learn how to design. You need to build a PC and you can afford to build a suited up PC that will cost you $2000. But at the same time, you could easily get away with doing everything on a $1000 PC.

The $2000 PC comes with lots of perks: like videogaming, and other fun CPU-hogging stuff like video editing and more intensive architecture designs. Although, you can be frugal and do none of that.

Or, lets say you you need a car for traveling.

You can afford a $5000 used car with heated seats, automatic windows, and other cool perks. But you can also be frugal and spend $2500 without those perks, but the traveling would be less enjoyable, which may make the experience going to work different.

1,"How does a stoic act in self defense? Stoicism practices keeping emotions in check and not acting on anything without thinking of repercussions and our actions first. So what about a self defense situation? If a man threatens our life whether at knife or gun point or even a brawl, do we accept that we are here at this point in life? Taking the beating, wound, or even death? Do we speak to the man and try to help him see the error of his ways, even though his understanding is out of our control? Or do we fight? Protecting ourselves, and at what point do we know is too much? If they were to take my life, should I do the same? Or aim to the most peaceful approach possible? Do any of the ancient stoics we learn from ever speak on the subject? How did they view self defense?"
1,"Speaking like a stoic / How to console others? As I've been working on adopting a more stoic mindset, I had the idea that it might also be a good idea to have my speech reflect the stoic mindset I'm trying to develop. 

For example, not using the words ""good"" and ""bad"" to describe (dis)preferred indifferents. I like to think that changing my speech patterns will serve as a reminder to see impressions for what they are and reinforce a stoic mindset. 

Now the question.. language is obviously meant to communicate with others, and those others might not have a stoic mindset. If a friend comes to me (for support) and says they broke up with their partner, how can I comment on that event in a way that is both stoic and empathic to their situation? 

Curious to hear your thoughts. Let me know if you think I'm over thinking it, or if you think one should be precocious with their words."

1,"Crybaby no more. Is there some sort of practice I can do to help me not cry for any little thing. I annoy myself with how emotional I can be and I’m sure it’s overwhelming to others as well. 

Example: I was explaining to my boss and didn’t feel well and got choked up. Why?? Not a good reason to cry. 

I honestly believe it was something I learned as a child. Cry to get your way or pity. I was extremely spoiled and babies as a child due to family circumstances. How do I make it stop??

Also, I feel extreme jealousy from time to time. Any thoughts on that?"

1,"What should I do? I am in a long distance friendship with a close friend who’s I’ve known for 3 years. 

Sometimes when I say something and it may look as though as she is unhappy about that which I said. I will ask, “Did I say something wrong? Are you annoyed?” She may choose not to answer that and just say nothing. She might tell me, if I ask again, that she simply doesn’t want to answer that, which I cannot understand why. So I just accept it and move on, not knowing whether I was in the wrong or not, giving that she could not provided me with an answer. Perhaps she was annoyed with me or she is just unhappy about something else, I wonder to myself. It’s questions like these she sometimes isn’t willing to answer, she may just change the subject or say simply nothing. 

Sometimes she will cut me off when I’m talking and she will just say her part, if not she changes the subject completely. I have found it is not a specific thing I speak about which causes her to do such. It could be any topic whatsoever. If it wasn’t that important I would just let it go. Else, i will politely tell her “I never got to finish what I was saying when you cut me off.” Afterwards, she may be sorry and let me continue. However, in some occasions I won’t get the chance to continue rather she continues what she is saying. 

When I express myself, oftentimes she will not be content with it. I always be fair and virtuous. I don’t blame or point the finger but I will say hoe I’ve been feeling about something. 

Yesterday, on a FaceTime call, she cut me off about 3 times when I was trying to express myself. She was wondering why I seemed upset, yet I couldn’t ever finish my sentence so I gave up. I find it hard to get a word in too, for she may speak extravagantly. I was upset. I didn’t want to speak of it. A) because I knew I probably wouldn’t get anywhere. And B) sometimes when I express myself it turns out bad. And so I did so afterwards on, I told her briefly what happened and how I felt. She said “just say it now on test then.” But I said to her I rather speak about it on call that way it’s easier, it will take a while to write ur and it’s super late and I’m struggling to keep my eyes open. I can’t remember what she responded with exactly, but she was not happy about that clearly although she wouldn’t admit it. She evidently didn’t want to hear it. I tried to tell her, “this is why I hesitate to express myself, because oftentimes you are not happy about it or willing to hear it.” She then concluded that she has had enough and she’s leaving and that was the end. 

Yet, if I don’t express myself I end up feeling horrible. I rather let it out and be honest. Only it doesn’t often end well and I can’t understand why. I don’t know wha I should do. We don’t have much drama except about this particular circumstance."
1,Stoic Quotes that will TURN AROUND YOUR LIFE 
1,"The five deadly sins of Stoicism (Meditations 2.16, Long translation) The soul of man does violence to itself when:

* It becomes an abscess and, as it were, a tumor on the universe, so far as it can. For to be vexed at anything which happens is a separation of ourselves from nature, in some part of which the natures of all other things are contained.
* It turns away from any man, or even moves towards him with the intention of injuring, such as are the souls of those who are angry.
* It is overpowered by pleasure or by pain. 
* It plays a part, and does or says anything insincerely and untruly. 
* It allows any act of its own and any movement to be without an aim, and does anything thoughtlessly and without considering what it is, it being right that even the smallest things be done with reference to an end; and the end of rational animals is to follow the reason and the law of the most ancient city and polity. 

The title is a bit tongue-in-cheek. Obviously Stoics don't necessarily believe in ""sin"" as outlined christian faiths. We do have virtue though, which is similar. I was going to offer a short breakdown blurb but honestly Marcus speaks for himself here. What one do you struggle with the most?"

Conversely, being pained by another’s pain is also wrong. This is the passion called compassion, and it requires making the opposite mistake, shrinking away from something indifferent that merely appears as an evil. No matter how vicious a person is, it is always wrong to rejoice in their misfortune."

1,"Do you have principles? Let's make a list! ""*I'd like to be a person of principles. I just don't know what those principles could be,*"" I said to my friend who laughed and wrote my words down. I've been thinking this ever since.

If one has values or wants to tend their virtues, one must have principles. If one has honesty as their value, unless it is put to practice, it means nothing. I use **principles as instruments**, with which I can practice my values and virtues. With principles, I can put my values to work.

I'd like for you to share what principles you have, what rules in life you try to follow, what habits are important for you, because I and other readers might like to try them also. Here's some of my mine. (The format is `value -&gt; principle`.)

### Love -&gt; Be kinder to others than you were yesterday

Kindness has no cost and it can only add to the well being of everybody. I can't deny that I could be a little more kinder to the people I meet every day. I find it most interesting to practice this with people I don't know: with the clerk at the supermarket, with a waiter in a restaurant, with a random person I have eye contact in the street.

### Authenticity -&gt; Do not discuss about things you already know

This comes mainly from [Enchiridion](https://enchiridion.tasuki.org/display:Code:gl/section:33]) which has multiple points on the matter. I try not to speak about things that have happened to be. I strive to be present on what I feel *right now*, what my views are *at this very moment* and *why* are these things true to me. This principle also leads me to interrupt people if they themselves are ruminating or I'm having difficulties connecting with them for some other reason.

### Honesty -&gt; Never lie

In no circumstance do I lie. Also, if I feel that somebody has a false impression on something, usually considering me (most importantly on what I did, or what I intend to do but also what I think) I'm obliged to set it straight. This principle leads to radically awkward situations and I love it. (I can, of course, always answer to a question with ""*I don't feel like telling you right now*"", which is true and in line with the principle.)

### Good judgement -&gt; Write every day

Journaling has shown itself to be transformative practice. For me, it works to do it in the morning, and I can always return to it later in the day if I need. Additionally, I have a rule that ""*one sentence is enough*"". It also helps me to keep in mind that skipping or failing once is natural, but twice is the beginning of a new habit.

### Good judgement -&gt; Don't read in the toilet

I'm interested what happens, when I need to I interrupt what I'm doing, and then just spend a little time being mostly bored. I find this sometimes helps me to calibrate my next actions more purposefully."
1,"Have you made mistakes in life?.. well, that's fine. &gt;Consider this then that to borrow money is not sufficient to make a man a debtor but add to this that he continues to owe the money and refuses to pay, he then becomes a debtor.  so it is not enough to compel you to admit the inference that you have granted the premisses, but you must abide by what you have granted. Indeed, if the premisses continue to the end such as they were when they were granted, it is absolutely necessary for us to abide by what we have granted, and we must accept their consequences: but if the premisses do not remain such as they were when they were granted, it is absolutely necessary for us also to withdraw from what we granted, and from accepting what does not follow from the words in which our concessions were made. For the inference is now not our inference, nor does it result with our assent, since we have withdrawn from the premisses which we granted.
-Epictetus Discourses book I chapter 7

Sometimes, we get an overwhelming feeling of guilt because of certain things we have done or certain mishaps that arose due to our decisions in the past most of which we blindly granted without knowing what would follow after. Epictetus is saying that nothing done out of error is our fault or blamable on ourselves. The only time these things become our fault is if we continue in the path of error after it has been discovered. So, we must immediately withdraw from false beliefs, false opinions and false actions when we discover them, no one is above mistakes and every mistake is an opportunity to learn not a reason to feel down.

The apostle Paul mentioned something similar  when he said

&gt; If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature, old things have passed away, behold all things are as new. 
2 Corinthians 5:17"
1,"An odd realization Fairly new to stoicism, learning and practicing over a year Along with finding a great podcast that explains philosophies very well, but I had such an odd thing come to mind about stoicism in practice. While enjoying a beautiful Thursday afternoon on the porch with my pup,  I see a spider web that was ugly and disgusting next to a plant and a wood post. Normally I would be bothered by this. Not in a huge way to ruin my day, but in a nuisance way  that ruins my expectations of what my porch should be on a beautiful day.

 Instead I looked at the spider and it's web and thought how silly it would be to expect a creature that cannot rationalize like us to understand what it's does and how it affects me. I genuinely felt no slight disgust or annoyance from it. Stoicism has helped me fundamentally change my the way I react initially and I am happy with that."
1,"NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING WRONG “If anyone can prove and show to me that I think and act in error, I will gladly change it—for I seek the truth, by which no one has ever been harmed. The one who is harmed is the one who abides in deceit and ignorance.” 

- MARCUS AURELIUS, MEDITATIONS, 6.21

Someone once attempted to argue with the philosopher Cicero by quoting something he had said or written. This person claimed Cicero was saying one thing now but had believed something different in the past. His response: “I live from one day to the next! If something strikes me as probable, I say it; and that is how, unlike everyone else, I remain a free agent.”

No one should be ashamed at changing his mind—that’s what the mind is for. “A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds."""
1,"How to journal with stoicism Hello dear community,

I've started with stoicism about 6 months ago reading Seneca and Marcus Aurelius, 2 months ago I started Journaling my Stoic and overall experience of the day the morning after, I'm also reading a page of the daily Stoic while journaling

I practice to view my days as separate lifes and think about them every evening and what I'll take into the ""next life"" tomorrow, this was a great addition to my life because it made me review and reevaluate a lot of day to day routines

Now during working days I start my day around 3:30am working from home until the wife and my son wakes up at around 6:00 am, after preparing breakfast I sit down and write my journal for the past day

I tried journaling on the evenings but I couldn't stick to it so the morning fits me better, however maybe because of a few hours sleep and being occupied already with 2 hours work I just feel like journaling doesn't give me much value. There are days where I don't know what I should write down from yesterday and can't really see the practical meaning in the daily Stoic, it tends to become something I have to do rather then want to do because I don't really see a meaning in it. However I know that journaling helps me a lot on different things already, because I do it for different subjects on a weekly or  daily basis. But with a journal for practicing stoicism.. I guess I just haven't found my way


Anyone here has a good journaling habit or any other good experience with journaling for this Stoic endeavor? I would love to hear about that, what questions do you ask yourself, do you implement daily exercise? I really would like to hear your ideas

While writing this post I thought about making a weekly instead of a daily journal and just do one exercise a week everyday and write one paragraph per day how I did and how I felt with it.. Maybe this is something worth trying as well

Anyway, I'm looking forward to your response"

1,"How does a stoic approach the feeling of incompetence? I was the textbook ""talented and gifted"" student in highschool. Star football player, good grades, respected by peers and basically good at everything I touched. My last year of high school I went through a bad depression and dropped out of football, grades went down, and eventually dropped out of college. That was 5 years ago. I've since had a sub-par job and a child. 

Now it seems like my brain is too slow to be good at anything I try to do. I don't feel competent at my career or my hobbies. I also think I could be a better relationship partner and a better father. I believe that because of the success I had early in life, being ""mediocre"" is unacceptable to my ego. I'm struggling.

1,"I am Stoic because it gives me security. Before discovering Stoicism I had terrible anxiety about the future, what people thought of me, failing at school or not living up to my standards for myself. I handicapped myself because I was so scared of failing I resorted to writing giant sheets of notes for open note tests instead of really studying. I stopped myself from talking to my coworkers because I was afraid they didn’t like me. Everyone was either someone who potentially didn’t like me, someone to be envious of, or both. Fully embracing my fate and thinking of my principles before acting has vastly improved these problems in my life, I truly don’t know where I would be without these ideals."
1,"I don’t travel when I take PTO at work and here’s why: At a very basic level, Seneca and other stoic s teach us that only what we can control on the inside can bring us happiness, not the external world. How can we be happy when our happiness relies on things we can control? When you take away those things you are left as unhappy you started. 

That’s why I don’t take frantic vacations to the Bahamas, or Cancun, or Europe, or anywhere that Instagram demands we go in order to be happy. Because at the end of the day if you’re spending the year getting your hopes up and being miserable just so you can spend two weeks out of 52 to see the Eiffel Tower, you’ll be unhappy and miserable when you go back to your office, and then you’ll be planning your next big vacation to forget about things

I’ve seen this play out for all my friends. They post their exotic vacations on Instagram and show the world how happy they were for one week out of a whole year, and it got me thinking.

Do I really want to be that guy that needs to go to exotic vacations in order to be happy? Do I really want my happiness contingent on which monument I got to see or touch this year? Or do I want inner happiness, every day of the year? 

I find peace of mind reading books about these places, the history, the science. I don’t need to spend thousands every year to be happy. 

Practicing mindfulness has really helped me be content and happy without relying on the external world."
1,"Struggling with my emotions and leaving a bad relationship I am trying my best to practice care and concern only for the things that matter in life and not let strong emotions cloud my (better) judgement. 

I've just left a toxic relationship that has caused me stress and pain, I feel better and more logical now. I know that this decision is right, but yet I struggle. I struggle with the ""hope"" that turning back and having this chance at a better time (we were dealing with personal issues before that are over) would allow things to work out. 

I chanced upon this quote on a medium article I read "" Hope is dangerous. Yes, things can get better, but they can also get worse. Hope creates expectations of improvement: expectations that will knock you down when you don’t meet them. Instead of telling people their lives could get better, Stoics told people their life could get worse. "" 

Deep down I know the path but yet this path is not without struggle. I want to be someone that does not pursue things that do not matter and things I know are wrong for me.

Take it away,

And everything will be okay…

***-His life will continue without her, he still lives***

You cut a perfect form and,

Someone forever warm,

Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on,

Lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on…

***-This girl was great, but he’s got to carry on with his life***

Way upon the mountain where she died,

***-He put her up on a pedestal and she couldn’t live up to those expectations***

All I ever wanted was your life,

***-This line is sarcastic; her life is not something he should want nor something she can give, that is too much to ask, this was his mistake***

Deep inside the canyon I can't hide,

***- he is not able to hide from the pain of loss, so he faces it instead; the obstacle is the way***

Show love with no remorse and,

***- don’t let this loss affect how you deal with others, keep living virtuously***

Climb on to your seahorse and,

This ride is right on course,

***- fate is playing out as it should (not sure about the seahorse lol)***

This is the way,

I wanted it to be with you,

This is the way,

I knew that it would be with you,

***- he has accepted the loss, maybe prepared for it; more of the obstacle is the way***"

1,"My relationship is suffering. Don’t wanna dive into too much detail, but simply put my relationship with my partner is seeming to fall apart all around me. Or so it feels that way. Him being in the military and being away, only seeing him 8 days total since January of this year, and our long distance over the phone relationship is just starting to get worse everyday. It gives me anxiety and fear about the future. I’m afraid of losing this person, and then dealing with the aftermath or a heartbreak. I’m also afraid that no matter how hard I try, our relationship won’t get any better and I’ll be fighting for something that in the end isn’t worth it. 

Stoicism has been something I turn to when I need some comfort and reassurance that everything is gonna be okay...but I’m no professional.

My name is Ben and I am a junior in high school. Like all of us, stoicism has had a profound impact on my life. It has changed the way I look at school, relationships, and myself.

1,"Modern Desires Natural Desires There are the desires for the things that come naturally, like food or water. We already know from birth what we need. How to have fun, how to enjoy ourselves, where to seek love, how to live peacefully. When the philosopher says we should live according to Nature this is what they mean. However in this modern world of perpetual artifice and spectacle, our minds are repeatedly being hijacked. We are being told what to believe, what to buy, what to cheer for, what to watch, what to think - constantly. From the mass media to the social reinforcement from the normal people who repeat their messaging, it is hard to find Nature again. Now Artifice is our deity. An Adonis made in polycarbonate.

Think of this dichotomy as an exercise: The desire for the artificial is to be rejected. The desire for what's natural is to be welcomed.

Do you want to stay in touch with friends? That's natural. Do you need to buy a 1400$ phone to do it? No. Can you get away with the same connection for 200$? Sure you can. We're not primitivists here, but surely the desire for the Brand and the Latest and Greatest are mere phantasia.

1,"Daily exercise for taking control of one’s mind and body As in Stoic philosophy, the single most important practice is differentiating between what we can change and what we can’t, then rather falling into the trap of focusing too much on the external stimulus causing stress, you can direct your attention to your breath and say: ‘’Let’s calm down for a minute. I’m going to consciously slow down my breathing and take control of my mind and body.’’

By practising one simple breathing technique for managing stress one can experience a huge shift in their emotional as well as in their mental state. As a consequence, the given situation could be solved from a place of empowerment rather than feeling lost amid the incoming panic.

1,"Takeaways from On Old Age by Cicero (Stoic Views on How to Appreciate Getting Older) While not among his best known works, Cicero’s On Old Age (De Senectute) offers sagely advice on why one should not fear growing older. Quotes taken from the Loeb Classics Library translation. 

### 1. Old age is not unique in being burdensome…

&gt;*I think, my friends, that you marvel at a thing really far from difficult.* ***For to those who have not the means within themselves of a virtuous and happy life every age is burdensome****; and, on the other hand, to those who seek all good from themselves nothing can seem evil that the laws of nature inevitably impose.* ***To this class old age especially belongs, which all men wish to attain and yet reproach when attained; such is the inconsistency and perversity of Folly!***  
&gt;  
&gt;*They say that it stole upon them faster than they had expected. In the first place, who has forced them to form a mistaken judgement? For how much more rapidly does old age steal upon youth than youth upon childhood? And again, how much less burdensome would old age be to them if they were in their eight hundredth rather than in their eightieth year?* ***In fact, no lapse of time, however long, once it had slipped away, could solace or soothe a foolish old age****.*

### 2. … but it is only praiseworthy if the life preceding it was well spent…

&gt;*But bear well in mind that in this entire discussion* ***I am praising that old age which has its foundation well laid in youth****. Hence it follows — as I once said with the approval of all who heard it — that that old age is wretched which needs to defend itself with words! Nor can wrinkles and grey hair suddenly seize upon influence;* ***but when the preceding part of life has been nobly spent, old age gathers the fruits of influence at the last****.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*For if the ills of which they complained were the faults of old age, the same ills would befall me and all other old men; but I have known many who were of such a nature that they bore their old age without complaint, who were not unhappy because they had been loosed from the chains of passion, and who were not scorned by their friends.* ***But as regards all such complaints, the blame rests with character, not with age.*** *For old men of self-control, who are neither churlish nor ungracious, find old age endurable; while* ***on the other hand*** [***perversity and an unkindly disposition render irksome every period of life***](https://butwhatfor.substack.com/p/invert-always-invert-avoid-failure)*…*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Undoubtedly, Scipio and Laelius,* ***the most suitable defenses of old age are the principles and practice of the virtues****, which, if cultivated in every period of life, bring forth wonderful fruits at the close of a long and busy career, not only because they never fail you even at the very end of life — although that is a matter of highest moment — but also* ***because it is most delightful to have the consciousness of a life well spent and the memory of many deeds worthily performed****.*

### 3. … and the mind and body sufficiently prepared.

&gt;***But it is our duty, my young friends, to resist old age****; to compensate for its defects by a watchful care; to fight against it as we would fight against disease; to adopt a regimen of health; to practice moderate exercise; and to take just enough of food and drink to restore our strength and not to overburden it. Nor, indeed, are we to give our attention solely to the body;* ***much greater care is due to the mind and soul; for they, too, like lamps, grow dim with time, unless we keep them supplied with oil.***  
&gt;  
&gt;*For when Caecilius speaks of “ the old fools of the comic stage,” he has in mind old men characterized by credulity, forgetfulness, and carelessness, which are faults, not of old age generally, but only of an old age that is drowsy, slothful, and inert.*

### 4. If prepared in this way, old age contributes more to the world that it’s youth.

&gt;*Those, therefore, who allege that old age is devoid of useful activity adduce nothing to the purpose, and are like those who would say that the pilot does nothing in the sailing of the ship, because, while others are climbing the masts, or running about the gangways, or working at the pumps, he sits quietly in the stern and simply holds the tiller.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*He may not be doing what younger members of the crew are doing, but what he does is better and much more important.* [***It is not by muscle, speed, or physical dexterity that great things are achieved, but by reflection, force of character, and judgement***](https://medium.com/butwhatfor/perseverance-is-great-but-dont-forget-to-prepare-ea8d5fe7e6fb)*; in these qualities old age is usually not only not poorer but is even richer.*

### 5. Old age should not fear the nearness of death as it is not unique to old age…

&gt;***And yet is there anyone so foolish, even though he is young, as to feel absolutely sure that he will be alive when evening comes****? Nay, even youth, much more than old age, is subject to the accident of death; the young fall sick more easily, their sufferings are more intense, and they are cured with greater difficulty.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Therefore,* ***few arrive at old age****, and, but for this, life would be lived in better and wiser fashion. For it is in old men that reason and good judgement are found, and had it not been for old men no state would have existed at all.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*But I return to the question of impending death.* ***What fault is this which you charge against old age, when, as you see, it is one chargeable likewise to youth?*** *That death is common to every age has been brought home to me by the loss of my dearest son.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*They say, also, that the old man has nothing even to hope for.* ***Yet he is in better case than the young man****, since what the latter merely hopes for, the former has already attained;* ***the one wishes to live long, the other has lived long****.*

### 6. … and a life well lived lives well beyond its own years…

&gt;*The actor, for instance, to please his audience need not appear in every act to the very end; it is enough if he is approved in the parts in which he plays; and so* [***it is not necessary for the wise man to stay on this mortal stage to the last fall of the curtain***](https://butwhatfor.substack.com/p/takeaway-tuesday-knowing-history)*. For even if the allotted space of life be short, it is long enough in which to live honorably and well; but if a longer period of years should be granted, one has no more cause to grieve than the farmers have that the pleasant springtime has passed and that summer and autumn have come.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Would it not have been far better for me to spend a leisured and quiet life, free from toil and strife?* ***But somehow, my soul was ever on the alert, looking forward to posterity, as if it realized that when it had departed from this life, then at last would it be alive****.*

### 7. … with nothing to regret when its course has been run.

&gt;***For what advantage has life — or, rather, what trouble does it not have?*** *But even grant that it has great advantage, yet undoubtedly it has either satiety or an end. I do not mean to complain of life as many men, and they learned ones, have often done;* ***nor do I regret that I have lived, since I have so lived that I think I was not born in vain****, and I quit life as if it were an inn, not a home. For Nature has given us an hostelry in which to sojourn, not to abide.*  
&gt;  
&gt;***For as Nature has marked the bounds of everything else, so she has marked the bounds of life****. Moreover, old age is the final scene, as it were, in life’s drama, from which we ought to escape when it grows wearisome, and certainly, when we have had our fill.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Such, my friends, are my views on old age.* ***May you both attain it, and thus be able to prove by experience the truth of what you have heard from me****.*"

1,"What is the Stoic way of reaching a fulfilling life? Before I begin asking about the elephant in the room, I would like to express my gratitude to my fellow stoics of this sub for being the source of a quick Stoicism reference. Each of your posts filled with advices and quotes have really helped me in realigning my easily-astray, stoic mind. I thank you. 

Now to give you a little background of the question the crosses my mind; I am a M24, graduated just before the COVID19 halted the world. Not a good time to be a graduate as jobs are getting scarce as ever and people were in fact losing jobs. However I got a job but with only 169USD per month, it doesn’t even take me off the ground to where I wanted to go, which to pursue my passion project once I have enough money. At 24, living with parents with below minimum wage, even way below the poverty line of my country is stressing. No matter what people say, I still feel that I need to have more control and responsibility over my life, hence the urge to leave the house and live on my own is always there. But the situation with money restricts me. 

That’s about money mainly now we move on to the job that gives me money. 

As a research assistant cum admin assistant at a local university, the centre has to follow the recruitment flows which states that I will work here as a part-timer first. This comes without the confirmation of being permanent. I thought it was okay at first where I had the chance to prove myself. But as months went by, I feel that none of the things they do really matter to me. I started to lose focus and interest and getting off bed every morning only makes me dread it. My mind is now focused solely onto pursuing the passion project. 

Onto the passion project... 

Since COVID19 happened we all spent more time with our phones more than ever. It was during this time I started to fall in love with making videos for YouTube. Now in my mind I have it all layout for an educational/informative talking head style channel where my niche audience will be from my country mainly. Now I’m slowly setting up a recording corner in my bedroom where I can do the recordings. I will go on with this despite the occasional anxiety attack. However if I choose this as a career which I want, it will be unorthodox and indifference to the people I love especially my family. As conservative parents, they want me to work as a public servant getting pension when I’m old. I don’t think that’s what I want and all this dilemma really starting me to ask the big question. 

I feel as if things are not enough and I don’t have much time to get a happy, fulfilling life. So I ask you my fellow stoics, how do the great stoics look at this and is there a way to get things realigned in your life when things not yet go your way.

I thank you."
1,"What is a meningful discussion, how to facilitate one and how to cope with bores? I'm not looking for advice from The Fellows, but I'll begin with one:

&gt;\[33\] *In company take care not to speak much and excessively about your own acts or dangers: for as it is pleasant to you to make mention of your dangers, it is not so pleasant to others to hear what has happened to you.*  
— Epictetus

I've never liked watching sports, and even less about conversations about it. I don't judge people who are enthusiastic about sports, but even they struggle to have a meaningful discussion about it — because **having a meaningful discussion in any subject is a rare thing**. Why?

I'm looking to improve my understanding about good discussions and bounce my own ideas about them. I'd love for you to share your input — for that has the real potential of making the life of mine and others more wonderful.

---

&gt;*You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think.*  
— Marcus Aurelius

In stoicism, we bring the thing that is most farthests from us to the very center; remembering death shines light on life. I'd like to propose, that maybe the analogue is true in conversation.

My reading of Epictetus' quote is that we shouldn't talk about things we know, but rather, what we don't know. **Instead of staying inside the limits of our knowledge, we should continually strive to keep our ignorance at the center.** In practice, this means asking ourselves

* ""Why do I want to say this?""
* ""Why is this relevant to me?""
* ""How can I go deeper into what makes this meaningful to me?""

As listeners, we should facilitate a state like this in the speaker. We should stay mostly silent, yes, but I feel **we** ***must*** **speak when we are bored**, for then the speaker has usually lost their ignorance and is ruminating.

Additionally, in those kind of discussion where the speaker is examining their own experience or persona, **we should interrupt if we feel they missed a significant piece of ignorance**. I see it as if they're walking past a path that has sign that says ""This leads to \[obscured\], and it's probably more relevant than you'll get on your current path."" For example, if someone is thinking about their relationship and says ""...and then they laughed, as if I'm a child, and I got so angry and said..."" we should interrupt: ""I'm sorry, but why did you get angry? Is it not okay for you to behave like a child?"" In my experience, interruptions like these bring forth some new part of the person, which they might have not been aware of, thus increasing knowledge for both parties. Therefore...

**The aim of a discussion should be to increase knowledge about oneself or the world.** There are obvious exceptions, but what other worth can a discussion have? We can of course feel connected to a person even while talking about sports or food or how that one time we ate food while watching sports. This can increase warmth and strengthen the relationship and is usually seen as the (unconscious) motive of this kind of talk. But wouldn't a more meaningful discussion, one which leads to new personal discoveries, nourish the connection so much better?

But nourished we are not. People are ill-equipped for discussions like these, for it truly is a high mountain I want to climb. But discussing is a skill and skills can be learned and some can even be taught.

I regularly find myself amidst people who won't engage in a discussion. It's a bleak place. I have a habit of testing how I could facilitate a meaningful discussion, but I'll be honest here: the reluctance of most people to dive deep is making me depressed and sad. (Not like *depressed*, but you know what I mean.)

And I know that one of the old farts says

&gt;\[22\] *If you desire philosophy, prepare yourself from the be­ginning to be ridiculed, to expect that many will sneer at you* \[...\]  
— Epictetus

1,"Cutting contact with my brother  I am 22 years old and my brother is 28 years old. Our family owns a firm/factory. My brother is a very difficult person to deal with. He thinks that the universe revolves around him. He wakes up 3 pm in the evening and then comes to the factory. I go to the factory at 9 am. When asked why is he going to the factory so late he says that he will start going if he will own the factory and not our father. He wants the factory for himself and has said so in front of our family a thousand times. I cannot even think about owning the factory that my father worked so hard to make his entire lifetime. I will always work under him because he is the greatest man i know. My brother also dreams that he will become a billionaire ( not in a good way) and is obsessed with becoming rich. He talks about all the rich people and how they sit and eat . He thinks of himself highly and others as lowly creatures. He is not grateful for so many things our father and mother have done for us over the years, all the sacrifices they made. He does not want me to come to the factory my father made because he thinks that i am also a sharer in the will. He treats everybody like a peice of shit. He talks something else against the back of others and is something else in front of them. He does not even talk to my parents with respects, the same parents who sacrificed so much for us. He is ungrateful for all the things present in his life. He says that he wilm become very rich and powerful and he will become this and that but does nothing about it. He treats my sister like shit too.
She has stoped talking to him.

On one hand there was marcus aurelius who despite having all the power in the world practiced temperence , justice , courage and wisdom. And on the other hand there is my brother. The only thing i want is that atleast he does not disrespect my parents ( our parents ). There is nothing wrong with having dreams and working. But when you only talk that you will become this and that and you don't do anything in your life  and is a toxic person. My father told me that he will split the factory in two in 2-3 years. I am so fed up with all the fights that i don't ever want to see him again in my life. I just want peace and want to become a good virtuous human. I feel hurt when i say this but i wish that my brother was suppoetive of me and my family , we could have done a lot of stuff together. But he is just lost in his own dreams."

—EPICTETUS, DISCOURSES, 4.8.35b–37

Fooling with books so you can sound smart or have an intimidating library is like tending a garden to impress your neighbors. Growing one to feed a family? That’s a pure and profitable use of your time. The seeds of Stoicism are long underground. Do the work required to nurture and tend to them. So that they—and you—are prepared and sturdy for the hard winters of life."

""That is the answer to give to people whom death would actually come as a release. 'You are scared of dying? So you are alive, then, as you are?' """
1,"Reminder to Stoics to Keep Feeling and Stay Human (For simplicity, I use 'feeling' to describe sensations that can be reasoned with and controlled, and 'emotions' to describe those that can't be.)

It seems like some Stoics, bending the stick hard to one day be straight again, cut off all feeling in an attempt to control them, or for fear of their becoming emotions. But going to one extreme to ward off another, and the popular understanding of Stoicism as being something like this, is unStoic. 

&gt;This is the first promise that philosophy holds out to us: fellow-feeling, humanity, sociability. (Seneca, *Epistles*, 5.4.)  
&gt;  
&gt;I should not be unfeeling like a statue; I should care for my relationship both natural and acquired - as a pious man, a son, a brother, a father, a citizen. (Epictetus, *Discourses*, 3.2.4.)

Respecting feelings, Stoicism asks at least two things. That, one, whatever feelings you have should be genuinely yours.

&gt;Now, am I urging you to be hard-hearted, do I ask that you don't betray \[feelings\] at the funeral, do I refuse to let your spirit even be touched? Not at all. It would be barbarous, not courageous, to watch the burial rites of one's own - with the same eyes that watched them while living - and not be moved as one's family is torn apart. Suppose I did forbid it: some things have rights of their own. Tears fall even from those trying to hold them back; being shed, they lift the spirit. What, then, shall we do? Let us allow them to fall, but not order them to do so; let there be as much weeping as \[feelings\] may produce, not as much as imitation may demand. Let us add nothing to grief, not enlarge it to match the example of someone else. (Seneca, *Epistles*, 99.15.16.)

And, two, that you shouldn't let your feelings become emotions and cloud or do away with your ability to reason.

&gt;A man thinks himself injured, wants to be revenged, and then - being dissuaded for some reason - he quickly calms down again. I don't call this anger, but a mental impulse yielding to reason. Anger \[or any other emotion\] is that which overleaps reason and carries it away. (Seneca, *On Anger*, 4.)

As with everything, Stoicism asks for temperance and equanimity. That doesn't mean not feeling and not expressing your feelings (though you should serve the greater good by recognizing how your expressions affect people and that they might not be beneficial everywhere); you're human in a world filled with humans and should be conscious of the human need for feeling. But if you cry or yell, do it because, at no great cost to you or anyone, feeling catharsis or relief from it would make you feel better, and it would be better to not let bad feelings build up until they become a bad emotion. Laugh similarly, but know the cause of your laughter and a reason for making it, and be conscientious.

&gt;We should bring ourselves to see all the vices of the crowd not as hateful but as ridiculous; and we should imitate Democritus rather than Heraclitus. For the latter, every time he went out into public, used to weep; the former used to laugh. One saw everything we do as wretchedness, the other as absurdity. Things should be made light of, and taken more easily: it is more civilized to laugh at life than to bewail it. (Seneca, *On the Tranquility of Mind*, 15.2.)  
&gt;  
&gt;It is better to accept common behavior and human vices calmly, without bursting into either laughter or tears; for to be hurt by the sufferings of others is to be forever miserable, while to enjoy the sufferings of others is an inhuman pleasure. (15.5.)

Consider your good and bad feelings from different angles and consider their affects on you and the world, and judge whether their expression is virtuous, whether they serve the greater good. While all feelings should be had, not all expressions should be expressed. While the former should be controlled and reasoned with, the latter should be deliberate and useful."
1,"A great resource for learning about Stoicism is r/Stoicism. Here are some ways that I use r/Stoicism to learn about Stoicism and to learn how to apply Stoic principles to my daily life. 

1. I look at new posts and replies. I read many, and I spend time journaling, and sometimes researching other resources, about the topics of quite a few. 

2. I have posted a few times and I've replied a few more times. 

3. I use the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq) a lot. It's a great resource. The word search function has been very helpful. Even when I'm reading something other than r/Stoicism I will sometimes refer to the FAQ. There is a lot of information there. 

4. The search function for r/Stoicism is awesome. There are many years of posts and replies on this sub. Often these old replies will give information that is not a part of the current replies being offered for a particular post. ""How would a stoic handle FOMO?"" was a recent post that has been asked and answered many times, for example. And I often find links to old articles from Stoic writers who are still writing and teaching about Stoicism today. If you do not find any day's posts that suit your fancy, try searching for a word or phrase that you are interested in and see what others have said about it in the past. 

5. I like knowing that others have chosen a similar path to living the good life."

I have no clue if this is even the right subreddit for this, but I am trying to use the Stoic principles to not get overwhelmed right now. I have immense regret and fear and anxiety at the moment thinking about the infinite possibilities of what can happen ranging from best and worst case scenarios. 

Disclaimer: I take full responsibility over my actions. I should have assumed that my sneezing and congested nose wasn’t normal and a sign of something worse. I should have assumed worse case scenario and hunkered down until I knew what it was. I assumed it was nothing and now that false assumption brings me here. 

I don’t know if I have Covid or not I’ll have to wait till tomorrow to go and get checked out and then I’d have to wait 3-5 days to get the result. I am fearing for the future but I know I shouldn’t since the Stoics wouldn’t see it as a good use of time. But I’m struggling with the fact that I may have inadvertently hurt loved ones. How can I just move past that? How can I be stoic in the face of my atrocious behavior? 

Disclaimer 2: I live with my mom who doesn’t really care about the virus but I work at a grocery store (I’m 18) and I have no clue on whether it was me or her or her friend (who lives with us) that brought it (potentially cause we don’t know if it Covid).

1,"Why should I choose stoicism over nihilism? First off, I would say that I consider myself a stoic but I've been very nihilistic in the past. It seems to me that you can't really have stoicism without a little bit of nihilism. When stoics acknowledge how clear it is that not much matters in the bigger scale of things and that we're all going to die, this sounds almost exactly a nihilist would say. 

For me though, nihilism makes me depressed and stoicism makes me kind of bored and feel like I'm almost living pointlessly, as I'm just going on through life and trying to avoid suffering whilst not being able to get much real long-term joy either. I just go to school, which bores me, and stay at home on an afternoon to nighttime and then go to sleep. I don't have a girlfriend or much that I need to commit to. I have some friends but I see enough of them at school throughout the weekdays that I don't feel like I really need to talk to them much outside of school. For me, my life seems to revolve around being bored and thinking about stoicism or trying to get short-term pleasure from things that can just become addictive and in the end possibly cause more suffering to me than joy.

Nothing really goes extremely great for me and I just shrug it off, not feeling any happier, just slightly annoyed. I also have OCD which makes following stoic principles harder for me. Considering all of this, I don't really think stoicism has added much meaning to my life, it has just made me more depressed."

1,"”Never say of anything, ""I have lost it;"" but, "" I have restored it."" - Epictetus ”Never say of anything, ""I have lost it;"" but, "" I have restored it."" Has your child died? It is restored. Has your wife died? She is restored. Has your estate been taken away? That likewise is restored. "" But it was a bad man who took it."" What is it to you by whose hands he who gave it has demanded it again? While he permits you to possess it, hold it as something not your own; as do travellers at an inn.” - Epictetus, Enchiridion chapter 11.

I understand this quote but I don’t understand the part where he says, “what is it to you by whose hands he who gave it had demanded it again?” As in the bad man who gave them life also ceases it? 

Of course that which gives us life also gives us our death (nature). But here it sounds like he’s saying the bad man who demands their life again was the one giving it?"
1,"A Children’s Book So for 2 years now I’ve been on the path, I’ve seen some stuff for children regarding stoicism. I believe that Stoicism could be beneficial to young children as an introduction on how to behave when things go astray.  It is very hard to convey the stoic message to adults but children I feel are a good audience as they hold a few princesses naturally( compassion, kindness to others,etc). Well yesterday I was studying up on the stoic egg and got an idea to write a book for children with the stoic egg as the main character. My question is are there any parents that think this is something they would be into?"
1,Has anyone looked into ClassicalEducation as a supplement to a Stoic practice?

1,"Use your own mind. Control your own mind and don’t let others do it for you. Think critically about a situation and don’t simply react based on what you first hear. Think about what actions you want to take, and then proceed."
1,"I gave into lust and visited prostitutes. What should I do now? tldr; I visited independent prostitutes 3 times. I felt empty afterwards each time, so I quit it. Although now I don't think of sex as something foreign, but I paid for it and that feels fucked up. I never thought I'll go down this road, and now I cannot go back and change it.

I've never had sex before, and I was just getting tired of not finding anyone or waiting for arranged marriage.

So I paid for it and did it, more than once. I just didn't feel anything the first time, so I thought it's because I was nervous. But I felt equally empty the next time, and the next time.

So I stopped. Now I regret it. I know that I cannot do anything about the past now, but I can do right in the present. 

But still I can't help but regret my choices. Although the experience has opened my eyes, now I don't keep sex on a pedestal like I used to. And hence, I feel I've become less desparate about finding a girlfriend or getting married."
1,"Infidelity, rumors, lies, and Stoicism I must admit before I found The Stoic path I was far from virtuous. It was a lifestyle I was not raised to be part of, my parents raised me baptist and say what you will about Christianity. but I was very well aware of right from wrong.  I could blame this on my “friends” but it wasn’t their fault, we all have a choice and well I chose the path I was on. For years I blamed others for my issues, it’s my bosses fault, my parents, my sister, my friends, etc. when in reality it was mine. I have recently been studying stoicism heavy and not just the modern take on it but the whole of it, it’s origins, the logic (which I found out is basically the same logic we use today), ethics, and physics. In doing this I’ve gotten a deep understanding of what stoicism is and how to go about it, more so than Holiday or Kirby or Robertson could teach me in a book. I have a notebook filled with notes and scribbles. 
          Recently I found out a friend has been lied to, he was told that I was spreading false accusations about him. Now the me I was 3 years ago would have done this sure, but I haven’t said anything about him since we have met a year ago. He came up to me and was immediately angry and accused me of the crime, when I tried to tell him I was not guilty of his accusation he became furious and called me a “clown”. Now 3 years ago I would have cussed him and told him what an idiot he was, which would have led to a much bigger argument or a fist fight. This time I simply said that it wasn’t true and moved on, two days later he came up to me and apologized. I felt comfort in knowing that not allowing my initial emotional reaction to be the one I used in the situation helped to mend the problem. The “harm” others inflict or try to inflict on us is not of our concern it’s theirs.
         This brings me to my second situation, I found some messages from my wife to her “friend” and from her “friend” to her that Indicate a rather “friendly” relationship that I myself was unaware of. Now I used to be a jealous man, I would threaten to gouge our eyes and rip our throats (all idle threats of course). Now it’s been some time since I was like this(Highschool). Now I know I can not control her infidelity, and I do still love her with all the passion that I felt when we first met. My point i am making with this second bit is that I don’t feel the pain would feel with this revelation and I know that it isn’t due to a lack of love. I feel almost relieved that I was right which I know I shouldn’t. I’m not really looking for stoic advice so much as maybe some people to talk to about Stoicism with. ( she despises stoicism) I appreciate everyone who reads this long ass post and I would love to hear some opinions on my situations."
1,"How do you enrich a stoic practice when another person won't engage you? I posted this (below) in a Communist sub and was immediately banned. It didn't annoy me it confused me.

1,"Stoicism for a Better Life - Weekly exercise (September 30) Hello there, 

For this week’s exercise, I will look for inspiration from the Moral Letters of Seneca to Lucillius CVIII 27-27:

&gt;""Let us therefore set out whole-heartedly, leaving aside out many distractions and exert ourselves in this single purpose, before we realize too late the swift and unstoppable flight of time and are left behind. As each day arises, welcome it as the very best day of all, and make it your own possession. We must seize what flees.""""  

Pretty deep stuff for a letter between friends. But then again, this is why the Moral Letters of Seneca are so popular. They summarize a lot of the best points from his great body of work (which I highly recommend to any *Prokopton* looking for *prokopê*...or in English, anyone who is studying Stoicism to improve themselves.)

Although scientifically and mathematically we have proven spacetime to be a fabric and exist in its entirety already (yes...your future is already in the past of someone that exists today or existed before you), from our perspective space remains ""spatial"" and time marches on in one direction. This relentless march goes on until our perspective ceases to exist (i.e. we die). This perception of time is an illusion of our consciousness, but all this fancy science does not change the simple fact that, as far as we can tell, we grow old and then we die. And there is nothing we can do to change that (yet).

Time is our most precious resource, so don't waste it. Make the most of it. And making the most of it does not mean eat the most whatever you love, and do the most whatever is fun. Make the most of it means this: What will make you happy and truly proud when you're on your deathbed looking back at your life? Whatever that is, do more of that. Much more of it. 

**So as a practical exercise this week, try a eulogy exercise.** If you are unfamiliar with this, basically you imagine your future funeral and write your own eulogy. Or, you can try and imagine being on your own death bed (as aforementioned) and list out the things that your future dying self would be proud of, or would wish to have done more of. Whatever exercise you do and however you **identify what is truly important to you, do more of that.**

If you feel like it, share what you identified. This may help inspire others as well.

1,"How did you die? (Poem by Edmund Vance Cooke) Did you tackle that trouble that came your way
With a resolute heart and cheerful?
Or hide your face from the light of day
With a craven soul and fearful?
Oh, a trouble's a ton, or a trouble's an ounce,
Or a trouble is what you make it,
And it isn't the fact that you're hurt that counts,
But only how did you take it?

You are beaten to earth? Well, well, what's that?
Come up with a smiling face.
It's nothing against you to fall down flat,
But to lie there -- that's disgrace.
The harder you're thrown, why the higher you bounce;
Be proud of your blackened eye!
It isn't the fact that you're licked that counts,
It's how did you fight --  and why?

And though you be done to the death, what then?
If you battled the best you could,
If you played your part in the world of men,
Why, the Critic will call it good.
Death comes with a crawl, or comes with a pounce,
And whether he's slow or spry,
It isn't the fact that you're dead that counts,
But only how did you die?

1,"Stoic approach to a friend refusing to pay me? I am sharing a house with friends for the university year. Before we moved in we agreed on how the bills were to be split. However, when it came the day to pay one friend decided to minus $40 from the amount he owed me as he ""no longer felt like paying me that much"". 

How do I approach this situation? From reading meditations I believe I'm supposed to let it go and hold no grudge for it. However I feel this borders the line between being a pushover and being stoic.

I would feel differently if he simply owed me money and took a while to pay it but the blatant refusal on no logical grounds is disrespectful. The fact that he can't keep his word on an agreement involving money struck amongst friends. Especially considering we have been friends for years. I also know he is not wanting for money, he is the most privileged and well off by far of the household.

The complicated part in all this is I still have to live with this person for a year and my initial reaction is I no longer want anything to do with him.

Any guidance or input would be appreciated. Thank you."
1,"A Question on Marcus Aurelius' Writing A few weeks ago, these thoughts came to me, like it's hard to work with each other and that I would not want to stay in society any longer. In most institutions and organizations, there's probably someone controlling how things work in a corrupt way. I feel like we live in a system where the government is constantly exploiting us, where honest hard work won't be enough, where where there is authority and power, the possibility of someone taking that all for himself will always exist and I do not want to be a part of it. 

Now, I have been mildly practicing Stoicism since January 2020 after stumbling upon Marcus Aurelius' work, Meditations, 3 years ago randomly at a bookstore and I have a question,

**How would one deal with these thoughts?**

Because as I have observed, most of Marcus Aurelius' writings are about Nature and Cosmos and how we must work together because we are 'made' for working together.

\*I always try to center my thoughts around Stoicism (but I also incorporate other philosophies that work for me),"

1,What is stoicisms view on influencing others? For sure there is a rational reason to want to influence but it seems things become exponentially emotionally complex when you want to influence or convince others. How does stoicism address this challenge? 
1,"Personal journey: Stoicism is easy, change feels hard It's not like I'm *learning* stoicism, but rather, that I'm *yielding* into it. Especially after reading Enchiridion, I have this sense of urgency, as if the time has come. But time for what? It's now 9:45 in the morning and lunch I will attend to later. So then what? What is this thing I'm yearning to do? No, not to do — *to be*.

&gt;\[51\] How long, then, will you put off thinking yourself worthy of the highest improvements and follow the distinctions of reason? \[...\]

I've become aware of this small weight I'm carrying with me. Not so heavy, but long, as if penetrating back in time. But is this burden but a part of me? For I've been a restless soul, a temperate one, not in the sense of moderation, but in the sense of heat and haste. More than my behaviour, I've found this in the contents of my mind and speech.

Have I been a person of principle and virtue? Sometimes. Do I know what is right and still give into what is easy and pleasurable? But then again, where goes the line: is excess anything but bread, olives and water, with maybe a piece of cheese every now and then? I'm okay adding chocolate to the list, but cheese puffs are hard to justify, and yet (again) I'm salivating.

&gt;\[...\] You have received the philosophical theorems, with which you ought to be familiar, and you have been familiar with them. What other master, then, do you wait for, to throw upon that the delay of reforming yourself? \[...\]

Not buying cheese puffs is easy but being a person abstaining from what is familiar, feels new. Being more mindful of what I say is easy, but how tiresome (more now than before) it is to be amidst people who babble. So, it's not that doing The Right Thing© is hard, but leaving old parts of me behind, is.

For me and for now, stoicism is a name for a process of growth. And with inner growth, it is like it is with children. I'm a parent and I don't know what my child will grow into. And no better do I know what this process of mine turns me into. There is no peeking into the future. But I know that getting there means that I'll be leaving big parts of ""the old me"" behind. It is an exchange where I give things that I know for things that are unknown. This is what I mean by yielding. And what excuse I have not to yield fully, not to urge myself forward towards the unknown?

&gt;\[...\] This instant, then, think yourself worthy of living as a man grown up, and a proficient. Let whatever appears to be the best be to you an inviolable law.  
— [Epictetus](https://enchiridion.tasuki.org/display:Code:ec/section:51)

1,"Virtue: Subjective or Objective? Greetings everyone. As a new Stoic immersing myself in as much as I can, I notice the word ""virtue"" pop up quite a bit.  
I know that virtue is what Stoics strive for, and virtue in a Stoic sense is merely an excellence of character.  


My question is, is virtue a single objective thing we should reach, or is virtue different for everyone based on our values?"
1,"SENECA, MORAL LETTERS, 33.7 “For it’s disgraceful for an old person, or one in sight of old age, to have only the knowledge carried in their notebooks. Zeno said this . . . what do you say? Cleanthes said that . . . what do you say? How long will you be compelled by the claims of another? Take charge and stake your own claim—something posterity will carry in its notebook.”"
1,"What are your thoughts on the quote: 'We all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinions than our own' This quote by Marcus Aurelius has always stuck with me; i even have it on my wall. I've learned so much on this subreddit that i'd like to ask for your opinions ;)

I'm a bit conflicted about to what degree the underlying 'advice' is the right thing to live by in regards to gathering knowledge. I get the feeling that the value of the opinion of others is somewhat underestimated.

I used to value my opinion very much, because i don't easily form opinions; I do my research, and because of that i used to be fairly certain that (on average) i had more knowledge on the topics i discussed and therefore the more informed opinion. A very arrogant and to others annoying habit!  

A big part of that research however actually consists of the opinion or thought experiments of others. Even the works of the ancient stoïcs are in a way well thought out opinions with a theme. Marcus Aurelius was a scholar and a teacher, but he learned from his teachers, and they from their teachers and so on. He used that input to form his own opinions on things. I find it hard to believe he disregarded what others said because he perceived them as less intelligent or simply disagreed with them. 

So apart from the social value of caring about what others think of you; aren't our thoughts a synthesis of all the opinions around us? Maybe even moreso in a time where 'factual' knowledge was less available. When is your opinions yours?

I think if 10 people were to look at the same little piece of information, they all process it differently and take different lessons from it based on who we are (eduction, background, age, gender etc.). Why shouldn't i value the opinions of those other 9 over my own? 

Now maybe i read to much into it and is this quote more about 'Focus on what you can control'. 

Curious what you guys think about this."
1,"Opinions You have no authority over the opinions others hold. We all have our opinions. It is just how we personally perceive things. But opinions are not just some random thing; they are simply the view which one takes. And what may affect how they see these things? Simply how they were brought up and the environment they live in. So to each person, if you can, see who they are exactly; “how does he commonly respond/approach certain things? what environment did she come from? to what kind of people are they surrounded by?” The point of this is so you can understand why they might have such opinions. How can you blame these people then? The opinion holder is just ignorant, and therefore is not necessarily targeting you but rather acting in their ignorance. Do not, though, immediately assume one’s own opinion or view to be false though. Before you strip the person naked and see who they really are, you should apply their remark to reason. That is to rationalise with that which they said. Calculate how accurate or likely it is, or how logical it sounds. Somebody tells you that sugar is an utter evil food that one must at all costs avoid. Now reason with this. And if you do this properly you should  be able to respond in your own mind; “but in what point of time did someone experience terrible illness or death from a little sugar? And what about a balanced diet? What is wrong with it? Sure, too much of sugar is bad, but sugar itself is nothing to discriminate about.

So, now you must respond to one’s opinion thus correcting their inaccuracy. No, not at all. In fact, why do you need to?  You certainly have the right to share your opinion to this person if you shall, only be aware that he or she might have an opinion about your response! So you must foresee this and accept it; remembering that this is but an opinion. The aim is not to convince someone otherwise, for you yourself cannot alter their perspectives without their cooperation. And if this person wills debate, it is neither wise to respond to their statements with a statement of your own, nor will it make any difference to how they see things. Because they have no interest to consider your words. Their only interest is to express their thoughts and beliefs; and further to ignore or find fault with what belief anyone else shares. Therefore, unless someone accepts the opinions of others, moreover is open to take it into consideration, then he or she may completely despise your words and make debate. And if you know that this person has such a routine then, why do you see it plausible to bother? But in the opposite course, the person may consider your say and think, “yes, that sounds rather accurate and so I now see the thing differently.” But it was not you that altered their perception. It was they who decided to listen and to consider your response, and furthermore to adapt it for themselves."
1,"Tips on how to avoid getting affected by thinking about negative scenarios Hello, fellow stoics, and stoics-in-training. I needed help with a particular trait of mine that makes life hell for me at times.  
  
I am the kind of person who thinks a lot about different scenarios that might arise out of a particular situation, and how I can deal with them as and when they arise. This trait helps me, because it allows me to have a solution ready for different situations.  
  
However, it has also made life tough for me at times because I imagine certain scenarios that are quite scary, and once I imagine those scenarios, they take hold of my mind, and I become really tense (so much so that I am unable to think of solutions to such scenarios). That impacts my mental well-being too, sometimes.  
  
Are there any ways in Stoicism that can allow me to continue anticipating different situations, but not get so affected by the scary ones? This trait of mine can be looked at in two ways, from previous posts on this subreddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/cfqyla/suffering_from_anticipation/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/f01inb/the_person_who_has_anticipated_the_coming_of/). How do I strike a balance between the two? How do I anticipate things, yet not allow the truly bad ones to affect me, psychologically?  
  
Thank you in advance, hope you have a lovely day and week ahead."
1,"Worrying about things outside your control will just waste mental energy and thought that could otherwise be directed toward your goal of being more virtuous in ways that are within your control This occurred to me today and although it seems obvious now, it wasn't before and it helped me shift my perspective in a way that has helped me break through some mental barriers. 

You see, before this thought I had tried to not worry about things outside my control just simply for the reason that they are outside my control and therefore it is pointless to worry about them. This certainly helped and worked in a variety of situations, but it mostly just appeals to my logic and proved to be less effective in persuading my emotional self on the stickier situations. For example, I still found myself worrying about other people I knew who were more successful than me. I would repeat to myself ""fame and success depend on many factors outside our control,"" and every 10th repetition or so of that mantra it would make me feel a bit better for a while, but my subconscious would keep circling back to it again later.

But, then I had the thought written in the title. This is different from not worrying about things simply because they are not within our control. That leaves open-ended the question of “well what to do then with my mental energy?” Remembering in that same moment that my ever-present goal is to be as virtuous as possible helps me to fill the hole otherwise left behind by removing those worries with efforts to be better myself and pursue my goals in ways that are within my control. I can't just tell my mind ""don't worry""; I have to give myself a purpose too. Something else to think about and focus my attention on. Something to positively act on.

I had already also been telling myself to have the goal of being virtuous, from Stoic readings. But somehow I hadn't properly connected the two. Now they come as one thought: don't worry about things outside of my control *and instead* focus my attention and efforts on things that are within my control, to further my goal of being as virtuous as possible. I'll have to see if this stands the test of time or has just been a temporary false-epiphany. But, for the last couple days this slight revision of thought has yielded much better results, particularly for my more challenging mental situations.

That all said, I'm totally open to criticisms and suggestions if others think there is a flaw in my perspective, or a way that it could be further improved. You won't rain on my parade."
1,"Need advice on Economic Future How do you deal with not overthinking about the country's economic future. I just watched the presidential debates. It was comical. But honestly, it was also concerning. Because all of this has interrelated effects that trickle down into society.

As a citizen who wants to be informed to some extent (but not too informed because watching the news these days can push people into deep depression), I am really saddened and concerned about the country's economic future. This affects us all at the end of the day - i.e. affect's one's ability to get a job to put food on the table if we continue into a Great Depression. Poor leadership from both parties and liberals overreacting and wanting to shut down the world for the flu (Covid) is slowly revealing its effects. Look at NYC and its wave of bankruptcies and trash piling up on the street. Etc. Etc.

What can one do as a Stoic here? Am I the only one who feels this way? Need advice."

“Matt, do you ever think about infinity?” I ask my roommate who’s lazing on the red sofa, sipping his ritualistic morning coffee and scrolling on his phone. 

“In what regard?” he replies, only half paying attention. I spin my armchair around to face him. Green and blue light from his Instagram feed flash in his glasses.

“Well, sometimes it’s like I can feel myself expanding with the universe, and there’s this rush of energy that threatens to rip me apart,” I clarify, fishing for eye contact. He furrows his brows, sets his phone down, and meets my gaze.

“I usually think of God in regards to the infinite. Can’t say I’ve thought about it like you, DJ. It makes my head hurt just hearing about it,” he says. He slides his glasses up his nose and takes another sip.

“Headaches tend to happen when you start thinking or talking about infinity long enough,” I admit with a small chuckle.

“Maybe it’s a sign,” he warns with a side-eyed smirk.

“Of what?” I ask with curiosity.

“That we, as finite, mortal beings, shouldn’t be exploring this stuff,” he says.

“A sign from who? Or what?” I ask, inching a bit forward.

“God probably. Maybe it hurts because we’re on a track we shouldn’t be on, like walking towards the tree with the forbidden fruit,” he says, gesturing with his hand.

“So what?” I prod.

“We should stop before God or something else arrives and brings divine punishment on our sorry asses, like the fall of Adam and Eve,” he says with finality. I let this sink in for a moment. He picks up his phone and starts scrolling again.

“God is supposed to be everywhere, all knowing, and all powerful, right?” I ask.

“Sure,” he shrugs.

“Alright, so, how does he do it? What is his method?” I ponder. He sighs in frustration and sets his phone down.

“It’s God we’re talking about here, He works in mysterious ways. Perhaps it’s supposed to *remain* mysterious for us humans,” he says.

“What if every single atom, every tiny particle, was like a tiny eye of god, and that’s how he does it?” I ask. He laughs.

“I think you’re thinking too hard. What would you do about it even if that were the case? What *could* you do about it?” he poses.

“Well...I don’t know. But it would be like the ultimate spy network bro, no one could escape from his sight no matter where they went, because *everything* would be made up of his eyes, even our bodies! Which would mean, in a sense, we are-”

“Dude, my head hurts, I’m done,” he interrupts, returning to his phone and coffee. Damn, just when it was getting good, too. I sigh out my sadness.  I spin my armchair around, returning to Epictetus’ *“Discourses”* on my computer.

“You, on the other hand, *are* a creature placed in charge, and a particle of God himself; there is a bit of God within you,” I read to myself. Well, by that logic, we as humans would have a divine, infinite nature within, making god a greater infinity than us. Would it be possible for me to ascend beyond god, by becoming an even greater infinity than him?

What would that be like? A wave of guilt washes over me, like I was just caught with my hand in the cookie jar. It feels heavy. I cross my arms and sulk a bit.

“Wait, what do I even have to feel guilty about?” I say to myself, shaking it off. I sit up, returning my attention to my computer. Someone taps me on the shoulder. “What?” I ask, turning around to see...no one?

“I didn’t say anything,” my roommate says. Ya, and he didn’t move from the couch either. And Shelly isn’t home. A cold shiver runs down my spine as I turn to my research once again.

Something slithers like worms on wet noodles behind me. Fear freezes my whole body. My eyes grow wide. My breath shortens.

Something...something is slithering on my shoulders! Guilt, depression, and existential dread sink deep into me. It’s like when I dream of horrific monsters: the fear paralyzes me in its grip. I’m too scared to even breathe.

Every fiber in my being tells me not to turn around, to pretend that I feel nothing. I can’t do that. I have to look. I must know.

My hands grow cold and clammy. Sweat beads on my forehead. Me breath quickens as I swivel my armchair around. My jaw drops in awe.

A giant, wretched eye has opened on the wall, red veins bleeding from its canthi into the ceiling and floor like jagged branches and roots. Its pupil is a portal, a doorway into the infinite expanse beyond our three dimensions. Out of this portal writhes innumerable tendrils with black slime that patters on the ceiling like rain, seeping death’s stench into the room. I can feel its sentience; it knows I’m here.

“Bro...bro, do you see this?” I whisper, noting the tendrils as they slither over my body.

“See what?” he asks, glued to his phone. How can he not see this? We’re facing in the same goddamned direction!

“Matt…” I whisper, tears welling in my eyes. Its tendrils slither under my shirt and bore into my stomach. I can feel it writhing under my skin, sucking everything out. Oh god, he was right!

“What do you think you actually are?” the question burns into my mind with a trillion voices saying it all at once. I can feel it now - I’m dissolving into everything, becoming one with the universe. I am not my body, my ego, or my emotions…I...I…

“I am that I am,” I realize. My words echo and reverberate through the air, cracking reality like fine crystal. My heart ignites with courage that explodes forth as divine, prismatic light. In an instant holy fire burns the wretched tendrils into glowing embers. Daemonic shrieking pierces the air as the eye writhes in pain.

Hot air rushes about the room as massive heat waves escape my body. My clothes evaporate. I levitate off the chair as electricity burns my injuries away, leaving healthy tissue in the flames’ wake. 

Looking at my hand is like looking into the depths of the Sun, except that the light doesn’t hurt my eyes. I can see beyond the surface, where infinite fractals endlessly loop over and over each other. I can see with every part of my being. Like the Phoenix, I am reborn.

This heat, this power...I’ve never felt so alive! So euphoric. So complete.... 

“Not even god has the power of coercion over us,” I quote. I turn my gaze to the eye, and watch as my power withers it away like a slug buried in salt and set ablaze, until nothing but ashes remain. 

“Matt,” I say, my voice echoing. I turn to him. He’s slumped on cinders. Half of him is scorched, the other half drenched in blood; his coffee is nowhere to be found.

I have finally reached enlightenment. Yet, at the same time, my infinite nature has burned my friend to death. I am simultaneously hero and monster, good and evil. Truly, with infinity all things are possible.

Walking on tongues of prismatic flame, I make my way over to my friend. Life has escaped what’s left of his eyes. He’s gone dark; no one’s home. Curious to see what happens, I place a scintillating hand on his head and command with all that I am,

“Illuminate.”"
1,"How do I deal with constant thoughts of my unrequited love? I've discovered stoicism a while back and I felt it all sat so well with me, and I've used this philosophy to soothe my mind many times and regarding many topics before, however, I can't seem to be able to implement it when it comes to romance.

In short, I'm in this some sort of FWB situation with a man I love very deeply, not only in a romantic way, but in every way, which is why I'm wanting to stay in contact with him. We've been in each others lives on and off for nearly 2 years now, and it's clear he sees me only as a friend, which logically, is completely fine by me, however, emotionally it's been very painful. The outcome I'm wishing upon this situation is for myself to either ""fall out of love"" and continue our friendship as a friendship like any other, or be able to remove the weight off of the emotion I feel towards him, I mean, keep loving him the way I do if I have no choice, but be indifferent to the emotion. This would've been easy to deal with  if my mind wasn't so occupied with him.

I will deal with the emotional pain, that's not an issue. What I do need help with is, how do I stop thinking of him? us? It feels like over time I had forgotten how to think of and about anything else, it's a little embarassing to admit, but he's honestly on my mind around 90% of the time. What I'm really asking for is perhaps if anyone has any ideas for specific books or articles or anything stoic related, even some sort of ""brain exercises"", or just advice? 

Thank you in advance. ♥"

1,"Approach when encountering ""Or else""? So you get into a mild confrontation, confronting a dude that bothers you in one way or another,you confront him respectfully and in a stoic way telling him to stop. But he says those two words ""Or else/what?"", this question that lead many men into a physical confrontation, striving to show their dominance.
 What would be the wise approach here that would lead to you getting the respect you deserve, and get rid of the bothersome dude?"
1,"Passed my first test of will since starting my journey down the Stoic path I'm sharing this story because I'm proud of myself and wanted to share some of my personal growth without telling the people close to me of what occurred. I started my Journey down the Stoic path only about a month ago when I bought few books about the subject after really struggling with guilt of how I have behaved in the passed, the quarantine had just given me too much time to think. In the passed I've made bad decisions specifically related to instant gratification an pleasure without concern for the pain it caused others and myself. 

I'm referring to being unfaithful in a previous relationship, at the time I did all kinds of mental gymnastics to justify it and when the relationship ended for other reasons I still hung on to that guilt but continued to behave poorly. This went on for a while until I met the woman who is now my wife and I decided she was worth growing up over, I was 23 when I met her and we dated for two years before I asked her to marry me. The relationship has been great, she's been everything I've ever asked for, I have never been unfaithful towards her and we got married in December right before the quarantine started. 

I always considered myself emotionally weak and thought I'd fall back in to the same bad habits I had before I met her so what I would do is simply avoid the possibility of temptation. I avoided going out without her, drinking, and would avoid being alone with women when in a social setting. I know this all sounds a bit extreme but that's how little I thought of myself, it's not that I though I would charm any women I was alone with it's that I thought I might try and that's enough to ruin relationships. 

Anyways last week I left town to accompany my father to his home town to spend time with my grandfather. The test came when my cousin invited me out to hang out with some of his friends, he's a doctor who said it was safe and we where in a small town so I figured COVID wasn't an issue. My Grandparents already contracted the disease and survived it with relative ease so I wasn't worried about infecting them, they have the antibodies. We went out to a lagoon where we met up with a few guys and several girls, I was wearing my wedding ring so I thought that would immediately make cheating not an option since it would be extremely obvious I'm married, however two girls didn't seem to care very much about this. My cousin took one of them to ""use the bathroom"" in his car but they didn't come back for and hour so I was left pretty much alone with the other one when everyone else went in the water or separated off in to their own conversations.

What I would normally do in this situation is find an excuse to get out of it or torpedo my own chances. However the wedding ring didn't work and my cousin took the car, then I remembered something I read. I'm sorry if I butcher this but in ""The Beginners guide to Stoicism"" I read about how one has control of their own desires. How I should desire only what I can always have and desire to avoid what I can always avoid. I always have control of my actions, this 100lbs girl in front of me had no control over my will or desires. I desired to avoid being unvirtuous and unfaithful and no matter how much someone tempts me I can't truly be tempted if I just don't desire to have sex with them. Once that clicked in my head it was actually pretty easy, I actually had a pretty enjoyable conversation with her and after a while she opened up about her own issues and why she was being so forward. I truly didn't desire her physically because now I viewed her as a young girl with a poor decision making process. 

The conversation shifted towards me giving her a few tips to help her out, I even recommended a couple books to her. I recommended the previously referenced ""Beginners guide to Stoicism"" by Matthew Van Natta and ""The Daily Stoic"" by Ryan Holiday and Stephen Hanselman. I'm not very far in to my journey so I really just regurgitated what I had read but I'm amazed I was able to apply what I had read so quickly and effectively. I'm excited to see how else I can apply what I'm learning and continue to grow since I still have a long way to go but just knowing I had the strength to view the situation clearly and shift my mindset is a huge moral booster."

1,"How does one strive to do better every day yet not be bogged down by the feeling of being unsatisfied? I was reading ""Mindfulness in Plain English"" and came across this passage in the first few pages.

&gt; Just because of the simple fact that you are human, you find yourself heir to an inherent unsatisfactoriness in life that simply will not go away. You can suppress it from your awareness for a time; you can distract yourself for hours on end, but it always comes back, and usually when you least expect it.

In retrospect, this is so obvious, but I had to stop reading the book and reflect on it because I realized that the feeling of being unsatisfied has been the cause of most stress in the past few months in my life.

I tried to look at it from a Stoic lens. What I see is that I should not think about what I cant control, but focus on what I can. 

But I find that the two are paradoxical and am looking to make sense out of it. 

I want to do the best that I can in life, which would also mean that I shoould rigorously pursue and work hard on things that I can control. However, pursuing it, does leave a feeling of being unsatisfied always.

What do the Stoics say about this, if anything?"
1,"Yesterday it hit me, the clock of time is ticking, but the end is nowhere in sight. Yesterday was a pretty timid day, nothing out of the ordinary. I was sitting in class, our schools guidance counselor came in at the end of the lesson to talk about future careers and the choices we have after high school. I was sitting at the back of class, not really paying any attention. Just thinking. Then I hear her say “As you only have roughly half a year left in high school, you need to choose your path. University applications will be sent in early March”. 

Then it hit me, all the goals I have, the things I’ve dreamt about and what I’ve wanted to achieve. It’s not far away, while time was passing on an everyday basis I was worrying about non-essential things, people’s thoughts about me, social anxiety, what I was going to do after the lesson etc. all of those thoughts, they don’t matter, the things that plague me don’t matter. In 3 months I will have forgotten about them anyway. 

The list of goals I have, my dreams, ambitions and everything I want to do. It’s all after high school, something I imagined doing in my 20s. The worries of today don’t matter, who cares what other think of you, who cares about rumors going around about you, who cares about being rejected by a girl 1 year back and still have it infecting your mind like an ever growing cancer. None of it matters, in 2 years I will have forgotten about it. The only thing I need to make right is that I learn from the mistakes I and others made. So I may evolve more as a person. 

Have any of you had a moment where it just “hit” you?"
1,"Virtue for me it's like a chain. Each link - virtious choice. One weak link and the whole chain is broken. And this is why to emportant to align every moment with stoicism, because even choice about the smallest thing like ""Can I eat that brownie just because I want it, not because I am hungry"" will broke that chain. 

It's not even about health it's about a building a solid structure with each choice and each moment of existence. To achieve a flow of life."
1,"IS SUICIDE A OPTION TO END INTERNAL SUFFERING ? m19 here, I would like resume my nasty life and how at this point of my life, the only option left for me it's suicide.

I grow up in Italy but iam from India. From the beginning I was in video games and stuff that increase my dopamine, along with games and films I was introduced by the first females of my youth.

I remember being so attracted to these cute creatures and all the romantic stuff.

At the age of 12 I have being introduced by my best friend to porn.
I remember how I was disgusted by those explicit and disturbing scene.

But slowly slowly my curiosity got the better of me and I end up getting more deeper and deeper in the hardcore stuff.

Had terrible social anxiety, no confidence, no connection with anyone, a total mess.

At the age of 17 I met this girl on app called ""Ask"" and from there we starting clicking very well, I was really into her and was very open with my thoughts and feelings.

We get together and my porn addiction ceased for those months, she was amazing, caring, cute, patience. 
she liked my humor and my funny side, I always make her laugh at anytime any mood she was.
You know that kind of feeling where you feel to be in heaven and so fucking happy, yeah.

Fast forward to 4 months she started to notice my neediness and subconsciously started to get less attracted to me. Back then I was innocent and too young to understand the side effect of loving someone so fucking deeply to take a bullet for her.
We broke up.

I restarted my masturbation sessions again, I can't believe but I ended up looking at bisexual stuff cuz the normal porn wasn't so exciting for me....

Now in this moment iam here, more knowledge more fit then I ever was,  

My ex and I have talked in these few years about how things have been changed and how now she is me kind of Greek Demi God.

But truly inside I know that I have thirsty demon of lust that I can't control it over then 2 weeks.

Now she is with another guy, I have seen her WA profile pic, I was trying to get some fuel to back my life together. But I know that Seneca would slap me in to the face...to getting anger and sadness in fuel.

1,"The idea of the self in stoicism A lot of stoicism revolves around the idea of what ""we"" can control, but I'm a bit confused regarding what the stoics meant when they referred to ""us"" and ""we"". My current understanding is that the reason that the stoics placed so much emphasis on the rational mind and our ""reason"" is that is our self, as it is the only thing we can truly control. Is that true, or am I misunderstanding things?"
1,"Pursuing fame is like building a castle in the sand We don't know how long the castle will last.

It might last 1 day. It might last 1,000,000 years.

We only know one thing. Eventually the castle will be washed away. Reduced to sand.

When some other guy walks along the beach in X (insert arbitrary number here) years, the sand used to build the castle will be as good as any other sand. Nobody will be able to tell that this sand was once used for a castle. Nobody will even know that the castle once existed.

Now, this doesn't mean that you shouldn't build a castle. If your nature as a human being is to build a castle, then you should do so. 

But if you do it for fame, you are not being rational, because eventually your once famous sand will be as good as any other sand. 

If people would think a little further ahead in time, we could end a lot of the suffering in this world. The problem is that we, as humans, tend to be incredibly short-sighted."
1,"Virtue in Stoic ethics  Where is the line in ""virtue"" supposed to be drawn? Can't it be argued that any action you do to benefit yourself is unvirtuous in nature as it steps on other people? Does this not result in the Stoic getting the shorter end of the stick at all times?

&amp;#x200B;

Few examples: I'm in an abusive relationship, wouldn't it be unvirtuous of me to leave the abusive partner because they ""cannot live without me""? And if I leave it will hurt them.  

Wouldn't it be unvirtuous of me to try and get a promotion over another co-worker?

Wouldn't it be unvirtuous if I choose myself over someone else in any situation at all?

This has really been weighing on me because I'm quite convinced by Stoicism, I just don't know how to reconcile this difference."

1,"I'm tired of myself I'm 20(M) and I'm a law student. Long story short I am having huge anxiety problems. I always feel like I don't belong at my college. I'm always very hard on myself. Usually, I used to grab every opportunity which is in my hand but now since I got into stoicism, I haven't been really using every opportunity and labelling it as betterment for my mental health I have become lazier. There's a moot competition culture in law schools where you'd represent the college competing with other colleges in dealing with cases. My whole self-worth was put into that I know it's not the right thing to do but my college culture has this atmosphere that if you're good with moots you would be a good lawyer. I want to succeed something in my life. All my life I have been an imposter trying to fit in every place I go to. My dad is not proud or happy of me taking law since he has his own selfish reasons that I'd get separated from him. Also, he wants me to look after his business which I clearly don't want to. It feels like it's been a mistake that I took law since I don't feel like I belong there, my parents aren't really proud, I don't even have the required skills. All my mates are so talented and great that it cripples the fuck outta my anxiety. 
Idk what's the state here, my close friend sees me as a competition and it sucks. It has drained our relationship. We together planned to start a law journal together but he did it with someone else and it hurts like hell for me. Idk I feel neglected and bad. I make up my mind that it's all his ego for competing with me but deep down I know for a fact that it's his life his choices who am I to say him to start the journal with me.

Today another best friend of mine wants to do moot with another team and this seems okay and normal but I'm fully hurt since we actually planned to do it together. Now he left me  I'm so fucking down and I feel like  I'm in rock bottom. I don't even feel like picking up my own team and start it I'm just way too tired and lazy for that.

My future is uncertain I don't even know what he fuck I'd do. I badly need money to move out and have a good life. Considering my degree it takes a lot of time to settle down and earn well. Thinking all about this uncertainty gives me great anxiety. I am familiar with the stoic quotes that if you do not have control over something, do not worry about it and all that stuff but it just gives me temporary relief to a permanent problem.

I always feel like I'm having trust issues with everyone. I broke up with my girlfriend last year and I used to be the guy who's always surrounded by friends and popular but now all I want to be is alone and I keep pushing people away from my life. I want to deal with this anxiety alone because every person I have trusted has ended up betraying me or using my weaknesses to their advantage. Idk if I'm overreacting but it sucks and I have lost faith in trusting people. It's like if someone does something to me it's not even bothering me and it seems like I saw it coming. Now this pandemic has made me feel more anxious and uncertain. Now the online classes have improved, moots have been conducted online but I still don't have the force to try it online since I find it super lame to argue online (maybe I am giving reasons for my laziness) but the friend who a abandoned me told the same reason and now he is doing it with another team. It seems like everything is going to be online for a few months so I should get used to all the stuff to be done online. I don't feel like doing it. 
At home, I'm pressurized by my dad to help him with his work and he would threaten me that if I'm not of any use for him, he would stop helping me or pay for my college. At the other hand, I have not been listening to college classes, not participating in anything related to college work. All I'm doing is surf through Reddit and also learn random stuff on mental health and psychology which is not even related to my studies.  I hit the gym and maintain a decent body which is the only reason I could have a little self-worth. I have no great hobbies to look upon since my school days my dad did not join me in any extracurricular activities as he was not ready to pay extra for it. He says paying for the education, giving food itself is a huge favour for me. 

Sorry for this rant. I feel like I don't know what I'm doing with my life. Every external happening is deteriorating my mental health. I am very anxious about my uncertain future.  I don't know what to do please help me out. Is there anyone going through my phase?"

1,"Stoic Viewpoint on Ripping off the Band-aid? In life I am coming across things that make me ponder the question, is it better to hold off on solving potential future problems, or give effort immediately to save future stress?

&amp;#x200B;

For example I have been in a long term relationship (5 years), but it is now emerging that where we want to be in the next 2-10 years does not cleanly intertwine. But the problem is that right now, things aren't bad at all in the relationship and we share values and a good connection where I could see things working out perfectly 15 years down the road and it is very easy to let things coast by. The Seneca quote ""He suffers more than necessary, suffers before it is necessary."" makes me think that maybe I should continue to let things coast on and see if either of our future desires change so that we would benefit from sticking together, and toughing it out in the middle if necessary. Things are fine for now, but while we wait to possibly go our separate ways we would only get more attached, or start more issues. This brings up the (non-stoic but I think still powerful ) quote by psychologist Jordan Peterson ""If you have to fight a dragon, you should go to its lair before it comes to your village."" Right now trying to ignore a potential future issue would save a lot of stress, but dealing with it now could save even more stress in the future.

I guess the TLDR version is for possible future emotional hinderances, do you deal with them at first sign, or let them possibly develop into a bigger problem at the hope they go away?"

1,"The Navy SEAL Creed / Ethos sounds incredibly Stoic! “In times of war or uncertainty there is a special breed of warrior ready to answer our Nation’s call. A common man with uncommon desire to succeed. Forged by adversity, he stands alongside America’s finest special operations forces to serve his country, the American people, and protect their way of life. I am that man.

My Trident is a symbol of honor and heritage. Bestowed upon me by the heroes that have gone before, it embodies the trust of those I have sworn to protect. By wearing the Trident I accept the responsibility of my chosen profession and way of life. It is a privilege that I must earn every day.

My loyalty to Country and Team is beyond reproach. I humbly serve as a guardian to my fellow Americans always ready to defend those who are unable to defend themselves. I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions. I voluntarily accept the inherent hazards of my profession, placing the welfare and security of others before my own.

I serve with honor on and off the battlefield. The ability to control my emotions and my actions, regardless of circumstance, sets me apart from other men. Uncompromising integrity is my standard. My character and honor are steadfast. My word is my bond.

We expect to lead and be led. In the absence of orders I will take charge, lead my teammates and accomplish the mission. I lead by example in all situations.

I will never quit. I persevere and thrive on adversity. My Nation expects me to be physically harder and mentally stronger than my enemies. If knocked down, I will get back up, every time. I will draw on every remaining ounce of strength to protect my teammates and to accomplish our mission. I am never out of the fight.

We demand discipline. We expect innovation. The lives of my teammates and the success of our mission depend on me – my technical skill, tactical proficiency, and attention to detail. My training is never complete.

We train for war and fight to win. I stand ready to bring the full spectrum of combat power to bear in order to achieve my mission and the goals established by my country. The execution of my duties will be swift and violent when required yet guided by the very principles that I serve to defend.

Brave men have fought and died building the proud tradition and feared reputation that I am bound to uphold. In the worst of conditions, the legacy of my teammates steadies my resolve and silently guides my every deed. I will not fail.”"

""Consider when, on a voyage, your ship is anchored; if you go on shore to get water you may along the way amuse yourself with picking up a shellfish, or an onion. However, your thoughts and continual attention ought to be bent towards the ship, waiting for the captain to call on board; you must then immediately leave all these things, otherwise you will be thrown into the ship, bound neck and feet like a sheep. So it is with life. If, instead of an onion or a shellfish, you are given a wife or child, that is fine. But if the captain calls, you must run to the ship, leaving them, and regarding none of them. But if you are old, never go far from the ship: lest, when you are called, you should be unable to come in time.""

&gt;Men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the country, sea-shores, and mountains; and thou too art wont to desire such things very much. But this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men, for it is in thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself. For nowhere either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble does a man retire than into his own soul, particularly when he has within him such thoughts that by looking into them he is immediately in perfect tranquility; and I affirm that tranquility is nothing else than the good ordering of the mind. Constantly then give to thyself this retreat, and renew thyself; and let thy principles be brief and fundamental, which, as soon as thou shalt recur to them, will be sufficient to cleanse the soul completely, and to send thee back free from all discontent with the things to which thou returnest. For with what art thou discontented? With the badness of men? Recall to thy mind this conclusion, that rational animals exist for one another, and that to endure is a part of justice, and that men do wrong involuntarily; and consider how many already, after mutual enmity, suspicion, hatred, and fighting, have been stretched dead, reduced to ashes; and be quiet at last.- But perhaps thou art dissatisfied with that which is assigned to thee out of the universe.- Recall to thy recollection this alternative; either there is providence or atoms, fortuitous concurrence of things; or remember the arguments by which it has been proved that the world is a kind of political community, and be quiet at last.- But perhaps corporeal things will still fasten upon thee.- Consider then further that the mind mingles not with the breath, whether moving gently or violently, when it has once drawn itself apart and discovered its own power, and think also of all that thou hast heard and assented to about pain and pleasure, and be quiet at last.- But perhaps the desire of the thing called fame will torment thee.- See how soon everything is forgotten, and look at the chaos of infinite time on each side of the present, and the emptiness of applause, and the changeableness and want of judgement in those who pretend to give praise, and the narrowness of the space within which it is circumscribed, and be quiet at last. For the whole earth is a point, and how small a nook in it is this thy dwelling, and how few are there in it, and what kind of people are they who will praise thee

I have the Gregory Hays edition, but this translation seems much more elegant. I feel like the Gregory Hayes edition is great for anybody just starting to read philosophy and was the book that got me into it, but I'd like to study an edition that ""spoon-feeds"" me a little less, for lack of a better term.

For example you hire someone and they make a whole bunch of commitments (you believe them)  and then totally flake or are incapable.  What is the proper mindset when they make representations about what they are going to do?  Seems like a lot of mental baggage to both believe them and not believe them?

1,"The Power of The Mind Hello there. Although I've been practicing stoicism for awhile now, I just joined r/Stoicism today. While thinking about the first post to make, and running my ideas across all sorts of different topics that might be relevant, whether about love, life, loss, loneliness, disappointments, or other ordinary struggles, I noticed that my mind, with the applied stoic values of self-examination and acceptance accompanied by the rigorous application of logical thinking and understanding about what one can and cannot control, could not bring up any trouble worthy of writing about. That is, I found myself automatically put at ease through recognizing how much power I have over my own response to life events. For this reason, I have decided to make my first post here a reiteration of this: Although it might be tempting to let ourselves be carried away by our suffering, we, as thinking, rational individuals, have the capacity to determine our response to our suffering, and our thoughts and actions are the only things we should really strive to control; all else is outside of our genuine reach and is of little concern to us. If you can do that, the power which rests within your mind may bring you to the same state of peace that I'm currently in, or at least that is my hope.

But that's not why I'm here. I'm here because I hope for some Stoic advice on not how to parent my friend. Let me explain.  


My friend has recently taken up smoking. I really don't like that. They have asthma and taking up the habit in general, in my opinion, is a poor choice. The problem is, I get upset. Unreasonably upset. I have actually gotten into arguments with them on the subject, which upset the both of us. I just get so...heated, as if the act of smoking is some grave sin which I know it isn't. I know it's not the mark of a bad person either, this person is one of my best friends and I would gladly do whatever I could for them.  


I try to justify it by saying it comes from a place of caring, but it doesn't make it less annoying to them, and it's become more of something I say to myself rather than any actual justification. I don't want to lose their friendship, and I also don't want to make it worse either.

I don’t know. Is prayer a Stoic’s concern since there is no way to know if it controls outcomes?

It’s granted that prayer may have a calming or meditative effect. I understand its value here as a tool to control mental state. On the other hand, asking for things in prayer relegates control to an external force. How is this idea useful to Stoics since they are not concerned with things outside their control?

1,"How did you fing stoicism? This is a genuine question, we are over 300 thousands people on this subreddit and I'm curious how did you find stoicism. First let me tell my story.

It was about two years ago, when a girl rejected me. I felt awful. She didn't care about me afterwards at all. For weeks, I was just worrying about the whole situation, on how I messed up, etc. After a few weeks, I decided to just simply not care. I mean, if she didn't care about me, why would I? And thus, I started not caring about things I couldn't influence. I kind of ""created stoicism in myself"". Even though she rejected me, after me realizing I shouldn't care, it was my best few months in my life. I was so happy, relaxed and I could focus on myself and other important things more then before. I realized how I wasted my time ""chasing"" her, and how much better I could've spent it.

This is due to convergent evolution, it means that species (or people) in the same environment develop the same traits. I believe this is how most people became stoic, they decided not to care about something.

However, at this point, I still didn't know about stoicism as a philosophy. But one day I was scrolling through youtube, when I saw a video thumbnail: ""the philosophy of not caring"", and the title was something about stoicism. I did not watch the video right away, but I searched stoicism in Google to read a bit about it. And I instantly became obsessed with the philosophy.

Recently I also decided to read M.A.'s Meditations, and after that, maybe some other stoic books as well.

Looms but the horror of the shade,

1,"How do I know what I can control? I've seen that the dichotomy of what you can and can't control is very important in Stoicism, but I'm having a hard time telling the difference between what I can and can't control. For example, let's say I think I might have a brain tumor. I can't whether or not I get a brain tumor, so Stoicism might lead me to simply avoid thinking about that possibility. However, if I were to in fact have a brain tumor, it would be in my control to go to the doctor and see what they could do about it, which leads me to think that worrying about having a tumor could be a good thing. So what should one do in this circumstance as a Stoic? Should they refuse to worry, because it's out of their control, or should they worry, because there is a chance that it is in their control?"

1,"It is infinitely easier to just learn to accept reality as it is, than try to change reality itself. To quote Alan Watts when asked what reality was: ""Reality is.""

Reality doesn't change. It won't change. It can't change, because if it does change then that becomes reality instead. Within the broad expanse of reality lies all of our externals, our indifferents; the factors of life we have no control over. It is what we must learn to accept, instead of try to change.

Consider the last time you really worried or stressed about something, be it in the past, present, or future. Consider all the energy and emotion that went into trying to change it. Did you see any fruit for your efforts? If you did, good, we'll talk about that a little later. More often than not, however, you will see your efforts and emotional energy worrying or stressing about something you do not control go to waste, or at least most of it. Now think about how much more calm, composed, and dare I say happy had you foregone the struggle and loved the fate you were given. Think about what good that energy could've done had it been directed into something you *do* control, like your attitude, or your choice.

This is not to say that we do not try to effect our surroundings, or that we are powerless to change anything so, why bother? This is not Stoicism, that's fatalism. Study your hardest for that test, work your ass off for that promotion, spend hours a day exercising to achieve that body you want, these are all applaudable, so long as you understand the previous paragraph. Nothing in the future is guaranteed. To paraphrase one of my favorite passages of Enchiridion, 29, ""In the pursuit of an Olympic gold medal in athletics you may give yourself over completely to your trainer, eating and sleeping only what and when he tells you to, you must submit to rules, abstain from luxuries, and ignore your friends. And, after having done all this, the day before the event you may fall into a ditch, dislocate your arm, turn your ankle or otherwise lose the victory."" Was all that effort still worth it? **Only you can decide that for yourself.**

Once we accept that we do not control reality and learn to just roll with it, life becomes infinitely easier. Because I've accepted that I may never get that promotion, I work even harder at my job because the stress of ""Am I doing everything right?"" is gone. Because I've accepted that my loved ones may be gone tomorrow, I can maximize my time with them today, and spend it better. Because I've accepted that I may never have that ripped athletic body I want, I am happier with progress I have actually made. 

Cheers.

tl;dr: Your drive, your ambitions, your efforts, these are all in your control. But do not assume that you can use them to change what is not in your control."

1,"how to find a balance between being social and talking only what is necessary Dear Stoic friends, 

I have been learning and applying stoic principles every single day for about a year now and my life has improved dramatically ever since. However, one of the teachings I seem to fail the most is:

*“Let silence be your goal for the most part; say only what is necessary, and be brief about it. On the rare occasions when you’re called upon to speak, then speak, but never about banalities like gladiators, horses, sports, food, and drink—common-place stuff...”* **– Epictetus**

I consider myself an extrovert and sometimes I feel the need to fill the silence gaps with things that really don't matter a lot for the most part. 

I wanted to find a way where the conversation wouldn't end, especially when talking to someone that I have just met but at the same time, I don't need to say things about myself - because every time I have nothing to say I end up talking about myself too much and it honestly bothers me when I do so, it is unnecessary and egocentric and no one cares about my life, accomplishments or goals if they did not ask so."

But even when I visualize death of myself or someone else it doesn't really register, I still live life as normal, nothing changed. I don't fully realize death, It doesn't register in my unconscious.

How do I fully realize I and many others close to me are going to die?"

1,"Should I go cold turkey on entertainment to prove myself that I am not addicted to them? Just started to apply Stoicism In my life and it kind of seems like I am addicted to entertainment like movies, anime, tv shows, and video games. So should I just stop doing those stuff for some time or is it fine if I just reduce the time I spend on them?

And if I were to stop, how long should I be not consuming them? Is a week too less?"

1,"Anxiety I have trouble rationalising with my anxiety. 

I drove for the first time yesterday around my area, was quite nervous but did fine and once I was going I calmed down and felt better. I also drove today this time I went to the shopping centre. I was nervous about parking and managing in confined spaces, which I ended up doing fine. Once I got going I felt better but I was still a little nervous. But beforehand I was really nervous and picturing myself making errors like hitting a gutter something. I ended up accidentally running over m the gutter a little and my boot flung open. I had to quickly find somewhere to pull over and fix it. Luckily, there were no damages done to my car. I felt a little embarrassed before remaining myself, “I cannot control the opinions others may have, and if people can bother they will soon forget. The situation is over and I can move on now.” 

So, before i left my thoughts said, “What if something goes wrong? What if I hit somebody or something.” I tried to reply, “I’ve driven a long time and I always do fine. I’m just underestimating myself. These images are only impressions and in fact reality.” However, it turns it I did make an error by running over the gutter a bit as I was exiting the shopping centre which I did not see. 

Next time, how could I have handled my anxiety better?"
