vikings,"opinion  vikings must go qb in draft understand we have glaring needs all over the defense and offensive lines, but skipping out on quarterback in this good of qb draft doesn seem smart  we really need to be aggressive and trade up for one of these players, similarly to what kc did to grab mahomes few years back  yes, kirk is not the main problem with our roster but his limited skillset cripples our chances of contending for super bowl, especially when you consider his contract 

the time is now for the vikings organization to stop trying to retool roster in hopes of making the playoffs, when 4 rare quarterback talents await in the upcoming draft "

anyways, not like it matters, but 7 years down the road we still have cook and he just passed marshall faulk on the all time leader board  we still have jefferson and he just passed 8,000 yards  we still have ham busting holes for cook  and the last player left is danielle hunter still sacking some bitches with his huge arms     
  
few side notes, fotf is way different than years past  you can play every game and the game forces you to not win the superbowl every year  they give you random injuries you have to play through or get benched through and miss season, etc etc  they ask you who you want on your team and who you think does more for the team  the game will make the trades and you will lose player and gain player  for example, it asked me who thought did more for the team, harry the hitman or thielen play offence so of course said thielen  very next game harry was released and we picked up someone  can remember  the first year won the superbowl was asked who wanted for my dream team for trades and was offered john ross and austin hooper was legit throwing to thielen, jefferson, ross, ruddy, and hooper  running with cook

vikings,"1st half scoring is the most damning statistic when it comes to this team offensive philosophy vikings ranking in 1st half scoring  25th
vikings ranking in 2nd half scoring  1st


we all know that we have fantastic weapons at rb and wr and qb who can make the throws  what this stat shows me is we are playing two different types of football in each half and it clearly is hampering our success  


as fan of this team, and zimmer, think our stubbornness in cutting it loose earlier in the game is what is stopping this team from being elite on offense (i know we have enough issues in 2020 with the so won say it would ve been enough to make run)  we are all aware that zimmer demands we run the ball early and often, but don think that philosophy is what is best for the teams success and even though like zimmer as coach he has to abandon this thought process if we want to be legitimate contenders next year 

since we are 25th in 1st half scoring, that means there are 7 teams ranked behind us  those 7 are all in the bottom 8 of total scoring, with the other team being the bengals  meanwhile, despite the 1st half ineffectiveness in scoring, the vikings are 13th in overall scoring  what this tells me is that those other teams are just bad in general at scoring, whereas we are actually above average at scoring, but we refuse to show it until we absolutely have to 


in summary, think this team has the weapons to go far, but the team unwillingness to let it loose earlier in games ultimately holds this team back "

this had been based on individual rankings, and that been great, but thought it be fun to add team aspect   last week we did the  reddit vs radio challenge ( where we had 2 members from detroit sports radio ( the dtm squatch ( and  jeffriger ( compete against 2 redditors who are part of fantasyfootball   we put  100 for the winning team (so  50 per teammate), and  team reddit ended up winning (

wanted to give them another shot, but instead of facing one team of 2, wanted to add bit more competition, and do an nfc north challenge for week 17 (4 teams of 2)   

since they re on the radio from the detroit area, dan and jeff are going to represent team detroit lions   now we re looking for volunteers to make up teams for the rest of the nfc north  

for this last week,   we re giving out  300 to the person who has the most accurate rankings across all positions, then another  100 for this nfc north challenge ( 50 per teammate)     if you like to volunteer as one of the 2 members to represent team minnesota vikings, let me know  "

since 2019, he only missed 3 games due to injury, so here hoping that he can keep staying healthy, and keep balling in 2021!"
vikings,"so    trey lance most people looking at trey lance see him huge boom bust pick in the upcoming draft see him being mocked to bears and panthers know he doesn have many starts but his athleticism, arm strength, mobility, and poise are worth at least workout don 100  buy into the small school thing either, shouldn have to list out all the big school qbs that fail in the nfl 

the vikings are probably going to have the ability to get lance, even if it meant trading up spot or two  while would love to see qb prospect finally drafted seven years after bridgewater, rick speilman doesn have the balls to do it  avoiding rookie qb is best for his job since we have the reliable 9 7 cousins under center  and honestly, if there any chance lance could have lengthy career in the nfl, he not going to be able to do it with head coach that despises quarterbacks  if it were all up to zimmer, we would probably still have complete bum at qb like bridgewater and have jake browning for backup

trey hendrickson looks like an interesting option in fa  12 5 sacks so far and 24 tackles for loss  we don have the cash to splurge on the high end defenders that are ufas this year like von, judon, williamson but we will most likely loose barr, stephen to clear space and due to performance  any other names you can think of that would make great addition? any player that can soak pressure for hunter to attack the passing game is what we need "
vikings,"big picture   what is your preferred route forward for the roster front office moving to 2021 and beyond? am struggling mightily with my offseason armchair gm outlook can construct roster for 2021 that looks playoff caliber, but it comes at the cost of pushing salaries down the road and effectively re committing significant cap hits to players that are merely decent pieces   this might be ok in normal situation, but think many fans are overlooking the massive salary hikes that are coming in 2022 (kirk   14m, cook   6 8m, pierce   5m, neill extension)   so, even if we get good cap bump we are going to be looking at situation in the next offseason that looks lot like this one, with scramble to get under the cap and no room to compete in fa   then we are two years down the road and unless we knock the ball out of the park with drafts, sitting with good but not great roster and aging core players (adam, harry) 

so, do we play that out?  or do we do soft or hard reset? soft reboot would be acknowledgement that 2021 will be another down year, but we get the cap in hand by letting expensive pieces walk   perhaps put the team in position to draft qb high in the 2022 draft   or hard reboot including starting over at qb and the front office

vikings,"thoughts on kubiak offense in 2020? things to improve in 2021? long gone are the days where the vikings seemingly only needed to score 21 points to win every game, but feel like the 2020 offense exceeded expectations and provides lot of reasons to be excited going into 2021 

heading into next season, on offense we have 
1  the best rb in the nfl
2 deadly wr duo consisting of an elite red zone threat in thielen and the best young wr in the nfl in jefferson
3  the best qb play in the zimmer era since case ""big balls"" keenum
4  continuity on offense assuming that kubiak retains his role as oc

it easy to nitpick when we lost as many games as we did in 2020, but the offense seemed to be pretty solid down the stretch, barring some horrendous calls on 3rd 4th and short  more scheme wise and less personnel wise, what did you like this season and what would like to see differently next season? personally, would love to see more downfield passing earlier in the game  dalvin is dalvin, but it seems like every time we took downfield shots to jeff, good things happened  also seeing diggs get double digit targets each game in buffalo with how the bills offense is performing really makes me not want to see another great wr get underutilized in minnesota "

vikings,"what makes you think the vikings will be legit contenders next year ? as far as can tell the vikings have gaping holes at   dt, 3t, edge rusher  2, lg, c, and rg 

cb 1 and cb 2 are tbd as to whether they will be good next year  

safety are good, but perhaps regressing ?

kendricks is elite, barr is above average but doesn move the needle much 

wrs and rbs are elite  

qb is good  great with protection but very vulnerable without it  

offense was top 10 this year and defense was bottom 10  generally legit contenders are top 5 on one side of the ball and top 10 15 on the other  

so to be contender vikes either jump to top 5 offense and the defense improves to above average or the defense makes massive jump to be top 5 and elite 


can anyone see joe either of these scenarios come to fruition? offense won ever be elite and top 5 unless they get good ol, and it nigh impossible to replace 3 players on your ol with solidly good guys during an offseason  the defense has wayyyyy too many holes to shore up like 5 positions in one off season to take the jump to being top 5 m seeing top 10 offensive year with better defense but not significant better defense  meaning probably an 8th best offense plus somewhere in the 14 17th best defense which puts them at around 7 10 wins like most years under zimmer  am missing something ? can someone talk me out of this ?"
vikings,"do you think diggs is in better situation now ? bills look legit  obviously he in better situation this year as allen has been much better than kirk and they re 12 3, but do you think that will be true for the next 3 4 years compared to the vikings ?"
vikings,"don assume that all young players will get better next year and all good players will maintain their level and not regress every fan base does it every year and it always bites them in the ass  they always think all the bad things will get better and all the good things will stay the same  

just look at all the prediction threads for last year, everyone had the secondary improving after losing 3 corners and replacing them with younger guys and look how that panned out  

it fine to be optimistic, but assuming most young players are going to take step next year is naive  it no guarantee that dantzler and gladney become much better next year, that what fans hope for but it isn realistic  realistically less than half the young players actually take step up, that should be the expectation wouldn count on gladney being serviceable corner next year  dantzler ? sure, think he showed enough  


another big one is bradbury at c, he has been pretty bad in pass protection now for his 2nd year going see lot of  well the guards are bad so it hard to judge  but again the tape is the tape and he just doesn look good at all in pass protection  don expect miraculous 3rd year jump into being good pass protector or decent pass protecting ol 


the way see it is the vikes still have lot of holes to be filled  dt (people heavily overrate pierce here), c, lg, rg, edge rusher  2 after daniele are definitely needs  cb1, cb2 , and safety still might be bad holes next year that lead to another bottom 10 defense  they are very good at ilb, wr 1 and 2, qb and rb  


the game is still won in the trenches  bringing back hunter will undoubtedly make the dline better but it a far cry from making them really good  does pierce move the needle that much ? that answer is still tbd, don assume it takes them back to top 10 defense like see everyone saying 


expectations need to be tempered, next year could very will likely be another 6 9 win season with missing the playoffs  don get too drunk on the kool aid or you get what happened this year "

vikings,"unpopular opinion  we don need to work on defense ve been talking to family and friends about what moves the vikings need to make for next season  all hear is  we need new cbs   we need an all new defense   our defense is terrible   let me lead with, your defense is not the best right now, can deny that, but we are also missing some key players to our defense (barr, kendrick, hunter, etc)  we need an line m not the biggest fan of cousins but he can even play when the line can stop any pressure have whole argument for needing o line before new quarterback but will save you the time  drafting new cbs to an already new secondary isn going to help any, we need to let the guys we have mature into the position  it like adding gasoline to an already burning building "
vikings,"jefferson could be in store for historic day vs  the lions pass looking at how bad the lions pass is and what it could mean for jefferson chasing rookie receiving records (in depth look) with one game remaining and the vikings eliminated from playoff contention, there is nothing to look forward to other than better draft pick and personal accolades milestones for the players    

the statistical milestones that are up for grabs for cousins cook thielen jefferson can be found here    
  
    

at the top of that list has to be jefferson and the rookie receiving yards record  this is going to be really in depth post, but he has rare opportunity in terms of team circumstance and opponent to have career day, and legitimately challenge the rookie receiving yards record    

  jefferson current place in history for rookie receivers     

going into week 17, jefferson has no shot at challenging the rookie receptions record (2003 anquan boldin with 101 catches, jefferson is at 79), or rookie td record (1998 randy moss with 17 td, jefferson with 7)  in rookie receiving yards, however, he currently ranks 5th all time

  team situation   nothing to play for     

the vikings officially cannot make the playoffs  since mike zimmer took over in 2014, the vikings have played total of 3 meaningless games    

week 16 in 2014 37 35 to dolphins (7 7)      
week 17 in 2014 13 9 vs  bears (3 12)   
week 17 in 2016 38 10 vs  bears (3 12)   

2016 week 17

  3,627 yards, 17 td coming into week 17

  peterson injured for most of season   
  mckinnon had 143 450 1, asiata had 113 388 6 coming in   
  mckinnon had 16 89 1   3 21 1, asiata had 8 14 0, 3 31 0     

wr diggs, wr thielen, te rudolph   
  diggs injured for week 17   
  thielen had 68 (91 targets) 960 5, rudolph had 72 (117 targets) 723 6   
  thielen had 1 (1) 7 0, rudolph had 11 (15) 117 1   
  major disparity considering the milestone, but bears had great corners with no diggs to draw attention away and bradford loved rudolph as security blanket    

zimmer never rested skill position players in the 2014 games  old greg jennings played all 16  peterson was injured that entire year    

the above tells me that even though it was meaningless game, he gave his starters ample opportunity and didn pull them in blowout  the thielen thing is interesting though, he only needed 40 yards for 1,000, ran the most routes on the team, and was targeted once vs  rudolph 15    

when game doesn matter and you re just letting your starters pile up stats, it leads me to believe he may do this again    

  detroit lions historically poor coverage     

the lions are the worst coverage team in the nfl  not only this, but they re one of the worst coverage teams in nfl history    

in terms of advanced analytics, pff has them at 29 4 coverage grade  the next worse this year is the jaguars at 33 1  the median is 61 9 and the best is washington at 84 3    

the only teams with worse grade since pff started recording stats in 2006 are    

2014 washington  28 6   
2010 texans  28 7   
2010 jaguars  29 3   

in terms of more simple receiving stats, the lions have allowed the 10th most yards per passing attempt since 1970, along with the 2nd highest passer rating of all time (since 1940)

det   2020   355 517   4175   8 075   35 7   111 3   

the numbers also weight heavily towards receivers  these are the 6 teams that have allow more than 9 yards per target to wrs    

team   completions allowed   targets   yards allowed   yards target

cowboys   190   290   2621   9 04
jaguars   205   297   2676   9 01   

15 teams in the league allow fewer than 8 yards per target to wrs    

every metric points towards the lions being not only the worst pass defense in the league, but one of the worst ever, and one of the worst at defending against wrs    

  looking at lions performance vs  top 2 wrs each game     

assuming jefferson and thielen are good to go in week 17, they ll form their usual 2 headed monster that demands attention thought it would be worthwhile to look at how each receiver has done in each game    

yards per route run simply calculates the number of yards divided by the number of routes player has run  for reference, among the top 100 most targeted receivers, these are the top 5 this season    

1  davante adams   3 01 rr   
2  corey davis   2 67 rr   
3  julio jones   2 60 rr

these are the two wr in the middle

so, in other words, the aggregate  1 wr that faced the lions this year would be the  8 wr in the league by yards per route run, just behind  7 stefon diggs  the aggregate  2 wr that the lions faced this year would be the  5 wr in the league by yards per route run, just behind jefferson and just ahead of ridley  the average of the top 2 wr would be the  6 wr in the league, behind calvin ridley, but ahead of j  brown    

  how the lions deficiencies benefit jefferson game     

it simple to say that team has bad pass d, but it important to look at how those yards are being accumulated  if could describe the lions pass as simple as possible, it that they are very prone to giving up huge plays  they aren ""bend don break"" at all, they have massive lapses consistently  this is something that benefits jefferson game as receiver that makes his living in intermediate and deep game

the interesting thing about this is that the lions have allowed 24 total and 18 from wr in just the last 5 games, the exact point when they changed coaches and shifted from okudah and trufant as their primary corners due to injury to their current set up, which will get into below  also remember that the lions don have as many pass attempts against compared to most teams, but they re still right up there in volume due to their inefficiency       

the qb statistics in their last 5 games are  121 161 (75 2 ), 1,591 yards (9 88 yards attempt), 17 td 0 int, 141 08 passer rating   

  lions personnel     

the lions corners have been mess this year  darius slay left for philly so they signed   desmond trufant   from atlanta  he been dealing with injuries all year and is on the injured reserve    
  
  jeff okudah   was the 3rd overall pick, who they threw right into the fire much like we did with gladney and dantzler  he lost playing time and is also on the injured reserve  he graded out as the worst corner in the league in numerous metrics  trufant wasn far ahead of him when he was playing    

  justin coleman   was injured in week 1, but returned to his usual role in the slot after has been constant in the slot all year  last season he was statistically one of the worst corners in the league  he was targeted 2nd most and gave up the 4th most yards    

with the multiple injuries to corners occurring in week 1, amani orwariye was thrust into starting role right off the bat, and has been relied on as an outside corner every week  he was 5th round pick in 2019, being used sparingly in his rookie year towards the end of the year  with all the injuries to corners this year, he literally played double the coverage snaps over the next highest corner    

darryl roberts was their  5 cb coming into the year  they signed him to 1 year deal after he struggled last year and lost his job on the jets  he filled in in the slot when coleman   trufant went down but has been used exclusively as an outside corner since the more recent injuries to trufant okudah    

they ve used couple different practice squad guys, but most recently tramaine brock just as healthy body  he saw some playing time against the bucs with roberts struggling      

here are the stats for all the players in the secondary, with jefferson added in for reference

  corner utilization for the lions     

all you need to know is that since the coaching change the lions corner use has been the same every game  oruwariye will log slot snaps when no one is one his side, but he lines up at lcb 100  of the time    

roberts on the other hand is the opposite  he will trail into the slot less than oruwariye, but in terms of his outside snaps, he lines up on the right side 100  of the time  in the slot, coleman almost exclusively plays thee     

they have been really simplifying playing lot of man coverage since the coaching change  they were criticized heavily for playing too much man coverage before under patricia    

   

of course with an interim coach there only so much you can do to implement new strategies, and patricia has been so heavy on man coverage over the years that it easier to just play the season out and worry about big scale changes with new coach next year    

man coverage should bode well for jefferson, who has among the best in the league at beating single coverage  lions also bring their safety up in the box more than most, leaving single high safety to defend, which will be good for jefferson with thielen drawing attention    

this is rare match up where wouldn worry at all about the match up  you could argue that matching up more vs  oruwariye would be better due to his propensity to give up the big play  but with roberts  shakiness on the other side and coleman giving up so much consistent production on the inside, there really no bad option here  vikings love using jefferson on both sides and in the slot lot, so see no use changing anything up        

for whatever it worth, patricia and the lions identified thielen as the vikings  1 in their first match up, choosing to use trufant as their shadow (trufant on thielen and mclaurin are the lions only two shadows of the year)  that being said, this is irrelevant for this game, lions usage has been completely stagnant    

  big plays against members of the lions secondary      

as mentioned before, the big thing in this match up is big plays  here are all the 20  yard gains that oruwariye roberts coleman harmon walker also added the one from brock in as he saw spot duty against the bucs    

oruwariye (lions  1 outside corner)    

   

roberts (lions  2 outside corner)    

   

coleman (lions slot corner)    

   

brock (lions depth corner)    

   

harmon walker (lions safeties)    

   

  bottom line     

while the season is over, think this is something to look forward to  you only get one shot at putting up rookie numbers, and it something that will be etched in history for whatever he finishes with think this is just flat out rare circumstance that could lead to huge boom game    

  vikings eliminated from playoffs, game script won be as important   
  passing defense opponent who ranks among the worst of all time, not just this season    
  lions coaching change midseason and lack of personnel among corners has led to them simplifying everything where you know exactly what to expect   

if you want to swing for the fence, there have been 12 yardage totals by rookies that if jefferson joined that group, it would put him into the  1 spot

vikings,bring back 96 questions 
vikings,"what do the vikings need to do fix the offensive line    and can they? off the top of my head think the line struggles go back to at least 2015 

we ve signed free agents and drafted linemen and nothing seems to work think if you asked vikings fans who they should draft in the 1st round in the upcoming draft many would say offensive lineman 

is it that the team is not good at evaluating line talent or is it coaching issue? 

mike remmers appears to be playing well (0 sacks allowed per pff) and pat elflien is playing for the jets    maybe he not great but believe he starting for them and yet we cut him because we have so much other talent on the line   ? m sure there are other linemen we ve kicked to the curb who have at least become serviceable for other teams 

how can we acquire lineman after lineman and not only are they not serviceable but the vast majority are so bad they barely last more than couple of years on the roster ?"

vikings,"using what you know about our draft position, free agency, returning players, and potential trades  how would you construct our defensive and offensive lines next season? this obviously operates on the premise that the lines need some help "
vikings,"would you pick up dwayne haskins? with dwayne being cut don know how coveted he is, but mechanically gifted qb that has good upside for cheap that could sit behind very accurate good decision making qb (when he isn fumbling) doesn seem like the worst insurance if we don wanna target qb in the draft  what do you guys think?"
vikings,new qb on the market  nothing like kirk so we should pick him up right? 
vikings, ian rapoport  lions fs kearse released 
vikings,"my detailed off season plan for the 2021 vikings (clearing cap space and free agency) so obviously this season has not been great, but we have lot to be excited about for next year  if, next year, the offense can play like they have this year, and our comes back healthy and in it usual top 10 form, we will be very serious playoff contender  that being said, the off season is going to be extremely important in making both of these things happen  here are my thoughts in regards to what we should cap wise, in free agency and in the draft, while trying to be as realistic as possible 

  clearing up cap space in 2021

so the first thing we ll need to take care of is the cap  in 2021, each nfl team will likely only have  176mm to operate with, which is massive  22mm smaller than this year  that puts us at    12,887,671 over the cap  , assuming we don resign anyone (we ll get to that later)  not great, but at least we re not  97mm over the cap like certain scummy team  now, we will have    4,378,133 rolled over into 2021  , which brings us to    8,499,538 over the cap  

there are few key pieces that think we need to add retain, so in order to move forward with those, let look at how we can clear some of the cap in 2021, let look at the most probable cut candidate 

 amp  x200b 

 player cap savings cut don cut 
          
 riley reiff  11,750,000 don cut 
 anthony barr  7,262,500 cut 
 kyle rudolph  5,100,000 cut 
 shamar stephen  3,750,000 cut 
 dan bailey  1,700,000 cut 
 jalyn holmes  920,000 cut 

 amp  x200b 

  reiff very popular opinion within our fanbase is that reiff should be cut next year strongly disagree  despite our perpetual line issues, reiff has been incredibly solid, wrote post ( about him while ago do believe that bringing in solid guard will be key to solving most of our line issue (despite bradburry and cleveland struggles) but that is assuming that reiff is still there to anchor the line at lt  remove him from that spot and we have even more holes to fix do believe that he will be extended in way that will help us clear some cap this year potentially 

  anthony barr    another polarizing one  him and kendricks have been solid duo for while now, but unfortunately, barr has never really justified his massive contract do think that kendricks is very similar to harrison smith, in that he makes guys playing next to him better  that would explain the emergence of wilson  so unfortunately, think barr time as mn viking has come to an end 

  kyle rudolph    another heartbreaker  rudolph is getting older and less durable  meanwhile irv and conklin have shown that his absence was not really missed  he the heart of this team, but unfortunately this is still business and think we should let him go  do think they will? no, think they will restructure  but for the sake of this post ll assume he gone 

  shamar stephen and jayln holmes    not much to say about either  they both have been really disappointing and are two easy cut candidates who will free cap space 

  dan bailey    not much else to say here  terrible season, and it should not be excused  we can draft kicker or sign someone else in free agency 

  so, after those cutting barr, rudolph, stephen, holmes and bailey, we save total of   18,732,500, giving us  10,232,962 of cap room   

keep in mind that the team can also restructure bunch of players  over the last few years, they have restructured cousins, hunter, kendricks and saved around  5 7mm in cap space expect our cap room to be around  15mm when all is said and done 

  vikings 2021 in house free agency

so, now that we have cleared some cap room, let look at what we ll want to do with that  first off, who do we want to re sign  below are some key players who will be free agents in 2021 

  anthony harris
  ifeadi odenigbo
  eric wilson
  dakota dozier
  brett jones
  chad beebe
  jaleel johnson
  ameer abdullah

out of all of these guys, believe the only one we should re sign are eric wilson, brett jones, chad beebe and ameer abdullah  

wilson largely depends on the kind of contract he is looking for  kendricks is on 10mm year contract, so don expect wilson to look for anything within that range  anything around  6 7mm year would be fair  the remaining signing would have fairly small impact on our cap, in total maybe  1 5 2mm 

  vikings 2021 external free agency

so this section is going to be pure speculation, because obviously don know what the fo plans are but also because don know what our final cap situation will look like can only guess 

but there are 2 positions would like to bring to the team  3t defensive tackle and veteran cb 

  bringing in defensive tackle  

so, my plan lets go of stephen, odenigbo and holmes  meaning that the only dt we would have are pierce, watts, hercules and lynch  not great, not terrible  but if pierce doesn hold up well, then we re in serious trouble 

the 2021 class is supposed to be on of the worst ones for dt, with not single dt worth drafting in the first round  for that reason, we re better off trying to build via free agency  our cap limits us, but we have some decent options available  

the one am most interested in is   poona ford  , the dt for the seahawks  ford is set to be an rfa in 2021, which may make things complicated  however, am unsure that the seahawks will be able to resign him  they will have about  17mm in cap, but need to re sign kj wright, dunbar, carson, griffin 1  amp  2, and on top of that keep some room to extend jamaal adams who they gave up first for  if they are unable to sign him, bringing ford in would be major hit  poona ford isn a house name, but has been borderline top 15 dt this year  his pff grade of 80 would be the highest defensive grade on our team this season  he is not great pass rusher, but excels in the run game  he has been performing particularly well ever since dunlap and jamaal adams came joined came back, which bodes well for pairing with hunter and pierce  he would likely be around that  6 8mm year range as well, which we would be able to afford 

another option would be to bring vet on one year deal, and hope to draft dt next year damukong suh   is set to be ufa, and highly unlikely to resign with the bucs  in fact can almost guarantee that they won be able to resign him given their fa class  he had signed one year  8mm fully guaranteed deal with them so we would need to cap space to offer something similar believe we will have the space, but not by much, so this is more unlikely 

if all else fails, the last option would be to bring back stephen on one year deal   this is believe is the most likely scenario at dt 

  bringing in veteran cb3 made post ( about this while ago, so won elaborate too much  but we cannot count on mike hughes to be available, and have no depth behind gladney and dantzler (i do not ever want to see chris jones in vikings uniform ) do think we ll draft cb, but we need to bring some stability to our secondary, and think bringing in vet on cheap   one year deal to play as cb3 is going to be paramount

so obviously lot of this is based off my personal thoughts and opinion d be very curious as to what you guys think also spend lot of time scouting so could do similar post about our draft if you guys are interested "

vikings,"breaking down how week 17 can affect the vikings draft outlook   official rooting schedule for best pick     

  patriots over bills or patriots over jets   
  texans over titans    
  chargers over chiefs   
  washington over eagles   
  lions over vikings   
  panthers over saints   
  broncos over raiders   
  cardinals over rams   
  49ers over seahawks   

if all those conditions are met, the vikings will draft 8th overall  if the vikings lose, the patriots games don matter  worst case scenario is drafting 15th    

if you want, you can read below for why this is the case       

  teams vikings are guaranteed to draft ahead of     

first off, there are 17 teams that the vikings cannot finish ahead of in the standings, which means they can pick no lower than 15th  of the teams that can finish as low as 7 wins (best the vikings can finish) that are guaranteed to finish with better strength of schedule (first tiebreaker), you have    

raiders   546 sos   
vikings    500 sos   

you also have the nfc east winner being guaranteed better draft pick for the 17th team    

  teams that the vikings are guaranteed to draft behind     

these are the teams that are guaranteed to finish lower than the vikings, which means having better pick    

jaguars   
jets   
texans (pick traded to mia)      
falcons   
bengals   
eagles   
giants cowboys (loser of week 17)    

 for the cowboys, their  472 strength of schedule would give them higher draft positioning if they were to lose   the vikings were to win and both go 6 10  if the giants lose, they be 5 11     

  overall range of possible draft picks    

so, we know the vikings will pick between 8 15    

  how the lions can get worse pick than the vikings     

right off the bat, we have to tackle the most confusing aspect, which is the vikings vs  lions game  if the vikings win, it easy, lions finish with worse record  if the lions win though, it goes to strength of schedule, which is razor thin    

because the vikings and lions have near identical schedules, it would come down to the record of the two opponents that were not common between the lions and vikings    

who the vikings played, but the lions didn seahawks, texans     

who the lions played, but the vikings didn cardinals, washington   

vikings opponents combined record is 15 15, lions is 14 16  based on the lions getting the higher pick if vikings and lions tie in sos, the only way that the vikings can get worse sos than the lions is if the following happens    

lions defeat vikings   
titans defeat texans   
49ers defeat seahawks   
cardinals defeat rams   
washington defeats eagles   

all 5 of those games have to have that result in order for the lions to get worse pick than the vikings  if that doesn happen, the vikings finish with worse pick and can pick no higher than 9th       

  how the rest of the week 17 results can affect the vikings pick     

  other 6 win teams     

  if the patriots (6 8) win at least 1 of these 2 games, they cannot finish with better pick than the vikings (due to better sos)    

patriots vs  bills   
patriots vs  vikings   

  if the 49ers (6 9) beat the seahawks, the vikings will get better pick than them due to sos    

  the chargers (6 9) have worse sos, so if they win, the vikings have to lose in order to get better pick than them  if the chargers lose to the chiefs, they get better pick than the vikings       

  5 win teams     

so for all these teams, the vikings absolutely have to lose their game to get better draft pick (i ll be talking about the following as if the vikings lost to the lions)    

  lions (5 10)  see above, multiple other conditions have to be met for the vikings to get better draft pick    

  broncos (5 10)  if they beat the raiders, they will finish with worse pick than minnesota due to sos ( 564)   

  panthers (5 10)  if they beat the saints, they will get worse pick than the vikings due to sos ( 530)"

vikings, justin jefferson ain see you do nun but run yo mouth all night       females that play football 
vikings,people blaming the defense without multiple starters are the same people who tell us not to  overreact  whenever cousins has bad game just saying
vikings,"some of my thoughts    whenever watching game, always tend to lurk on subreddits of the two teams playing  one thing noticed during every game is that each teams subreddit tends to judge the majority because of the minority  this was even more prevalent during last night game  there were lots of posts and comments that we re pretty vulgar and just plain wrong on both the saints and vikings subreddits, but both subreddits like to call each fanbase the worst and most toxic in the nfl  but know that the vikings fanbase isn toxic, we point fun at ourselves all the time, and that the same with the saints fanbase  this happens with just about every game that has tension to it  in conclusion just wanted to say that let try not to judge an entire fanbase because of some toxic comments and posts you see  and if you are thinking of making bad and offensive comments, just shut the fuck up love you all and look forward to the vikings future"
vikings,"don commit suicide (personal gameday post  fri dec 25th) first of all, want to thank you, the players, for the mental implication that you ve shown in the game, it meant lot to see you being objectively immerse into the chaotic and painful situation that the team is currently suffering 

it is the best christmas present that you could have ever gave us, for reason, there wasn a single glimpse of mental evasion during the game, you cheered yes, but only when you managed to score or to force turnover, other than that you were doing your job with the utmost dignity 

not that you weren doing it before, but the environment was one of incredible competitiveness, and that was what was radically different in you 

that gold 

the times in which you were able to keep the saints  pace were somewhat good, but from the moment they took off, you took it like champions, it was great, and mean it, not because of our shared misfortune but because only under this kind of mental state is that anyone can trace clear starting point to climb back up 

those turnovers provoked by the secondary were achieved under this heavy mood, there were not pats in the back, there were almost no laughs, there were no emotional escape valves, there was just work, done and to do 

the joy of life, well, that something each of us have on our own, our kids, our parents, our grandmas and papas, our friends, and the little achievements each day must imply to improve ourselves and others 

there is indeed plenty to be thankful and joyful of, but for 3 hours, each now and then, you all are no longer co workers, group of friends or acquaintances, you are into group that goes beyond being family, all of you including the analysts and coaches are single mind, single body with lots of legs and arms and you have single purpose, transcend 

and you demonstrated that despite losing the game, you ve won something even better, focus 

what the fuck are you talking about? many of us wouldn be the next year   

   well that true, regardless of that, remember these words wherever you are, whatever you re doing, the focus is priceless, it gives purpose and the purpose unlike the stochastic and overrated success is not volatile, at all

having said that, it obvious that the defensive problem is not the secondary, the linemen are very tired, they lack of weight, height and power to clinch to the line of scrimmage, the reason why the secondary seems to be that fallible is that they tend to use random element to act like safety, because most of the time our safeties are burnt, and many times the secondary is just overwhelmed with tasks that go far beyond covering by zone or 1 to 1, which are the main educational background areas they have on the field 

that really difficult when it happens to an experienced element, just imagine if some of them are rookies  the weight of that responsibility is just overwhelming 

many times they have to do 2 of those 3 roles at once, and naturally they fail in the third, that just probability defeating them over and over again

the offensive problem is located at the same area, the linemen, you can ""feed"" cook as much as you want, but if the guards can open the opponent line, using run calls becomes highly ineffective 

see how pittsburgh and the very same saints have become too predictable, the first with receivers that are having terrible time to cope with, and the latter having first ballot hof qb that just got back from eleven fractured ribs 

on the same note, our only successful attempts to run have been narrowed to sporadic option plays, but out of necessity we now tend to heavily rely on passing game 

 amp  x200b 

the reason behind the title is especially intended to target the gm, that seems to be eager to dismiss lot of players without the proper analysis on the matter, and without considering how the team mentality has evolved just in this game

thank you for this immeasurable effort, the score don represent the real presence of the team on this game, you ve done it very well
