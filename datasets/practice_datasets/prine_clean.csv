prine,"revised poem post with letter hello in there,

as the year drags on, can help but think about the absence created by the loss of john prine  thinking about his life   what you could know of it from his music and as an appreciator of his art can help but shed tear thinking about his first few and very last song(s)  imaging the deep ocean of experiences that spanned between it with all its shifting tides brought on by years of living 

wordsmiths, believe, are few and far between nowadays, not to say that there aren any at all  but have always found comfort from artists of the past   waylon  amp  willie, townes van zandt, tom hall, merle haggard, bruce springsteen, bobbie gentry, etc, etc     the likes of which have shaped the silent rebel have come to be  unwavering and uncompromising in my journey to deeply appreciate and engage my life as one worth living 

among all my heroes dead and alive, those who have caught my ear in moments of depression and reprieve, john was one who spoke to me on an intrinsic and basic wavelength  his words still do, though now tinged with film of sadness from his recent passing 

looking back, and with recent investment in stoic life philosophy, realize now that john music embodies all the good things one wants to practice in life   understanding your capital nature  living with sense of dignity and humor  understanding the value of virtue (the ancient greek definition)  and salient commitment to stay steadfast despite life unpredictability 

the poetic irony of john work reveal the great multiplicities of this world and the worlds we create within ourselves  he did not shy away from the unseemly, instead he included it alongside the good    rainbows and ridges  so to speak   to paint beautiful, but happenstance landscape (bob ross approved) am sad to know will never get to see john perform live  even sadder still, to think about the cause of death and how it has revealed vulnerability in so many confused or scared souls  in sense, knowing john was out there quelled lot of my frustrations with humanity, because just like his songs, he reminded me that life complexities reflect on surface like broken glass bursting with fragments of light  it never as simple as it seems wrote poem right after his death that was promptly tucked away  with some room and second look at it, am quite happy wrote it and wanted to share with his family and friends, fellow appreciators, just another token of appreciation for john and the gifts he gave us with his music

john you just joined

that great band in the sky

there been lot of bad news

but this made me cry

you sang about loving

you sang about loss

you knew what you stood for

and how much that cost

your words cut through leather

oh fire they stoke

distilling humanity

in quick witted joke

old cowboy crooners

songs that keep me company

of all the musicians to lose

in this damn quarantine

still stuck in this lockdown

with nowhere to be

but ll keep playing your music

prine,"summer end    song analysis despite having been through various troubling seasons in his life due to multiple bouts of cancer and divorces, john prine left an artistic legacy that is unprecedented in the realm of country singers think that this song allows room for optimism with side of melancholy  he combines uplifting major melodies with darker changes to lyrically spoken words  he gives weight to seemingly mundane images like towels drying on clothesline and confidently expresses clear narratives through each song without any need for automated background production  this song feels unique to study during the age of the coronavirus pandemic  despite global shifts to civilization at large, the cycles of nature move forward no matter what  in ""the tree of forgiveness"", he leaves it up to the listener to take what they will from his straightforward messages and invites people to lean into difficult emotional experiences to positively engage with others "
