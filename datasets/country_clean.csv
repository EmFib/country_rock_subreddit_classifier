it occurred to me just now that lot of people are depressed in the middle of winter, lots of people have had their heroes and industry friends  die this year, and it might just be good time to send folks who are still around some fan mail, to let them know we re thinking about them did things like send people links to reddit threads where we were talking about them, among other things m pretty sure it was appreciated "

during the song, we learn that she is depressed, that they tried treatment from doctors in the city, and that nothing seems to help 

at the end, we find out they had child  they went for picnic  the husband struck the child with his car by accident, killing him  they were picking wildwood flowers

this past two weeks it was dottie west and bucky covington have never really listen to dottie west music but know of an old timer that listened to her and loretta lynn that made me curious and sparked my interest  

it been very interesting and also some saddening reading about dottie west  of course, pulled many of her songs to listen to them during the process as well 

on another note, also tried to find bucky covington, again! remember when he first appeared and then it seemed like all the sudden he was gone ve always wondered what happened to him  

do any of you know what happened to bucky covington? 

this past week found out about his daughter and what happened there and wondered if that was the reason he dropped country music or if there was another reason but mostly wonder if he ever going to make comeback  either way, could not find my answer  in all my searching the web again all these years later still cannot find the answer to, what happened to him?

one of the broken hearted, especially one who checked out on life recently or long time ago, with little help from my bro jesus, want to bring your heart back to life, and give you something 
to live for  don check out of life if someone checked out with your wife  don let em have that "" m very very very creative   if can find some good tunes, it would help me write these songs am scientist, know how important education is even on farm live on farm in like 1700s or 1800s farm house where m typing this up now ve tossed my hand in the realm of weird al, but unless you understand the toxicity of the game of league of legends, you won get this rushed production on this, could sing better if tried more than just few takes m thinking of redoing the song  you re on tmz or ""you belong to me"" by calling it,  watching afv song about america funniest home videos 

this is all hobbyist level interest now m actually pro gamer solo indie game developer   but eventually it gets tired to mass game and code    it takes toll for your brain to always be at full hyperactive all out mode   and sitting down listening to country songs and writing country songs heals the soul and comforts the heart

as was listening to waylon the other day it struck me odd as to how similar the songs ""i ve always been crazy"" and ""turtles all the way down"" sound to me  but m not sure if it just my lack of exposure country music googled around bit and it seems like sturgill accepts but doesn exactly agree with the comparisons of him waylon  but based on the music alone, at least on these two songs, they seem very similar "

the main song that comes up in google is ""texas in my rear view mirror"" but don think that is it because the lyrics do not mention someone really, just about whole town state  the songwriter is really into obscure music so it may not be something easily found through google 

any ideas? the song has to be before 1991 because that is when the band song came was written

country,"new to modern country music, m finding it hard to break into anything other than cody jinks m fan of all music listen to lot of classic rock  amp  indie rock, bit of hip hop  amp  metal, and recently ve been exploring country ve been fan of folk music for while  john prine, blaze foley, townes van zandt, neil young, and more  but that was the most ""country"" really ventured into 

recently ve been exploring the genre more, and while do enjoy good storytelling    

   quick tangent   

storytelling?  the highwaymen take the cake, but in terms of modern music colter wall is unbeatable can really get into tyler childers (not sure what the general opinion of him is, but he reminds me of the dreaded 2012 mumford and sons era)  

     anyway  , while do enjoy good storytelling, need to be in certain mood    for the most part like to listen to something real and relatable    but m finding that to be really difficult in the country genre  

for me it cody jinks love how real he seems  he talks about his personal life and real issues which can sometimes relate with  sometimes wonder    do even like country, or do just like cody jinks?"

over the last couple of years have felt underwhelmed by mainstream country and have started listening to more red dirt texas americana folk country music and there are so many artists and songwriters who are incredibly talented appreciate seeing chris stapleton in the mix but how is it that morgan wallen is considered ""new artist"" when he was turning out hits back in 2018? keith urban was again nominated for male vocalist of the year? both carrie underwood and miranda lambert have been nominated for female vocalist of the year every year for the last 18, maybe 19 (maybe 20??) years could go on don mean to diminish the talent exhibited by these artists but m tired of the monopoly held by artists groomed for radio  what about artists such as  colter wall (  charley crocket ( ( this song too (  tyler childers ( ( and because you can ever have enough tc (  shakey graves (  cody jinks (  randall king (  whiskey meyers ( (although  bury my bones ( is my personal favorite),  kaitlin butts ( the late  kylie rae harris (  jamie lin wilson (  courtney patton ( the list goes on and on

country,"what is your opinion on blake shelton ? know he is big name and all, but ask this question for reason  ever since could remember, always heard country music fans bitching about ""country not  being real country anymore, it stadium rock   "" or something along those lines  we ve all heard that before m sure was raised listening to alan jackson, george strait, shenandoah, clint black, and what people call ""the real country"" worship alan jackson like god and that is the country prefer and have always preferred  


however, there are some black shelton songs that are pretty good like ""the more drink"" and ""kiss my country ass"", but do have to admit that there is something that is just too ""hollywood"" about him  he just doesn have that country charm that alan jackson has had 


so, what is your opinion on him ? m sure this will turn into heated debate fairly easily, lol "

when the first cars movie came around, it introduced me to the first coumtry artist became fan of  brad paisley  whenever was in my dad or grandfather truck, always wanted to play the cars cd to hear his voice still am fan of the man to this day

it so ironic that very country american man music is so famous in middle eastern countries such as saudi arabia  country music was teaming with patriotic 9 11 grieving music when 9 11 happened and the hijackers were saudi arabian, so it really ironic  hell, alan jackson had famous 9 11 song called ""remember when"" 

anyway, am really surprised that my favorite country star music is popular in middle eastern countries out of all places  good music knows no bounds  americans (and everyone) has lot more in common with the world than it think it does "

country,"growth story of the south korea today we are going to know about the story of south korea who becomes developed nation from the underdeveloped country  to know about this first of all we have to know about south korea history 

modern history 

from 1910 to 1945 korea was colony of japanese empire  during the japan colonialism 8 companies were formed that have become very big today like lg, mitsubishi and many more those companies were started because there was lot of foreign trade at that time and japan traded heavily through korea  the majority of rich people in korea were japanese  

japan also attacked all the islands in the pacific region and this is the case during the world war  at that time, japan had exploited korea lot economically and korea came into the poorest areas of the world  there was also lot of hunger  when japan lost the world war in 1945, it surrendered that area and went back  the sub korean territory was divided into two parts the southern part had gone to the us and the northern to the ussr  from 1945 to 1960, the korean war continued in the meantime, up to 25  of the properties were damaged 

then how was the country recovered?
in 1950, when the first government was formed in korea, it brought the farm land reform act  under the act, the government privatized all the land in korea which was occupied by japan and distributed it among the poor farmers  in 1963, japan gave  800 million to korea as an economic co operation because it had done too much economic exploitation in korea  earlier in 1961, the military overthrew the their democratic party under the junta rule  at that time, korea was heavily dependent on foreign aid, due to this, koreans started building the structure of self supporting economy  and the first five year plan was brought our, that five year plan was focused on these things  agriculture, energy industries like electricity, coal mine, transport facilities like train, airport, roads and export payment was also taken care so that the balance of payment goes to surplus 

korea focused on heavy electronic industries from 1972 to 1981, which resulted in korea become the 11th largest economy in the world  similarly, korea moved from the list of very poor countries to the list of rich countries in 35 years  korea 30  of gdp started coming from the industry sector itself  it is also called miracle of han river, korea also hosted the olympics in 1988 

comparison india vs korea 
both south korea and india started with the agriculture based economy  but south korea brought structural transformation in its policies that opened up lot of doors for foreign markets in the country  and their export oriented policies proved to be the trump card for the korea 

south korea had very good growth rate from the 1960 to early 2000 but currently india is one of the fastest growing economy in the world  as you have seen in this trend, the green trend is of south korea and the blue one is of india  in the initial trend, south korea is in very good growth from india  but india has been growing much better than korea since 2000  

if we now talk about gdp, south korea gdp is  1 626 trillion and it comes in the 12th rank of the world  at the same time, india gdp is  3 2 trillion and it is ranked 5th in the world  but when we talk about per capita income then these facts becomes reversed korea per capita income is  31,430 and it ranks 27th in the world whereas per capita income of india is  2,171 and it is ranked 139th in the world 

human development index that is hdi it a composite mixture of health, education, life expectancy and per capita income  india has got 0 647 points in this, which comes in the medium range  on the other hand, south korea has got 0 906 points which comes in very high range  if we talk about rankings, india is at 129th position and korea is at 22nd position  inequality of income is almost common in india and south korea  according to oxfam report india 1  population holds the 73  wealth of the country 


south korea has greatly promoted the education in its country  that why today korea has become the territory in the world where most people are graduated  and south korea along with taiwan, singapore and hong kong are in the list of developed countries of asia  there has been loss in the stock market many times and the reason is the military crisis of the north korea  it has brought many influences in the financial market of south korea

country,"ten rules of mainstream country   warning  some content in this post may provoke controversy  

 amp  x200b 

                                                                                                                     

hello there  this is mainstream country, incorporated  we are responding to your email which stated your desire to officially enter the country music scene  below are 10 tips that should help you reach level of prominence within our great community 

1  nashville is home to some top notch percussionists who can realistically recreate any beat imaginable within couple of attempts  their excellence must be heard through the most simplistic beats possible  snapping every other quarter note would be an ideal condition 
2  our iheart stations cycle between dozen songs on given day, ensuring that the listener is engaged at all times  more modern setups are mostly irrelevant, but we have gotten few viral hits through them, so at least they entice the younglings 
3  although country as genre is often seen in contrasting light with the current pop scene, never hesitate to replicate trend that comes with it, as it will lead to spot on the hot 100 
4  if you criticize us in any fashion, we have the means to appropriately respond  don expect guest appearance on  the bachelor  if we lack an intimate connection 
5  incorporate references to pickup trucking in your lyrics (whether it be the truck itself or some outside conditions), no matter how poorly the resulting metaphor comes out  ford, gm, and dodge all love it 
6  on similar line, promote beer recklessly whenever humanly possible  the multi billion dollar corporations love the free advertising that translates to long term alcohol addictions that are sure to cause absolutely no harm to the consumer or any victims unfortunate enough to stand in their way 
7  occasionally put on christain persona  people look at idols that serve god full time with admiration  in situations where the 6th  amp  7th rules conflict, the 6th is to be paramount 
8  if you are not white, see us when you gain credit on the pop or rock charts and we may hook you up with featured role that won show up on radio play  don expect us to give you any real attention until you have set multiple records in more popular scene 
9  unless you ve established yourself on the scene, if you happen to be female, don expect lot of attention know songs detailing relationships make up majority these days, but our current business model works best if guy lavishes girl with praise, not the other way around 
10  speaking of ""relationship songs"", make sure the male protagonist in question lavishes her date solely in physical terms and not in factors that require further dimension  the protagonist is allowed and even encouraged to focus on this concept to an excessive degree  ""eyes on you"" is terrific demonstration of it, and we are proud that it managed to make the year end hot 100 

we hope that this letter has given you valuable insight into the inner workings of our hit producing operation  provided you are willing to heed the above points, you should become huge in no time!

sincerely,

igor rich

however! m more interested in learning more about ountry  country m listening to chris stapleton right now and am in love  this sound definitely captures more of what always hear country is about (the lyricism, the sound, the stories, etc ), but clearly didn hold up in the mainstream country radio scene  even in pop music, my favorite songs are my favorites because of the lyrics, so this is side of country that think can really get into would really appreciate some suggestions for similar stuff  

if you could recommend me five albums that really do the genre justice and would be good introduction to someone like me, what would they be?"

country,"thank you sam hunt for being there for the up amp  down for those of you that aren familiar with sam hunt, he a country pop singer that just happened to be with me throughout my relationship 

it started 3 years ago in the summer of 2017 when sam hunt released the song ""body like back road""  it a song about meeting girl, getting to know her, and eventually building that love where you know every curve of her like being able to drive back road with your eyes closed 

it was the summer of 2017 when first laid eyes on my ex gf  after that first meeting, was infatuated with her  all summer long, ""body like back road"" was the song played on repeat with my ex gf on my mind would picture the first time met her and ""almost falling out my chair "" imagined myself going ""way back like cadillac seats"" with her in the future couldn get enough of the girl and this song has been emotionally significant to me  it reminds me of time when did not want anything in the world other than getting to know this girl 

fast forward 3 years later to the summer of 2020 where sam hunt has released his new song ""hard to forget""  my ex and were having rough times and she was unhappy in our relationship 

we ended our 3 year relationship 2 days ago 

the words in ""hard to forget"" now hit home for me got to know her ""body like back road"" and we did go ""way back like cadillac seats "" now, she playing ""hard to forget"" 

it makes me tear up hearing sam hunt knowing that ve emotionally connected to his voice and music as something to celebrate and be joyful about 

3 years later, sam hunt is still with me and helping me get through this situation  although, it is no longer an excitement that he brings  it is the pain of being so excited to get to know somebody, living amazing memories with them, and now going through the dumps of trying to forget them 

so, thank you sam hunt for being with me through the up and down you re music will always bring me comfort "

it generally just girl with nice voice, guitar and microphone  and usually find the songs pretty touching  

it doesn have the up and down craziness or twanginess of some country songs don know what to google and can find an example to post 

sorry, know didn give you lot to go off of but thats the best could do 

edit should add that heard song years ago that could never find the name of, the chorus went something like

blah blah blah ""is the human condition"" blah blah blah ""is my premonition""

lol, long shot but figured should post it in the slim chance someone recognizes it 

the vocal style for the songs m thinking about is kinda like this song  "

country,"the us h1b visa is temporaily suspended  the   us h1b visa latest news   here  usa president donald trump has temporarily cancelled the h1b visa system maybe till the year end and has ordered his management to follow merit based immigration  the h1b visa and other work visas are being suspended for some time and now, the merit based system will prioritise the highest skilled workers to american jobs  this has made lot of indian students and employees very anxious 

the current cap on h1b visas is only 85,000 which can be supplied every year and they are distributed through random h1b visa lottery  trump has now directed to eliminate the lottery system and instead use salary ranking selection process so that the top 85,000 salary offers to get the us h1b visa 2020 

president has also asked for the current wage calculation system to be cleaned up according to the h1b wages  as per officials, they are planning to set the current wage floor at the 50th percentile so the candidate who gets the h1b visa will be in the upper end of earnings 

the usa is basically ensuring that only the highest skilled applicants are taken in from foreign labour so that it increases the opportunity for american people to get jobs  thus, as per the new regulations, both the skill level as well as the wage level of h1b applicants have to be high to get the approval "
