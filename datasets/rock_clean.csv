rock,"in light of the recent post, what are your favorite newer rock bands? what bands do you guys love?? 

for me its    

queens of the stone age   their first few releases were straight up rock but the last couple have had lighter tone  

the strokes   alt rock indie 

fantastic negrito   modern day blues rock   first 2 records are straight up blues but his third incorporates some funk and soul  

fratellis   catchy as hell, straight forward fun rock  

sturgill simpson   more on the country americana side  super diverse artist  his sound  amp  fury album sounds like psychedelic zz topp 

uncle acid and the deadbeats   very sabbathy type riffs, like if the beatles were satanic  

ghost   an occult rock metal band, pretty well known probably  

green lung   another occult band, very catchy, sabbath inspired as well

mastodon   these guys are metal  if you really dig the heavy sound, check out their first two  for cleaner vocals start from their most recent album, emperor of sand, and go backwards  crack the skye is badass  

baronness   like mastodon, these guys can get more on the metal side  their riffs are super unique  

big wreck slightly older band, vocals very similar to chris cornell, but instrumentally they re bit different  

the glorious sons   straight up rock  

the struts   70s glam rock reborn

rock,"what would you do if you were me? didn go to college, haven yet had family, and it all because m keeping dream alive 

ten years ago finished writing my latest rock album sang and played all parts and self recorded and produced it to the best of my ability and learned lot about production along the way  it is for all intents and purposes finished, awaiting one final mixdown 

but this is music wrote ten whole years ago, and ve learned few other things since then 

  my music has parts that are interesting, and parts that are not know that m my own worst critic, but even in the way other people react to it can tell that my songs can be rather mediocre and lacking at times  maybe it because try to do everything by myself, maybe because let it get so old while tending to other matters (and perhaps my musical tastes have shifted), but the end result is that my favorite bands put my own music to shame  it crazy to see all this wonderful art happening all around me and wonder what real contribution truly have to give to music  is it even worth doing anymore when so many others are already doing it better?

  it hard to get people to listen to my music don know where to go or what to do to make this happen  it not like high school where could just make cd and hand it out to people 

  my body is unreliable, especially my voice have severe asthma which leads to bouts of bronchitis and my voice becomes hard to manipulate m not sure would hold up to tour in the traditional sense  plus now m getting older look rather young but it coming up quick 

however, now for the first time in my life actually have  money don have much, but now can pay people to do things for me, because have decent job and live frugally have pay coming in that would support small family, and right now it just me, if that gives you an idea have the resources and drive to start something really good, and want it to rock hard  but m wondering if should hire pro musicians and push this music ve already written and recorded, or if should start collaborative band instead 

if started band instead, then could stay on guitar instead of singing  that would mean my voice wouldn be quite the issue that it is could sing backing vocals  the thing is ve heard m actually pretty good singer though and it would be kind of shame  but if can rely on my voice anyway then why put myself in spot where won be able to come through?

plus the work would be more distributed could maintain creative input and not get lagged down with the monumental task that is creating good rock album by yourself, and subsequently taking over decade to do it like did this last time could also just hire my own band for my own music though, and it would be more expensive and would do more work, but would maintain complete creative control  no one messing with my vision know this is going to come across as bit of self promo post just need to know whether or not my music is good enough to roll with can get any good feedback on wearethemusicmakers because they re mostly electronic over there don know what can do for you all in return except tell you that you have helped someone out with nagging problem that has to do with the very purpose of my life as have seen it since was 12 years old 

the last mix made of my latest album is located here think the highlights are ""skeleton key"", ""culture of killing"", ""white buffalo"", and ""dandy differential"" 

please be totally honest with me reddit  does this music from 2010 still stand chance? or should look to other horizons?"

here the invite   "
rock,"why is the band chicago largely forgotten about when compared to other rock groups? hello redditors,

as some say, music is universal language, we cannot go anywhere without hearing song, whether in our cars, in an elevator, or in the park, it brings us together  with this in account, many of us share common popular artists bands that we enjoy and listen to  in fact, usually these popular artists bands have long lasting legacy that people talk about decades after their initial success 

this brings me to my post, about band that was insanely popular that many people are aware of, and an equal amount of people are not aware of or have even heard of   chicago ll be honest, the only time had heard of the band chicago was when talking to people 50 , and this is just the truth  people know who are younger, and into the older music have never mentioned chicago when mentioning bands and artists from the 70s and 80s that were popular have mentioned them when talking of the old bands, and virtually nobody happen to know has heard of them which is surprising, for reasons ll list later on 

as am writing this post, took quick glance at their popular songs and gave them all whirl  the only songs by them that knew, and had heard before this post, were the songs ""25 or 6 to 4"", ""old days"", ""you re the inspiration"" and ""what kind of man would be?""  this amazes me because chicago has had more hits than most artists that people are fans of in the past and present 

chicago has had whopping 35 hit singles, 18 hugely successful albums, and highly successful live album  they also had big hits ranging from the early 70s to the early 90s, and multiple albums with certifications  chicago is also one of the best selling musical acts in the world, they have had more record sales than other arguable more well known artists such as johnny cash, e , the doors, earth wind and fire, and usher  this part does not really matter, but it is very interesting to know this 

what amazes me more than anything else is that chicago has had huge success yet seem to be relatively unknown to most people who are not 55   all the artists have listed in this post are probably more well known to most people, yet chicago, with all the huge success between the early 70s and early 90s remains more obscure band of the past than say the beach boys, bon jovi or red hot chili peppers, even if they have had huge success and sales 

why is chicago largely unmentioned when talking of the great bands? why is this the case when people bought their work, their singles, and concerts, how is it that this band has not made an impact on later generations as band like led zeppelin or the rolling stones have?"

rock,"serbian portal porkulum has proclaimed five bests alternative rock songs ever, here is the link and translation   

 amp  x200b 

1     sonic youth   schizophrenia

while there is consensus among the alternative  community  that daydream nation is the best album from sonic youth, sister has always worked more for me because it sounds more natural  and especially the song that opens the album  from the very beginning to the end, the song walks with incredible spontaneity from major to minor, from male to female vocals, all in four minutes that represent all the recognizable elements of this magical band  the text is also particularly interesting, it carries an emotional line that sonic youth is not known for d bet this is combination of kim gordon autobiography (i know she had brother with serious mental health issues) and the sf that this almost so conceptual album is interspersed with  it hard to waste words on the production, everything sounds as warm as if you were by campfire and the master is low so that everything can be heard without crackling  classic par excellence  in time, sister will threaten the reputation of daydream nation 

2  swans   raping slave

there are few bands that start listening to without ever breaking up with them, at least for short time  the swans are just that case, ve been listening to all their phases for twenty years, and the most fascinating thing about them is that they ""go with their heads where others can with their legs"" that brutality, animality, almost savagery in music connected with unquestionable talent is rare occurrence in music  the earliest, no wave phase brings that scent of new york sewage associated with desperate intermigrant artistry without calculations and that why this subgenre has always been interesting to me  the song raping slave best shows that extremity in sound and that why chose it  it something you have to indulge in without thinking, here the brain only interferes with the experience myself try to channel my aggression through music, because despite my peacefulness, am aware that am also an animal and that could easily have killed someone  songs like this help you not to do that  not because of some pseudo christianity or because would feel sorry for the victim, but no animal likes to end up in cage  we have to be little honest with ourselves sometimes  michael gira is the champion of that 

 amp  x200b 

3  the sonics   the witch

let be clear, the production of the sixties is the best ever and everything that came after is an imitation, more or less successful  this song represents one of the beginnings of true reflection of rock and roll and american aesthetics towards the satanic in itself, that is  which is why rock and roll is both disputed and adored at the same time  fear of women, who don look like lidle cashiers, an incredibly furious gig, lyrics that express the essence of pagan narratives, and guitars that wisely skipped the third string in chord, tells me that these guys weren even aware they were the forerunner of real punk  rock  not this one today, which is just pseudo sociological pseudo struggle of people who only look to one side of the world  rock and roll should not be so banal  he has to go deep and far, telling little stories, not the other way around  this song is the epitome of that  at the same time, the whole thing was recorded on only two microphones m waiting for band today to sound like that with that equipment  you have to practice little with your fingers and in your head  an absolute recommendation to those who want to drink the water from the source 

 amp  x200b 

4  can   mary, mary so contrary

although am primarily fan of american and british performers, occasionally made trips to the continental part of europe, and the german can immediately caught my eye like their early phase with malcolm mppney the most, although also appreciate damo suzuki  this old lulaby that they reworked in their own ""post rock before post rock"" way is the one come back listening the most  the melancholy of mooney voice, with superb guitar work and mild hypnosis of the whole band, is for me the antipode to the previously described song, the gentle side of rock and roll, but without slime song that is the forerunner of pink floyd ""echoes"" in terms of sensibility, and as such deserves attention and careful listening again 

 amp  x200b 

5  the beatles   she said, she said

we all know who and what the beatles are and won brag about that never noticed that any of those strong old and vassal beatles fans ever pointed out and uploaded this thing in their articles and posts pity  to me, this is beautiful song from their best album revolver, which is perfect blend of older blues with newer psychedelic works  in addition to the fascinating melody, and the double vocal lines (for which the beatles are generally known), drumwork of ringo starr clogs the mouths of all smart people who belittle him school example that drugs can sometimes bring something good to world culture, if you are willing to sacrifice your body and health  anyway, m sorry that started listening to this band only at the age of 25, because learned lot from them when it comes to making arrangements  rock and roll is music of pain and the entertaining part in it should serve only as spice, catalyst of emotions am afraid that in the last twenty years the situation has changed upside down "

so, this song is praised because it more than 6 minutes long, it has some time signature changes and parts that sound different to one another  which is not bad at all  but bands like king crimson, yes, pink floyd, jethro tull or genesis were already making 10 minute epics and the other things mentioned above before this song came out, and yet, people are constantly polishing their pogo sticks to the fact that this song is ""different"" for doing stuff that has already been done way before bohemian rhapsody was even thought  don get me wrong, actually really enjoy boh rap  but why are people constantly saying that it the best song ever? really don get it  but could also be wrong would love to see what you think below

rock,"the definitive trapt album ranking 8  amalgamation  never stuck as true trapt album, though the album isn bad  just doesn blend well with rest of discography  although decent nu metal album for its time, you be hard pressed to argue this much higher than bottom 3 album from trapt  best song   instra  (easily, rest of album sounds like one long track, even though local scene seems to appreciate  who am )

7  shadow work  honestly their most disappointing yet  to go from dna to this doesn make any sense to me  progression of writing is incomprehensible  no real bangers like the other albums  not as catchy as before  nothing  stuck really hope they go back to the heavier, dna style of writing for their next album d rather listen to amalgamation than this, but it is more trapt esque, just not the side we like  best song   make it out alive 

6  only through the pain  trapt was unable to create the same feel they did from the first two albums  cheesy lyrics fail to give way to decent vocal melodies  no real intriguing guitar riffs  easily huge step back from their second release   black rose  sounds like mediocre off shore island rock band that plays at the local hole in the wall version of ruby tuesday best song   curiosity kills 


5  trapt  you cannot argue with the success of this record  obviously it has multiple single hard hitters, but overall the tracks flow together nicely  not as revolutionary as whole, but who can forget the timeless opener, the lovely chorus of  echo,  or the slippery lead work in  these walls   immaturity hinders this album as the rest of the album feels slightly rushed in writing and creativity  best song   headstrong  (runner up,  still frame,  flawless guitar writing for 2000s rock)

4  reborn  this front heavy album is slight step back from no apologies only because it fails to carry the same level of energy the first 4 songs bring to the table  kind of middle tier album, but above the first release due to its maturity in writing  guitars almost dwell as we are not alone part 2 offering  best song   experience  ( bring it  for the gym or game day)

3  no apologies culmination of what we ve been waiting for, trapt decides to go back to some darker more intense lyrics with harder hitting riffs  not quite the level of dna on uniqueness or intricate syncopated rhythms, but man does the album catch your attention with every listen   sound off  separates itself as stand up  knock off thanks to its thrashing main riff and light hearted chorus  listen to this for mature yet classic trapt sound  best song   no apologies  (the trapt ballad that finally outshines its hard hitters)

2  dna  the only thing holding this album back is nostalgia, aka, time  with complex melodies, dark guitar riffs and lyrics, and some of the deeper story lines we ve ever heard from trapt, the boys hit hard with some of their best songs ever, including  anchor  and  human   this album does not fail to deliver refreshing take on 2000s hard rock  please go back and improve upon this type of writing guarantee if they do, it will be the best trapt record yet  best song   unforgiven 

1  someone in control  while the self titled album may be more well known thanks to headstrong, this album provided much more diverse guitar work, growth in musicianship, and flawless mix  you can definitely hear difference in passion and care taken in the vocals and melodies offered here  there is not weak link in this set believe this style came little early to be popular  maybe with some more time, this album would ve stuck out as favorite amongst generation  after 2 listens, you ll be hooked and catching yourself singing along as if these songs were written for your personal season of life, wherever it finds you  best song   waiting "

rock,"contrarian opinion  grunge did not actually kill 80 rock hair metal    at least not directly say this as fan of rock music from all decades (60s and 90s are probably my overall favorite decades) was very young at the time (early 90s), but as music history nerd, have to say imo, that many of the 80 heavyweights knocked themselves out of popular culture  sure, grunge made sure that there would be no more superstars made out of bands like winger, firehouse or nelson  many established, respected acts from that time seemed to implode in the early 90 s, inconceivably  although some soldiered on and had some of their greatest successes  

guns roses  the obvious place to start  they had two massively successful albums (uyi 1 and uyi 2) released in september 1991  the same month  nevermind  and metallica black album was released  they embarked on massive 2 year tour  they lost izzy near the start of this tour  the founding members would (to this day) not release an album of original material again  apart from the covers album  the spaghetti incident  (1993) and axl chinese democracy  in 2008, nothing in the way of new album has come along from the core members, axl and slash believe they would have stayed relevant and successful throughout the 90 and beyond (though they have been doing well recently as live act) had they pulled together, confronted their issues and continued to write  they voluntarily took themselves out of the center of pop culture in the 90s 

motley crue  one of the most commercially successful bands of the 80 might have hit their peak with the  dr  feelgood  album in 1989  tensions then caused the band to let vince neil go in 1990  hard to soldier on without your lead singer  when they reunited, well into the 90s, they would try to make grungy album, to acclimate to climate where grunge was already on its way out of the zeitgeist  (this would become theme with other 80 artists) 

def leppard  what an 80s juggernaut  hysteria (1987) is one of the most successful rock albums of all time  def leppard has dealt with its share of tragedies  the loss of drummer rick allen arm in the mid 80s and guitarist steve clark would lose his life in his battle with alcoholism in early  91  despite all of that, def leppard releases  adrenalize  in the spring of 1992 and it debuts at number 1, in the midst of the grunge craze  their music was still massively popular  they wouldn release an album of all new material for another 4 years   where they try to imitate the grunge aesthetic (slang 1996)  

bon jovi  no real bumps in this bands career, as far as popularity  they restructured their sound to pivot away from hard rock and earned much crossover success writing ballads like  always  and had another peak in 2000 with their album  crush   most notably the single  it my life   much success in the country music field as well  

skid row  it seems as though lot of people expected this to be the next gnr  their sophomore album  slave to the grind  is hard rock masterpiece that reached  1 on the billboard charts in 1991  as we ve seen before, taking 4 years off can seem like 100 years in pop culture  they wouldn put out new album until 1995 (subhuman race), which also attempted to imitate fading grunge scene, though an underrated album imo  they would fire singer sebastian bach the next year over tour plans to open for kiss and the rest is history 

van halen  if there is any proof that grunge didn destroy 80 establishment rock, it the story of van halen  or van hagar, if you prefer  every album vh released from the mid 80s until the mid 90s reached  1  vh remained massively popular throughout the years, no matter what the popular culture was at the time   right now  beat out def leppard, nirvana and the red hot chili peppers at the 1992 mtv vma (back when the vma somewhat mattered) for video of the year  the 1995 album  balance  was another number 1 album, against all odds  they would fire hagar the next year and fade into obscurity, as far as new material is concerned 

many of these 80s bands stayed successful throughout the 90s and many shot themselves in the foot  to be fair, it hard to compete with the likes of nirvana, aic, soundgarden, pearl jam, smashing pumpkins, etc  (nirvana and aic are in my top 10 favorite bands)  some of these feuding 80s bands never gave themselves chance, while we forget that some still thrived  (sorry this was so long tend to ramble ) thoughts?"

it a bunch of old people that used to be extroverts in highschool and argue about what guitarrists are more expressive or some bullshit based merely on nostalgia and the body performance over the actual melody, just how normies nowadays just care about the lyrics and the instrumental is literally just minimalistic drums 

and also there people that hate other players and music even though it the same goddamn genre, just because for them they have no emotion or the lyrics suck ve heard people say that frank zappa lyrics are genius when they were literally joke

now m not saying this album had to compete with legendary albums of the genre, but how can anyone compare them stylistically? where are the riffs? where are the solos? the drum machine they used on zz top eliminator record sounded more like real drums than the polished shit on miley album m not totally convinced this woman has actually heard metallica song in her life 

apparently wearing leather jacket, writing slightly edgy lyrics and sticking your tongue out while writing pop music makes it rock roll album in 2020  this is what the genre has fallen to  sigh "

rock,"where to go after listing to pearl jam s, ten while peaking on lsd (first time ever hearing rock) hello pearl jam lovers am asking for your guidance right now as to what rock albums artists to start listening to now after an experience recently had with pearl jam album, ten  if you don read anything further just know  that had never been exposed to the wide genre of rock roll until listened to the album while on acid this past summer  this was an amazing experience and want to continue on in my journey through this genre of music went through the rest of pearl jam music like vs and vitalogy  but need guidance on where to go from here    what do listen to next in this process? please drop albums, artists, songs, anything that you think would organically introduce me to this music  below is my account of first listening to ten while getting down to business in heroic dose acid journey 

          from the moment vedder voice comes piercing onto the scene in once, getting my attention and telling me with the passion in his throat that the next hour of my life is going to be flux of life altering experiences  to mike mccreedy at the end of even flow, taking my brain with his fingers and mushing and molding it, making me twist in circles as he brings his nasty, beast of guitar to life  to the alive song where the lyrics remind me 20 year old scarred, beaten down, unsure, unpredictable, erratic, hormonal, abused, raggy,, drug ridden, depressed and sometimes suicidal human being   that m still alive    at this point m spiritually consumed with every individual sound radiating from friend small speaker playing the godly album  to the why go track which acts as segway for me between 2 strings of songs that are the closest things to perfection have ever heard  the guitars in this track lead me through this tunnel beaming with lights that leads from the gut wrenching alive track to new, fresh, reset foundation of song in black     all the while vedder is whispering to us walking through the tunnel and questioning us saying,  why go home? why go home? why go home?  because at this point you re locked into what about to come and there is no disengaging from the sonic phenomenon that must continue on  so  comes the sensual, slow buildup of black which for me lays the ground work and sets your energy at exactly the place is must be to experience jeremy  black is preparing me but not taking me to the tippy top of the mountain quite yet  by the time jeremy comes on and m consumed in this storytelling magic, am living inside the picture being painted with 10x heightened emotions and in my mind the jeremy figure is this moving picture of an futuristic interpretation of the human race staying still but exerting force that tingles my body and am unable to control     he communicates with me the explanation of life and as the vocals say  uw, uw, uw, uw  over and over in the background, close my eyes for the next 10 minutes and in completely black space, communicate directly with the spirit of my late grandfather  midway through the ten minutes, open my eyes for 5 seconds and yell in unison with vedder  what the fuck is this world  at the start of porch and might remind you ve never heard any of these songs before in my life  after conversation with my grandfather that held enough content to last lifetime of talking with the most interesting person in the world, wake up right as the distorted guitar playing begins in the second to last song, deep  furiously engaged with every note that jeff ament and mccready rip throughout the track, begin the peak  ok, release comes on and have tears building up already in the corners of my eyes  all the baggage that have accumulated in my 20 years of life comes falling out of every hole in my body when ll hold the pain          release meeeeeeeeeeee pee myself, tears flowing out like light rainshower, friends say my voice starts continuous shrieking  then  oh dear dad  can you see me now? am myself  like you somehow  (myself having had severe issues with my father figure) and m not even sure how translated the words just seeing as the state was in but they set me over the edge and blacked out for 20 minutes was breathing for the whole 20 minutes thankfully but it just freaked out my tripping friends "

is this the end? my final words to you

rock,"i gave up my dreams of being rock star, so to speak, and ve never felt better now have full time job, quit smoking weed, also quit video games entirely, live frugally so money is rolling in  the things ve neglected for so long just to support musician lifestyle are now being tended to may even start family if things go that way had these delusions that just because d been making music since was 12, it was a) the only thing would ever be good at and b) am better musician than most  both turned out to be false and was chasing bad investment don know who needs to see this but m posting it here anyway  you ll know if career in music making is right for you  if you re unsure, and especially if you re making sacrifices, put it away and get your life in order  if you want, you can come back to it later 

the truth is didn really give anything up m taking much needed break from it all to clean things up  it not quitting music, it putting higher priority on personal happiness 

everyone can tell if there is pain in your music  whether or not there a market for that is another story  it genre specific to degree  but in my case it did not help at all wanted to make rock music to change the world and lift people up, but was in no position to do so in my mind 

rock music will never die, but remember that you are mere mortal  anyone out there who is chasing this dream at the expense of their own true happiness, please learn from my mistakes  take care of yourself  first,  because without solid foundation, you cannot fully grow upward "

rock,"who, in your opinion, are the defining guitar players of each decade? my picks are 

50 chuck berry
60 jimi hendrix
70 jimmy page
80 van halen
90 kurt cobain
00 jack white
10 ??

my criteria for this is just those who stick out the most culturally, not who is the best player  (thus why many of these are obvious picks) they were all also active in decades outside of the one mentioned struggle picking one for the 10 s, because while think there are lot of great players, rock music hasn really been in the cultural spotlight  

feel free to give players from earlier decades as well am pretty unfamiliar with much before the 50 "

butt rock is often regarded as the red headed stepchild of modern rock music by the so called taste makers and the fans of more  legit  alternative music  why, few reasons  anti consumerist attitude (hating on mainstream acts that sell) in terms of the fans  and in terms of the tastemakers (music critics and journalists) general classist attitude towards butt rock and it primary audience, working class (usually but not exclusively white) people in areas like the rust belt  there a video by channel called the punk rock mba that explains it much better than could ever do that recommend to anyone interested  

in reality, butt rock like any other sub genre, if you can even call it that, has lot of good music and bad music  the bad music should get called out of course but the good and great bands should be acknowledged as well  bands like alter bridge, breaking benjamin, rise against, linkin park  im not gonna let hipsters living in their brooklyn apartments or neck bearded elitists define what is and isn good music  butt rock has some great stuff in it whether you guys admit it or not "

rock,"""what useless skill do you absolutely dominate?"" saw this question on popular, and do ever have an answer for it can make my own rock albums can sing and play guitar, bass, drums, and keyboard can record these instruments, rather than having to make fake synth versions, and mix them as well can make or otherwise come up with good album art can even manufacture my own cds on small scale with full color jewel case and on disc artwork have been honing my craft for over 20 years, and even decided not to go to college because of it ve produced around twenty lps, eps and demos for other bands and acts  bottom line is, can make rock music that sounds really, really good 

it just too bad 

  rock is    well can really say that in here, as per the rules  let just say it past its heyday 

  along those same lines, people have innovated many new and different ways to play rock music  these days, coming up with something original that is also rock music is not easy  why try when so many people are doing it so well already?

  the means of promoting rock music have changed drastically, and are typically dominated by other genres  playing live in person show means hosting covid 19 (or whatever pandemic is current) superspreader event 

  the compact disc is dead  people only buy those as collectibles 

  to degree, it seems no one cares about real instruments anymore could do just as well with synthesized drums and bass, as long as there real guitar and vocals could adapt to the times, or could just get job ll probably just do the second one  and m over it to be honest never saw myself as musical hobbyist, but ultimately that what ll be, despite whatever skills ve obtained feel like an idiot for not going to college could have been done with it in 4 6 years and living really cushy lifestyle  now m picking up the pieces over failed experiment  the things do for science know being an adult is about facing your broken dreams and settling down into reality  it just that took this really seriously, moreso than anyone ve ever known personally, and for very, very long time, and it still never panned out  so right now can confidently say that although dominate in my skillset, it is not only useless, it is  fucking stupid  to try to continue 

if you want to check out my music and make me smile for second then go ahead  this post wasn to try to promote my music though  so many people try to promote their music in here and it ignored made community few months ago at wewillrockyou and tried to get it off the ground in feeble attempt to establish base of new rock music on reddit, but as anyone can see it was failure as well 

if what m saying rings true with you, and you are invested in rock music and not already succeeding, the greatest advice can give you is to divest  pull out while you still can and cut your losses  the market is not looking good "

rock,"top 40 most played argentine rock songs in youtube   video link         

                                             

these are the top 40 most played argentine rock songs in youtube, by statistics from 8 october 2020 

  
the previous video about the evolution of rock in argentina from 1956 to 2020 (  took me 5 years and half to make, between the investigation, the selection and the production, it was very careful and meticulous work with lots of headaches, with the aim set on finding balance between the many trends that existed in argentine rock through the decades  and still    there were many (especially in taringa) who didn understand the ruleset to evaluate and choose the songs, and in their comments they demanded that the video have certain things that contradicted with the ruleset (for example, that band had more than just one song included in the list, or putting genre in year where it had already ceased to be protagonist of the musical scene of the moment) 

  
thus this video intends to be exactly the opposite to that video  just so you can see how ugly it a video where there isn a minimum of ""regulation"", anything goes here  multiple songs from the same band, multiple songs from the same year, artists repeated one after another, genre dominating all  this video intends to be an absolute and ruthless reign of the statistics, where argentine rock songs that gathered more plays naturally will be higher than the lesser played, no matter the name and the reputation of these  the images are put on purpose, so that you can see how repetitive is to see again and again the same band instead of having more variety  thus, this is video where the wild competition and the lack of regulation become the ""ruleset"" 

  
some final considerations   


  reading of books of the history of argentine rock, like the encyclopedia by marcelo fern ndez bitar, you will check that illya kuryaki, miranda and dread mar are all effectively included in the argentine rock scene 
  visit of websites like universo ep grafe, you will check that eddie pequenino, palito ortega and leo dan were crucial for rock making its first steps in argentina good while before los gatos appeared with ""la balsa"" 
  investigation of the musical scene beyond argentina borders, you will check how gigantic are in all the continent some artists like leo dan and bands like enanitos verdes, los aut nticos decadentes, la beriso and dread mar (the latter in fact managed to reach an untouched market until that moment for argentine artists  brazil) make it clear now  in this video there aren appearances from redonditos nor from indio solari as soloist (whose most played video has just 69 985 269 plays)    whatchagonnado, they couldn get enough people

girl name on the title or maybe just the chorus 
according to my recollection one hit wonder
the singer(author) had crush on 16 yo girl, (he was older) made song for her, present her with the song and think the girl say no
the song total hit, the band made deal with the girl and her family and she posted for the album cover
singer then said it was curse because they peak with the song and nothing else came after

obviously all of this is part of my idea of the song, of the story, of everything and it driving me crazy because it a song used to hum lot and suddenly just blank"
