ever heard of natan sharansky?

he was thrown into solitary confinement in the soviet union for years with nothing but his wits  no table  no light  no tiktok  no nuthin  

but he kept himself sane  in fact, he said he came out of prison more mentally robust than he went in! how, you ask? by playing chess   in his mind 

must be hard to remember every specific piece on the board, right? well natan sharansky played not one    not two    not three games simultaneously  he played  seven  simultaneous games of chess in his mind, sitting in his underwear in a windowless cell in siberia  but, that s not the craziest part    

he then went on to beat the world chess champion in israel after he was released 

pretty mad, huh  do you think you d be able to accomplish something similar? 

let me ask you this 

where does your mind go when there are no distractions? do you get more insightful when you spend time alone with your mind?

here s another mad prison related story  

charlie plumb, a prisoner of war in vietnam, managed to catalogue his entire existence from his earliest memory (at 3 years old) until the day of his imprisonment 

he could remember every book, every kid in his class, every lunch he had eaten, every movie he had ever watched, every word to every song, every girl he had kissed   just from spending a lot of time thinking about it 

if i asked you what you had for dinner 3 nights ago  would you remember? personally it would take me a while  now, what about 3,000 nights ago?

how would your life benefit, do you think, from having the clarity of thought that natan and charlie have?

if true clarity of thought comes from spending lots of time just thinking about stuff, then answer this for me   

how much of  your  life is spent listening to other people s ideas vs creating your own ideas from scratch? 

how often do you watch tv or listen to podcasts or read the news?

if some people have gained    sooo    much from being stripped of input for years   could you recreate that in your own life (without the kidnapping and torture)?

i mean we were all reduced to fewer inputs over the last few months  and what happened? we got bored, yep  but, we also got creative  we also got productive 

a lot of people are coming out of lockdown more mentally and physically healthy than ever  you might be one of them  this is because, in my opinion, we all had fewer inputs in our life which gave us more time to really  think  

so, what do you think you re capable of if you really spent time thinking about it? 

could you memorise an entire book? could you create an imagined world and populate it with complex characters? could you mentally map out the next 20 years of your career?

do you ever just sit and daydream about that kind of stuff while looking out the window for twenty minutes? or, close your eyes and consciously explore your mind? or, write a stream of consciousness diary?

if not, why not? do you drown out your own thoughts with background music or tv or something else?

the thing is   the better you get at sitting and doing nothing, the better you get at doing anything 

it s the secret to being funny, the secret to never running out of things to say, the secret to having original ideas, the secret to providing value in a work setting, the secret to being charismatic 

it s worth focusing some energy on "

0,"if there's a ""to do"" on my list for awhile, it's often because i haven't identified the very first concrete step i need to take to get it done  "
0,"if you're experiencing a wave of negative emotion  stress, depression, anger, or anxiety    learning how to center is a tremendous tool  here are 5 steps i've outlined  i call it centering because we take a mental and sensory inventory of our current environment and centering ourselves within that precise moment 

step 1   safety  get yourself to a safe place of comfort and security 

step 2   breathwork  begin focusing on breath, walking yourself through a breathing exercise while counting, (5 seconds inhale, hold 5 seconds, exhale 5, hold 5   then repeat)  try and breathe with your diaphragm and take an account of the movement of air going in and out of your lungs and watching your belly ebb 

step 3   sensory inventory  while doing this, try and perceive your immediate surroundings in as much detail as possible  think of it this way, you will have five ten minutes to try and remember as much detail as you can of your current place, (car, bedroom, bathroom, office, outside (which is the best))

  try to visually see everything as much as possible, what are the tones of the colors, the depth of detail in a texture, the shape of everything, the devil in the detail if you will 

  sense or physically feel everything too, the breath fluting in and out of your nostrils, is it warm or cold, is there a breeze, or some sun warming your shoulders, or an energy in the room?

  any smells or aromas, the sea, a forest, a lingering candle scent, food, a pet, dirty clothing   it doesn't matter what it is, good or bad, you're merely taking an account of it like doing inventory  you don't care what you're counting, you're just counting 

  hearing, this is my personal favorite  find and listen to, attend everything  bird song, critters outside, the washer dryer, people's chatter in the distant or muffled convo beyond a wall, a pet breathing, the wind rustling the leaves of a tree, traffic  like sonar, take your attention to each sound as it resonates with you 

  taste won't usually be too helpful here so concentrate on the other senses 

step 4   mantra  mentally or out loud repeat a mantra or prayer which resonates with you  repeat this as you continue with the previous steps, replacing the counting with a mantra  i like 

""i am safe, secure, and loved "" or ""my breath is steady, my mind is clear and settled, my body is calm, my heart is pure, i am tranquil, safe, and loved ""

step 5   memory recall or visualization  recall a special memory of yours, one in which you felt safe, loved and had fun or it  try recalling all the exacting detail as well as you're able  where you were, who if anyone you were with, how you felt (this is vital), the scenery or environment, etc  some of us cannot do this however because the anxiety is too much, so i lean on a visualization technique instead  i recommend speaking out loud here as it will help your mind step away from the dreadful thoughts as it's tasked with speaking out loud  paint the most perfect place to be, beachside villa or stroll or a forest sanctuary is great too  walk yourself through the experience  the palms or pines and how they sway, barefoot walking on warm sand or cool earth, the forest canopy and the sun breaking through it and warming you, or big puffy white clouds sailing over the ocean, the sound of a stream or the ocean tide, the smell of sea water of the fresh air of the forest, etc  paint out this place but as you do sprinkle statements such as, ""i feel so safe and loved here,"" or ""this place is my sanctuary, i feel free and my mind and body is serene,"" or ""i am loved, and i am love ""

hope this helps, i suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and the most torturous state of grief after the passing of my wife in 2014 but through a choice to live in a different way and do whatever was necessary to end my suffering  i was able to rise above it and now live a life of abundance, peace, manifestation, and love again  i teach this now to others and have dozens of videos explaining all the steps and i have some fun too trying to make people laugh 

i have a couple videos based solely on stress and anxiety which detail out what i've shared above in greater depth with a much better explanation and visuals  dm me if you'd like the link or check out my page and go from there 

there is hope for you and your struggle    there is a place, a version of you which is out there waiting for you two to merge  this future version is a person who smiles in public and it's authentic  this person laughs too, and doesn't have angst while going out in public, or speaking to another, or dread anything whatsoever  this person is confident, and secure with themselves, even proud and in love  this person helps others navigate their anxiety too!

please lmk if you have any questions and my heart goes out to you all

 amp  x200b 



enlightenment! you may spend your whole life seeking it, but never find it  you may never search for it or even know that it s possible, but reach it by accident  and you may live out your life ignorant of its existence, and die having never discovered your highest potential for happiness, self mastery, and creative brilliance   


the enlightened psychologist abraham maslow was the first to scientifically describe the fully enlightened person which he called the  self actualizing person   building on maslow s work through careful biographical study of the lives of self actualizing people, humanistic psychologist and biographer roman gelperin found their enlightenment to stem from a nearly identical handful of breakthrough experiences, which he will reveal to you in this book 

partly a firsthand account of the author s own accidental enlightenment, and partly a full biography of abraham maslow s rise to self actualization, this book will teach you how to identify, understand, and attain those key experiences of 

  unlocking the perennial method of using your mind to its fullest potential
  being fully at peace with yourself, by deconstructing your internal conflicts
  deriving a near constant joy, pleasure, and satisfaction from sheer existence
  half creating, half discovering your driving passion and unique purpose in life
  automatically evolving the self actualizing qualities of total honesty, supreme self confidence, natural creativity, effortless spontaneity, and independent thinking

by the end of this book, you will thoroughly understand what enlightenment is, how and why it occurs, and the ways to pursue it!"

0,"where are all the productivity addicts? am i alone? so i'm 47 and i've spent most of my 20's and 30's not reaching goals, mainly through lack of vision and also having self destructive habits, which have demolished any chance of progress 

  i've since ""woken up""   and have removed myself from 'self destructive habits', which has made life a lot easier and have since actually started completing goals, even exceeding them 

however, 100  of my friendship acquaintances circle contains people who ""just do enough"" and 'clock watch' at work and have almost no goals visions to do anything 

i am not being condescending here   as i was ""that guy"" for years   and would never turn my back on friendship acquaintances if i was to miraculously become a millionaire ceo, as i feel there are always benefits having a mixed variety of friends and i do not judge anybody, especially considering the past i have had 

  but i'm left feeling alone   and feeling a ""mug"", being the only person actually trying all day, every day to progress in life   and when i view my friends i see pictures of coffee shops, leisure and nothing that contains any sacrifice 

i have even had some people send me pictures of these 'leisure times', knowing that i am working hard, just to remind me that they think i am wasting my time  however, i would rather have a dream and go for it than become 70 something and regret not trying 

i recently graduated from uni this month and looking to get a career in a new field, and combine it with some niche knowledge that i have  so my dream is a realistic one that can come true, with a bit of visualisation  productivity      and ultimately luck as the icing on the cake!

0,"digital checklists for a zen productivity  amp  self care plan  most productivity tips and self care tips online are counterintuitive  they don't promote happiness and are more of hard to achieve goals than friendly suggestions

checklists actually work better  start with this   budget template  ( to assess your current situation and the right solution for it 

then move on to this   daily budget template  ( to streamline our finances, manage your expenses, and save more 

 amp  x200b 

    daily schedule

0,"i don't know how to mind my breath this week i closed 11,744 tabs (thank onetab) out of sheer frustration  i can barely mind my breath while sitting in the dark with the shades drawn and ear beds in which turn my office into a (very) poor man's sensory deprivation chamber  then my frenchy walks in, and my whole day is shot  so in an effort to fuck all that i bought a door stop, blinders and a keep out i'm meditating sign since my sock on the knob is taken by self love or with third parties 

unfortunately, this means social media goes too  so before parting to turn my 20 year bhikkhu career into something meaningful (not just a goddamn pipe dream where other things continually come first), i'm polling for some help  in an effort to foster consistent single object awareness outside of sitting meditation, i've covered my tummy in ben gay, super glued air pistol bbs to my gut (don't knock it til you try it) and impaled myself with (cauterized) thumbtacks covered with duct tape  and every damn time my wife gets home or the frenchy looks cute or my dad calls or i'm coding an app or my member looks longingly up with glee, my attention wanes 

my question is, how do you maintain constant and consistent attention on your breath throughout the days' activities?

thank you in advance,

az

here is the  link (

i've worked hard on this and as of now do not make any money on it, so i'd really appreciate if you checked it out! thank you  )"
0,"marcus aurelius once said  i have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others     if you are not putting yourself first in life, you are no better than a sheep  (   the happy life

what must you have in order to deem your life a success?

is it a mansion in the hollywood hills filled with instagram models?

maybe you need a ph d in chemistry framed on your wall?

perhaps you want to be a high powered executive? 

when i ask people this question, i get answers about material possessions, status symbols and prestigious accomplishments  

would these things make you happy?

i often wondered why many people who have everything (cars, money, girls and status) still look miserable 

the answer came to me through something called  hedonic adaptation  

in terms of material possessions and status symbols, our brains can never get enough (you can thank the neurotransmitter dopamine for this)  

have you ever wanted something really badly?

it might have been a car, an xbox, a trip to bali, or maybe a new job title  

when you got the thing you were excited and thrilled  

but eventually, the experience became normalized and you found yourself looking for a new shiny object to complete you 

your whole life this cycle keeps repeating, and yet you still tell yourself that the next goal will be the final conquest 

many successful people become depressed because they reach the summit only to realize it s the same old story  

why else would they need to buy 12 cars and 5 mansions? with nowhere else to go some of these people choose to exit the game via suicide or acts of debauchery 

but what if you lived your life differently?

what if instead of focusing only on the outside world you paid attention to living in accordance to your virtues  

here is how it works 

you create your own metrics by which you live such as 

  i m a loyal friend 

  i m patient with people 

  i m a respectful son 

  i m a creator and entrepreneur 

  i help other people realize their potential  

  i don t sell my integrity for money 

and every day you judge yourself based on how true you were to your standards  

society will never tell you true happiness is not a product of worldly success, 

because they wouldn t be able to take your money if you knew the truth  

true happiness comes from congruence between your actions and personal values 

we feel bad when we lie to people (unless we are sociopaths) because we are not being coherent with our values  

we feel bad when there is a disconnect between what we are doing and what our gut is telling us to do  

many people never sit down and create their own metrics for a successful life  

instead, they allow society and savvy marketers to tell them how they should be feeling 

i see it all the time from my coaching students 

there is an emptiness in their lives because they never took control 

it s not too late to regain control  

start today  this is a new way to live  

cheers,

isaac

p s there is nothing wrong with wanting to accomplish great things (i m all for it), just know why you want those things  don t do things just because other sheep are doing them

0,"awe  a short guide to a misunderstood state of mind awe doesn t seem to get mentioned much on  r zenhabits and it s such a wonderful emotion and state of consciousness that it deserves a post!

i had a notable recent experience during a mindful eating meditation which left me feeling euphoric  unfortunately, awe is a state of mind we lose as we age for no other reason than we stop paying attention and stop being curious  we fall into routines and fail to see the beauty in what we label  mundane   i remember vividly as a kid learning about the world and being in awe when new information shook my foundations  how much harder life becomes when we don t allow ourselves the opportunity for awe 

  what is awe?  

  we ve all felt awe in our lifetimes  stunned and silent, standing on a mountainside gazing across a valley to snow peaked caps, it dawns on us just how big the world is (or how small we are)  
  another more nuanced experience would be witnessing someone complete an heroic act of selflessness, like a firefighter running into a burning building to save a stranger s life   wow, what a hero!  
  two requirements are necessary for reaching a true awe state  (and i'm not talking about the overused term awesome)  
  firstly, perceived vastness  this is met when we recognise something much larger than ourselves  studies suggest this can be either physical size (e g  a mountain) or symbolic (e g  heroic firefighter) 
  secondly, a need for accommodation  there is a requirement for this realisation to alter our worldview, a remapping of our understanding of reality 

  psychological effects  

  there are a number of physiological and psychological effects  i ll just focus on the psychological benefits 
  small self  amp  humility   people often report feeling smaller after experiencing awe (due to perceived vastness)  in a study where participants were experimentally induced into an awe state, participants  presented a more balanced view of their strengths and weaknesses to others and acknowledged the contribution of outside forces   additionally, people higher in dispositional awe were rated more humble by their friends  
  cognitive accommodation   awe states lead people to think more critically about information and are less persuadable by weak arguments  (and gosh don t we need more of that right now)  plus, people that regularly experience awe states have a lower need for cognitive closure on concepts, they are more comfortable with nuance and operating in the grey zone 
  perception of time   we all lead busy lives without a second for ourselves  whilst awe doesn t help give you back time  ) it at least prevents one feeling so time restricted 
  interconnectedness   after experiencing awe states people report feeling higher levels of interconnectedness  perhaps due to perceived vastness one recognises one cannot be separate from what they are witnessing  furthermore, there are a number of second order positive effects created from feeling interconnected 
  positive mood  amp  well being   a virtual reality experience viewing high, snowy mountains induced high levels of awe and increased people s mood   

  awe comes in flavours  

  researchers believe not all awe is created equal  different triggers will elicit different types of awe 
  ability based awe   great respect for another s talents e g  an athlete or musician 
  virtue based awe   witnessing acts of selflessness or immense virtue e g  
  beauty based awe   stunned by beauty e g  work of art, natural scene or a person 
  supernatural causality based awe   an unknown cause considered glorious or terrifying e g  ghosts or angels 
  threat based awe   flavoured by fear e g  tornado, lightning storm or dangerous leader 
  the jury is still out whether all flavours of awe create all the same benefits 

  your experiences  

  as parts of the world emerge from coronavirus lockdown, after weeks trapped inside, we re now noticing parts of our world that we previously took for granted  this is a wonderful opportunity to remember 
  what moments of awe have you experienced lately?

 (if you re interested in this kind of thing, hangout with us at    awe seekers  ( a community for people to regain their sense of awe and wonder) "

0,"the risks of being mindless hi everyone  i recently finished ellen langer's excellent book mindfulness so wrote up some notes on being mindless  would love your thoughts 

  tldr  risks of being mindless  

  mindlessness is the opposite to mindfulness
  humans are excellent at pattern matching  we label and categorise to avoid wasting mental energy on situations we have previously met  mindlessness is when the mind depends heavily on past categories which fail to recognise the distinctions of the present situation 
  a narrow self image reduces our resilience  if we self identify with a small number of high level categories our feeling of self may be threatened when these categories are in jeopardy 
  our ethics are connected to categories  by mindlessly adopting categories we may not consider all the effects of our choice making  e g  a cat and a cow are both animals  but one we consider livestock which is acceptable for eating 
  discrimination is mindless  langer suggests reducing the categories of people to 'humans' isn't effective for combating discrimination  instead we should mindfully increase the categories so we can find common ground  e g  american man and chinese man are both golfers  changing the frame to golfing provides a bridge for deeper connection and empathy 
  we may seek fewer solutions to problems we face if we mindlessly categorise those problems 
  aging !  sickness  by mindlessly associating aging and sickness we unburden the elderly of responsibility prematurely despite their capabilities and perhaps to their cost 
  to avoid mindlessness   
     focus on process (not outcomes)   focusing on outcomes sets us for negative emotions (e g  only achieving happiness when the outcome is met)  enjoying the process keeps up flexible 
     maintain an open mind   information 'forms' us  holding onto categories prevents us from reforming 
     controlling the context   reframing the context from harmful ones to pleasant growth oriented ones helps our mental health e g  being lockdown at home

maybe you want to drive more sales for your business or get your kids to eat their vegetables?

in the book ""  methods of persuasion  "" by   nick kolenda  , he described this as a 7 step process, which can be remembered by the acronym ""  methods  "" 

 amp  x200b 

1    m  old their perception
2    e  licit congruent attitudes
3    t  rigger social pressure
4    h  abituate your message
5    o  ptimize your message
6    d  rive their momentum
7    s  ustain their compliance

the first 4 steps should be taken before your request, step 5 and 6 is for the request itself, while step 7 is to keep them doing the desired behavior 

so let's get into more detail   

  step 1  mold their perception 

before your request, you'll want to change the lens through which your target sees the world  this can be done in 4 ways 

1  priming  did you know that mentioning words related to being old caused the participants in one study to walk slower when leaving the study? or that showing a picture of a library made students quieter in another study? this works because knowledge is organized in semantic networks, and activating one node, will trigger related nodes 

2  anchoring  how likely are you to share this video? more or less than 90 ?   

if your range for sharing this video was 40 60 , then you likely thought 90  was too much adjusted down to your upper bound of 60  

if i instead had asked whether it was less than 10  than you would have moved up to your lower bound of 40 

3  convey high expectations  this is like anchoring, but just applied to expectations

4  the contrast effect  can you share this post with 50 people? oh    you don't want to?    can you at least upvote then?

applying contrast in this way can make one option appear better because it's seen compared to a worse option!

  step 2  elicit congruent attitudes 

when people's behavior and attitude don't match up they experience cognitive dissonance 

so when you want to ask your friend for  100, then start by asking ""hey, do you mind sparing  10?"", when he says ""yes of course!"" he will get the attitude of being someone who helps you, because that's what his behavior reflected, and he doesn't want cognitive dissonance 

if you then ask  ""hey, do you mind sparring another 100 ?"" then your friend will want to stay congruent with his new attitude of being someone who helps you!

  step 3  trigger social pressure 

here you can use all your social persuasion techniques 

offer them a gum, and they'll want to return the favor, because of the social norm of reciprocity 

reveal any similarities between you and your target to build rapport  even better if the similarity is uncommon, like if you discover you both are huge fans of the children's show ""my little pony""!

mirroring their body language, without them noticing that you are consciously doing it, can also be a great way to build rapport 

and lastly, since most people want to follow social norms, you could take advantage of this  if you are a busking musician on the street, then putting some money in your hat before you start, will make it seem like the norm is to offer you money 

  step 4  habituate your message 

which image do you think you would prefer? an image of what you look like in the mirror, or an image of the way your friends see you?

the mere exposure effect says that people tend to develop a preference for things they encounter often  therefore, it's the most likely that you prefer the way you look in the mirror, while your friends prefer to see you the way they always see you 

take advantage of this by exposing your target to the topic of your request often  if you want to go traveling with your husband, then weeks before asking him you could leave travel brochures around the house and talk about the other times you've been traveling 

  step 5  optimize your message 

the previous 4 steps were all for preparing and now you can finally make your request!

keep in mind that after you've made this request, they'll either evaluate it systematically or mindlessly and you'll need to present your request accordingly 

if they evaluate your request systematically they are more convinced by your arguments 

tell all your best arguments at first and last, because that's what they'll remember the best, but also mention some negative things in the middle to make it more realistic 

if they evaluate your request mindlessly, they are more convinced by other things like aesthetics and the amount of information  if you are making a mindless decision about which toothpaste to buy, then you are more likely to buy the one that lists many benefits and are aesthetically appealing  setting a time constraint or asking people when they are in a good mood can make them more likely to choose in this way 

  step 6  drive their momentum

this step is for sparking some motivation after you've made your request 

imagine you helped your friend move into his new house and he offers you 10   how would you feel? now imagine instead that you received a bottle of wine that you would both be sharing 

in most cases, social incentives like buying a bottle of wine or giving praise are more powerful, because giving money is more likely to shift intrinsic motivation to external motivation 

  step 7  sustain their compliance

if you want your kids to eat vegetables, then you probably don't want it to be a one time event 

to sustain their compliance you could make favorable associations by always playing their favorite songs in the background while they are eating their vegetables

it really really really sucks to have   brain fog     

there are many   possible causes     

 amp  x200b 

  stress
  medical conditions
  medication
  hormonal changes
  lack of sleep

but if you always feel brain fog after certain meals, then it might worth it to test your diet   

within your diet, there could be many possible causes  it could be an allergy, intolerance, overeating, eating the same things or maybe the problem involves refined carbohydrates, processed foods, trans fats, artificial sweeteners, or alcohol 

according to  healthline com ( the elimination diet is the gold standard for identifying allergies and intolerances 

  elimination diet in a nutshell  

essentially the elimination diet is pretty simple   

you   prepare   for it, you   eliminate   certain foods until symptoms disappear, you   reintroduce   them back one at a time and you   evaluate   which foods you think might be triggering your symptoms 

but this doesn't answer the question of which foods to eliminate, if now is the right time and more, so let's get into more detail   

  prepare 

  is now the right time?  

the first phase is preparation

first, you need to ask yourself  is it the right time for an elimination diet?

keep in mind that you need to be able to eliminate certain foods, track your symptoms and everything you eat vigorously, and possibly keep doing this for some weeks  so if you are really busy, traveling or want to eat out a lot, then now might not be the ideal time 

but if you decide that now is the right time, then the first step is to contact your doctor, to rule out other possible causes of your brain fog  if you have an allergy, then the symptoms can potentially be life threatening 

  make a list of foods to avoid   

next, you need to make a list of foods to avoid 

but how do you know which foods to avoid? and how many?

if you don't have any idea about what might be triggering you, then you can either buy a food sensitivity test or spend some time tracking everything you eat, as well as any symptoms that might arise   but keep in mind that while symptoms usually arise within a few hours of eating the trigger food, it could be delayed by up to 48 hours, which would make it very hard to pinpoint 

it's also worthwhile to know the most common triggers 

 amp  x200b 

  for allergies, the big 8 is  milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybean 
  some common food sensitivities are  dairy, wheat, gluten, caffeine, salicylates, histamine, fodmaps, sulfites, fructose, artificial sweeteners, colorings, and flavorings 

and in order to decide how many foods to eliminate, it's important to remember that there might be more than one food that is causing you trouble, and if you just eliminate one of them, then you will still experience symptoms and have to do it all over again 

on the other hand, eliminating too many foods is harder to adhere to, and you are at a bigger risk of creating nutritional deficiencies, which might cause new symptoms to occur  so choosing which foods to avoid is a balancing act 

once you know what to eliminate, write down all things that contain that thing  for example, if gluten is on your list, then write down all things that contain gluten 

  make a list of what to eat instead   

it's also important to make a list of what you are going to eat instead, to make sure you are prepared and aren't going to face any nutritional deficiencies 

  prepare in which order you want to reintroduce foods   

at last, you'll want to make a plan for the order in which you will reintroduce the foods you have eliminated  here you can prioritize starting with the foods you miss the most, the most healthy ones or the one you think are the least likely to cause you trouble 

you can try different forms of the same food separately  for example, trying the white part and the yellow part of an egg separately  it can also be a good idea to try pure forms of your trigger food, like pure wheat if you suspect that might be your trigger 

   elimination 

the next phase is the elimination  here you remove all the foods from your list for 2 4 weeks and write down if you notice any symptoms still occurring  you need to have been completely symptom free for 5 days before moving on to the next phase  if you haven't been symptom free for at least 5 days at the end of the 2 4 weeks, then consider removing other foods and doing 2 4 additional weeks  but be aware that you could have created a nutritional deficiency because of the foods you eliminated 

   reintroduction 

the next phase is the reintroduction  here you reintroduce one food at a time and track any symptoms that might occur  you should wait 3 7 days before introducing a new food since it can take 48 hours for symptoms to occur, and also because you might be able to tolerate some amount of your trigger foods 

if you experience symptoms but are unsure if the food you reintroduced was the trigger, then wait 5 days, until you don't have any symptoms and try reintroducing the food again  but if you reintroduce some food and are certain that the food is the culprit, then wait with introducing the next food until you don't experience any symptoms 

   evaluate 

the last phase is the evaluation  now you should evaluate how certain you feel that you found your trigger foods  if you are uncertain about a few of the foods, then you might run the experiment again with those foods 

also remember that you might be able to handle some amount of your trigger foods, and your sensitivity to foods can change over time 

if you choose to eliminate some foods entirely, then it can be worthwhile to find some replacement foods that make sure you still get all the nutrients you need 

if you want to, you can check out  this animated video ( i made about the elimination diet and brain fog "

working for yourself can be lonely and isolating, now more so than ever  i think spending some time with a team of people that support you professionally, even if you don't work with them, would really help  in the short terms, because of the lockdown, but also in the long run 

the idea is one focused weekly call with 4 6 other professionals who work in a similar field and have similar goals  you each get 10 15 minutes to explain what you do, what your current goals are, and what your current obstacles are  i'll do my best to only match people with others who have similar levels of experience 

the idea is that it will help you stay on track by setting your professional goals and then stay accountable to them through the coming weeks and months  it is also a chance to give and  or receive professional guidance, feedback and support 

i can figure out a form so that people are paired with people in the same field, similar goals and similar levels of experience 

anyone interested?

please leave a comment below or dm me so that i can gauge whether or not it is worth putting something like this together 

any other feedback, or ways the idea could be improved, are most welcome "

0,"why do i feel socially isolated? hey people!

i have a kind of weird problem  i have a pretty decent amount of friends  i have enough people that i could talk with if i have problems  i have quite a big social circle  i have a girlfriend  and i have a good family life 

for some reason though i feel isolated and lonely to a point where i feel almost depressed  it even hurts physically and it distracts me all the time  somehow i cannot identify the problem here 

i have social interactions at least every other day for more than one hour at least  and looking at it from an outside perspective i am definitely not lonely  i am surrounded by friends in my life 

sometimes i think that the problem is that i don't have a lot of connection with them  i rarely ask them if they want to do something so i see my friends maybe once or twice a month  maybe that is part of the reason but it doesn't seem to me that this is everything 

because even when i meet friends and socialize a lot, i feel useless and pathetic when i spent too much time alone  it feels like i am competing in the social game and i feel bad because i am not meeting people  i basically feel like a loser 

the funny thing though is, that whenever i socialize a lot i feel the urge to isolate myself again because i guess i am an ambivert who needs both 

so the point that confuses me is the following  i am not lonely and i have a lot of social contacts  but somehow i still feel isolated  it is not the alone time though, but the feeling of not having upcoming social events in the near future  for example if i know that i will have 10 social events, parties etc  in the next two weeks, i don't mind spending multiple days alone 

my question now is  what are your thoughts? do you think that is is an outside problem and i just need to get out of my comfort zone and ask people more often and schedule more events? or do you think it is more about my inner game and that i am competing and comparing my social life to that of others?"

i've made a video about it here  

or if you prefer reading 

1 set expectations

if aunt sue always complains about all the drama going on in her life, guess what s going to happen when you see her again? she s going to complain about all the drama going on in her life  if uncle george tends to try to guilt trip you because you haven t visited him enough, guess what? he s going to try and guilt trip you  so don t be shocked if a family member does something that you always find annoying  because chances are they haven t changed  so, before we leave the house to visit family, we can prepare out mindset that these things will probably happen so we won t be as caught off guard when they do  so, once your run into aunt sue you can be like    oh yep  that s aunt sue talking about her drama again  or  yep, uncle george is guilt tripping me again  shocker  

2  plan around your triggers

what does your family do that always sets you off? is it when your mom starts treating you like a 5 year old again the moment you step into the house? or is it when your dad turns into a negative nancy when you re all trying to have a nice meal together? knowing what triggers your emotions before spending time with family will help you to create a plan to navigate around those triggering experiences or it can help you avoid them altogether 

3  prepare your responses

we ve all gotten them  we ve all gotten the good ole  awkward, intrusive questions like  when are you getting married?  or  why haven t you lost weight?  or  when are you having kids?  so, what we can do to handle that kind of situation is to make an emergency list of subjects that you can use to change the conversation  or you could even prepare a list of responses for questions you re anticipating  you can try using humor in your responses, like if someone asks when you re getting married you can say  i m really happy right now and in no rush to get married  but feel free to send me money and a gift anyway   or just completely change the subject  i don t really want to talk about getting married, but i would like to talk about how amazing this gravy is  aunt betty what ingredients did you use to make this gravy?  if someone keeps persisting, feel free to excuse yourself from the conversation 

4  ask questions

if someone usually asks you inappropriate questions or if you like to avoid being the center of attention, the best way to get the attention off of yourself is to ask other people questions  this not only gets the attention off of you and on to someone else, but it gives you a chance to connect with a family member and you might even learn something new about them that you may not have known before 

5  don t bring up off limit topics

politics  gossip  death  these are few of many topics that should be off limits, so you don t get into any emotionally fueled arguments or conversations  try sticking with more positive subjects such as what s happening around you in the room, or happy childhood memories, or travel plans, or even favorite tv shows 

6  avoid drama

who knows how to get under your skin more than your family? if you ve got a family member who is trying to push your buttons, don t take the bait  stay cool and don t enter into the drama  because when you don t engage, the drama ends  this could mean you quickly change the conversation or excuse yourself and leave the area if you have to 

7  take breaks

don t feel obligated to stay with your family the whole  entire  time  taking a breather every now and then can help you regroup if you re feeling a bit overwhelmed  you can find another room to chill in or go for a walk  it s ok!

8  put yourself in their shoes

your cousin who s a bit passive aggressive, your sister who is a little controlling, your mom who is a bit critical there s a reason they are the way that they are  something has happened that has caused them to act this way or they re fighting a battle that we know nothing about  maybe your mom lost her parents and it s hard time of year for her  maybe your sister is going through some tough times with her business  maybe your cousin is having a few family problems at home  i guarantee there s more to them than what you are seeing right in that moment  this doesn t excuse their behavior, but it helps you understand why they may be acting in a certain way  showing a bit of empathy can help us look past the rude behavior, not take it personally 

9  look for the good

yeah your family may have annoying habits  yeah there may be family members that drive you crazy  but if we go in focusing on what we dislike about each person, we re not going to have a good time  so let s look for the good in each person  before you get to the family gathering, grab a pen and paper and write down something that you like about each person  focus on that the whole time you re there  because when we focus on the good, it s going to life our mood and we re going to have more of a positive experience 

10  know what you can control

you can t control what people do  you can t control what people say  but you can control how you think, what you do, and what you say  sometimes it s easy to assume our old roles when we step into the house, like reacting when your brother starts teasing you or getting upset when your family picks on your for being the youngest  but you don t have to be that person anymore  you re a grown adult and you get to choose how you respond  show them the leveled up person you ve become 

11  focus on adding value

instead of solely thinking of our family as obstacles to overcome, let s focus on how we can add value into their lives  what is one small action or gesture we can do to add value into someone else s life and make their day better? maybe that s really listening to the story grandma has already told 100 times when everyone else is ignoring her  or maybe that s volunteering to help out with the dishes  when we focus on adding value, it helps us to shift our mindset from  what am i going to get out of this experience?  to  what can i personally do to make someone else s life better today?  when we have this kind of mindset, we have the power to transform each and every moment  even if you don t receive the same kind of gesture back, you are teaching others through your actions how to respect and value other people 

12  change your mindset

you re with your family on this special occasion to have fun   not merely survive  and if our mindset is  i m not going to enjoy this holiday   this is going to be the worst day ever  guess what? we re not going to enjoy the holiday and it s going to be the worst day ever  but if we go in with the mindset of  no matter what, i m going to enjoy this day and the people around me as much as possible  then our brain is going to go in and look for different ways on how to enjoy the day  if something doesn t go right or someone says something that strikes a nerve, remind yourself of that mindset and continue to constantly look for the positives  don t let a bad 5 minutes cause you to have a bad day "

0,"the wisdom of carl jung   introduction  

carl jung was a swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst who founded analytical psychology  he knew sigmund freud, and the two were in correspondence and collaboration for some time on their joint vision of psychology 

his work contained a number of new and interesting ideas that helped to advance the field of psychology, including  individuation, archetypal phenomena, the collective unconscious, the shadow, complexes, synchronicity, and extraversion and introversion 

here are 5 of his quotes, with my interpretation underneath for further clarity and understanding 

 amp  x200b 

 gt  ""everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves "" 

projection, a common defence mechanism, is when we attribute something to another that is really about is  it usually takes the form of unacceptable thoughts and impulses, or an aspect of ourselves that we have previously denied or repressed  if we want to reduce this irritation and gain a deeper understanding our ourselves, we must become aware of our projections and try to discover and resolve the internal conflict that is causing it 

 amp  x200b 

 gt   knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darkness of other people "" 

according to jung, we are best prepared to confront and deal with the malevolent or 'dark side' of others, by first becoming aware of, and taking responsibility for our own  we achieve this through a process known as the integration of the shadow  the shadow represents unconscious material that usually, but not exclusively, contains the  darker  elements of our psyche  the less desirable aspects of one's personality 

 amp  x200b 

 gt      one does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious  (

expanding our awareness, gaining insight, and becoming a more integrated and whole person requires us to courageously face the contents of our unconscious mind, which includes elements of the psyche that have been suppressed  the 'shadow' of the mind contains contents of all the things we do not want to face right now, and therefore, becoming more 'enlightened' is rarely an easy and simple process 

 amp  x200b 

 gt   your visions will become clear only when you can look into your own heart  who looks outside, dreams  who looks inside, awakes   

if we are always looking to the eternal world to discover our true identity, our purpose, our dreams and destiny, then we may be following a script giving to us by others, or we may end up with nothing substantial and worthwhile at all  through self examination and self exploration, we will begin to awaken our true self, and through connecting to our core values and principles, we will have a clearer vision for our life purpose 

 amp  x200b 

 gt   until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate   

how much of our life is determined by the contents of our own mind, much of which we are not aware of, or through external circumstances that are out of our control is not fully known? the higher our self awareness is, through bringing our unconscious thoughts, feelings, and desires into the light of our conscious mind, the less likely they will direct our life without our knowledge  often, what people call fate was of their own making all along, except they were not fully aware of the forces that caused it     see post  finding your life s purpose (

 amp  x200b 

  conclusion  

as you can see, a common theme to jung s quotes and ideas is about understanding our own mind and heart through awareness and integration  the more we understand ourselves, the more conscious and present we become, and the better equipped we will be to understand and deal with the challenges of the world "
0,"the low information diet  a cure for distraction  amp  anxiety realizing that my mind was a mess, constantly distracted and fragmented, i put it on a low information diet  

this involves carefully vetting inputs to ensure that they are of value  i asked honestly whether my consumption of something enhanced or detracted from my quality of life  i noticed that email, for example, consumed a large amount of my attention, while providing little fulfillment in my life  netflix had also captured my attention and held it hostage for hours each week  by tapering off of the potential addiction to information and cutting the  empty calories,   or  useless information, i recovered a sense of ownership over my attention  

i had to rewwire myself from the false belief that more information is always better  most of what i paid attention to, like news soundbites, had no practical value, only serving to distract from what s important in my life 

the low information diet is a direct remedy to information overload  gaining power over my attention through a low information diet not only helped me generate original ideas for my book, but most importantly allowed me to pay better attention to the people and things i care about  the more essential information stopped getting conjoined with useless inputs and lost in the subconscious processor  

i was previously one of the anxious masses that check their phones every few minutes for a hit of dopamine, a pavlovian slave to my device  on a low information diet, i feel like i can effectively harness the information, widely accessible, that  actually matters  to me  that s the beauty of the information age   for those with the mental power it provides endless opportunities for learning and creation  the knowledge economy rewards those who know how to optimize for deep focus, happily missing out on surface level happenings  i recommend the low information diet to all! shamelss plug  i am now trying to spread the low information (somewhat ironically, given that phones are often the source of distraction) through  this mental fitness app ( i am hoping it can get others to similarly begin to   pay attention to where they pay attention   and train a ""fit mind """

if you prefer videos   

if you prefer reading 

1  accept the emotion

we usually see a negative emotion as a bad thing or a weakness  but the emotion itself is a natural part of being human  all it is is a signal from our body that something isn t quite right and that we need to take action and work through it 

because if we don t, then the negative emotion can completely take over and ruin our day 

so, we ve got to accept it, because when we can accept our emotion, then we re in a position to take action and work through it  and part of accepting our emotion means we acknowledge that it s there and we don t judge ourselves for it 

2  make a choice

feeling frustrated is normal, but snapping at someone else  that s a choice  feeling afraid is normal, but not doing something that you want to do is a choice  feeling guilty is normal, but constantly thinking you re a bad person is a choice 

so, regardless of how we feel, we get to choose how we control our thoughts and actions  we can t control negative situations or what someone says or does to us  but   we can be in charge of how we think  and what we do 

so, we can choose to attach to every negative thought that we have and let the negative emotion completely consume us  or we can choose to problem solve through our feelings which leads us to the third tip and that is to

3  create an action plan 

before a negative emotion hits me, i like to be on the offense instead of defense  i want to be ready for when it happens, so i can problem solve through it immediately instead of letting my emotions control me 

so we have to remember that we usually have negative emotions that either rise up in the heat of the moment(like when your kids are arguing and you get instantly frustrated) or the emotions have been lingering for a while (like constantly feeling worthless at your job)

so creating an action plan can help you identify a few strategies to use before you find yourself in an emotional state  before you start snapping at someone because you re angry  before you start guilt tripping yourself about the past again  before you talk yourself out of a job opportunity 

here are 8 examples you can use  

1  identify possible triggers  what is it that usually triggers your emotion? is it when people aren t listening to you? is it after you watch a movie? is it when you hang out with certain friends? identifying what sets you off helps you navigate around triggering experiences or it helps you to prevent them altogether  

2  put yourself in the other person s shoes  if someone makes you upset, instead of taking it as a personal attack, ask  what s happened to this person to make them act that way?  this helps you sympathize with the other person instead of getting instantly emotional  like someone cutting you off in traffic  maybe they re rushing to a family emergency or they have a passenger who is yelling at them or they re late for a major interview because they had a flat tire earlier  

3  breathe  take a breath and say to yourself  i m not going to let this emotion get the best of me   this is going to wake up the decision making part of your brain, so that you can start to gain control  

4  start counting  think nothing but the numbers  make a goal to count to 10  if you have a lot of emotion try counting to 100 instead  you ll notice as you continue to count, your heart rate will start to slow down a bit, and it gives you time to gather your thoughts before taking action  

5  communicate  if someone has upset you, setting a time to communicate with them is one of the best ways to resolve any kind of issues that are causing your negative emotions 

6  call friends and family  when you have a support group around you, it helps you to feel less alone when you re feeling emotional  

7  eat healthy foods and exercise  this is one we hear all the time  numerous studies show eating right and exercising elevates your mood and reduces stress  

8  retrain your brain to think positive thoughts, so you re not attaching to every negative thought that comes your way 

now all of these strategies aren t going to fit into every kind of scenario  some are going to be more effective than others in different kinds of situations  you have to find what works best for you  if you have more to add that have worked well for you, definitely share those in the comments below  the more strategies we can collect, the better "

the idea is to write something every day to help clarify your thoughts and refresh your mind  it's based on the idea of ""morning pages"" from ""the artist's way"" 

there are other writing journal apps out there, but the exercises are the differentiator  the main idea is to ""just write"", but often the hardest part is getting started, so you can simply type a   and get a list of prompts  most are exercises in self improvement  i also put a fair bit of effort into just having a nice editor to work with

and if you've never heard of imposter syndrome, it's essentially when we constantly doubt our accomplishments and we feel that at any moment people are going to call us out as a fraud, despite all the evidence of our achievements 

so, for example someone who recently got a promotion at work, may feel they don t deserve the promotion and believe that everyone s going to find out that they aren t good enough for the position 

or

a student may question if they are smart enough to pass an exam, even though they spent hours studying and normally make pretty good grades 

so, imposter syndrome is very very common  it can strike anywhere to anyone at anytime, and if you do have imposter syndrome, you are not alone!

here's 7 tips to help overcome imposter syndrome 

i've made a video all about it here  

or if you prefer reading 

1  create a fact folder 

and a fact folder is a place where you can store evidence of all of your achievements, so if you have an imposter strike you can refer back to the folder to keep your mind focused on the facts  because it s kinda hard to argue the facts, right? so, this could be

  statements about the trials, the hardships, or hard work that have led to where you are today 

  compliments that people have given you, whether it s been in person or through messages 

  positive reviews if you own an online business 

  awards given or pictures of trophies 

whatever has been an achievement or success put it straight into the folder! and next to each piece of evidence, write how you were able to achieve that  when we define our  how,  it helps us identify the steps we took to achieve our success and it leaves less room for our imposter syndrome to discredit our accomplishments  so, instead of just writing down  i was offered a promotion   write  i was offered a promotion, because i exceeded my targets over and over again, and i was doing tasks that were beyond what i initially agreed to do in my signed contract  

2  write down your success goals

so, when we complete a project or task that was successful, our imposter syndrome sometimes kicks in and we think  yeah, that was ok, but i should have done better   so, when we understand and define what success looks like to us before going into a project or task, then it helps to prevent our minds from thinking we should have done better 

3  set realistic goals

setting goals is completely normal  but when we set unrealistic goals, then it s likely for us to completely avoid whatever it is we want to do, because we become overwhelmed before we even start  and if we attempt the unrealistic goal, then we re more likely to fail because again, it s unrealistic  right? and that can lead to imposter feelings  so, whenever we ve got a massive goal we want to achieve, it s a good idea to take that big huge goal that s causing us intense pressure, and break it down into small, achievable steps that can be measured  for example, if you want to lose 20 lbs, don t give yourself the goal of losing 20 lbs in two weeks  a more realistic and achievable goal would be to lose a pound a week for 20 weeks 

4  own your accomplishments

a lot of times we can discredit ourselves with our achievements  we say  it was no big deal  or  i got very lucky  or we completely give the credit to someone else when we had a major part in everything  so, it s important we be aware of the language we use with others and state the facts, because it reinforces our hard work  so, for example, if someone compliments us on something that took us a lot of time to do, let s simply say  thank you  i put a lot of work into this  instead of  oh it was nothing  

5  have an action plan for mistakes

it s easy for us to feel like a total imposter once we make a mistake  but mistakes are normal  everyone makes them   every person you think is extremely successful  yep, they ve made tons of mistakes  no one is immune  and when we make that one mistake, what does our brain do? oh  it looks at all the accomplishments and achievements we ve had and completely disregards that one mistake  nope  it focuses on that one mistake, despite all of our past success  but, when we understand mistakes are normal and part of our learning and development, then we re able to create an action plan for when they happen instead of dwelling on that one error  so, an example of an action plan could be  make a list that has an equal amount of positives and negatives that happened during the event and write down any improvements that you want to make 

6  know your imposter moments

when do you tend to feel like an imposter? is there a certain time of the day when it strikes? does it happen when you re at work, when you re by yourself at home or when you re out around other people? it s important to be aware of when you experience imposter syndrome, so that you re able to prepare yourself  for example, if you usually have imposter syndrome in the middle of a work meeting, you can prepare your mindset before going into your next work meeting by doing one of the tips above like looking at the achievements in your fact folder 

7  feel the feeling and take action anyway

a lot of times we feel pretty nervous or doubtful before diving into a big project or stepping into a new role  but it s important to remember that these feelings are normal  we all have those feelings, especially when it s something we haven t done before  so when we have a good opportunity in front of us that d we like to pursue and we feel like we re not good enough or feel like we re not ready, we should take action anyway  because there s a reason this opportunity has appeared in your life  it didn t come out of the blue  there s a reason a new role was offered to you or you re about to take on a big project  think about what you had to do in order to get this opportunity  when we take action even if we feel a bit nervous, that means amazing things are about to happen, because we re going to be outside of our comfort zone, which will push us to the next level, which is where all the magic happens  and if we never try, we may always end up regretting it "

i've made a video about it here 

 

 amp  x200b 

or if you prefer reading 

1  step outside of your comfort zone

one reason we may have low self worth is because we don t believe we deserve good things in life  we don t believe we our worthy of a good job  we don t believe we are worthy of a good relationship  we don t believe we are worthy of a good body 

and if we are being honest with ourselves, a lot of times we have these beliefs, because we are afraid  we re afraid when we change something in our life and step outside of our comfort zone that we will fail or others will criticize us or that we will ultimately get hurt  and a lot of those fears most likely come from our past experiences whether you had someone make fun of you, or you were pressured to perform well in school by a parent, or you experienced some major financial hardships or you ve had some sort of trauma 

so, any change we even think about doing, our brain says  hold up! stop  don t even think about doing that because it might hurt you   our brain automatically tries to protect us from the unknown, because it doesn t want us to experience pain 

have you ever gotten the urge to dance at a social event when the music comes on and then your brain says ""nope  stop  people will make fun of you "" or have you had the urge to go talk to someone new and your brain says ""stop  that person s not going to like you  stay away ""

our brain acts like a bodyguard  which isn t a bad thing, because it s doing its job  right? our brain wants us to experience pleasure and not pain 

but it can really get in the way when we want to make a positive change that s actually good for us, so we can get what we deserve in life 

so, how do we break that pattern of the brain automatically saying  nooo  don t do that or you will be in pain! ?

we say  ""thanks brain, appreciate you trying to protect me, but i got it from here "" (like in the movies   when someone rocks up at a super wealthy person s house and a bodyguard appears, gives them a hard time because they re being very protective, and then the wealthy person is like ""thank you alfred, i've got it from here"") 

so when we say  we ve got it from here   we take control of our thoughts instead of letting our minds run the show 

we interrupt our brain pattern of automatically telling us  no  whenever we want to make a change 

and that makes us feel pretty good, right?

because we ve gained control and we re going to tell our brain how we run things around here 

it s when we gain that control, that we can then take one small but courageous step forward towards what we deserve 

we take one step outside of our comfort zone into the direction we want to go  then when we complete one step, we take another step  and another step  and another step  until we reach our ultimate goal and get what we deserve 

and it may feel a bit awkward or scary at first, because we ve been listening to our brain tell us  no  without doing anything about it for a very long time 

but after that first step, i promise you will feel so accomplished and so proud of yourself that you could do that 

and ultimately you deserve happiness  you deserve whatever you want in life  it s all about just taking control of that brain trying to protect you, and letting him know  thanks  but no thanks  this step forward in my life will actually bring me way more happiness than where i m at right now  and i ve got it from here ""

the next way we can increase our self worth is by

2  stop comparing yourself to others

so  many  times  we try to measure up our worth by comparing our life to someone else 

we think 

  they have a better car than me, so i must not be good enough
  they have a smaller waist than me so i m not good enough
  they have more money than me, so i must not be good enough

and it s the biggest lie ever 

do you know the odds of you being alive right now are 1 in 400 trillion? 1 in 400 trillion! do you know the chain of events that had to happen for you to even exist? you have way more of a chance to win the lottery than being alive right now! and we spend our time being alive by comparing ourselves to someone else and not feeling good enough?!

that s not living my friend 

you are so special and so needed in this world  your unique ideas and views are needed in this world  you have a major advantage in life just by being you, because there is not one person on this planet that has seen or experienced the world like you  which means, no one is going to have the same strengths or talents as you 

so, instead of comparing ourselves to others, let s start looking inward and being in tune with ourselves and ask   what actually makes me happy and what makes me feel alive?  and go do that  because you deserve to make the most out of this one life you have  not wasting it  by comparing yourself to others and trying to achieve what they have, because you think that would make you more valuable 

just by being you, you 1 in 400 trillion person, that is valuable enough!  )"

just wanted to share a few things i've learned on teaching people how to treat me with respect 

because it can be so frustrating and disheartening when someone behaves badly towards us and we wish so much that they can see their bad behavior and correct it 

but unfortunately, we can't change anyone's rude behavior, but i want to focus on what we can control   and that is us 

so here are 3 examples of how we can be in control and teach others how to treat us with respect, especially when we find ourselves in awkward and disrespectful situations 

here's a video i made all about it 

 

 amp  x200b 

 amp  x200b 

 amp  x200b 

if you prefer reading 

the first way we can teach others how we want to be treated is to

1  respond don t react

say you re in a good mood, minding your own business  you re watching your fav youtube channel, and then out of no where your significant other, let s call him bob, storms into the room, starts yelling about how enormous the electricity bill is this month  then he starts blaming it on you, because you like to keep your heater on  and he starts calling you names  like stupid and careless

when this happens, what emotions are you feeling? you re probably feeling a variety of emotions  angry that bob stormed in and yelled, confused as to why the bill is so high, guilty because you think you may be the culprit of the high electricity bill, and mostly hurt because bob is being disrespectful 

and you ve got a couple of choices on how to address this situation 

  1  you can choose to react negatively which means you change your good mood and take on the negativity, which now puts you in a bad mood and then you fight back and start yelling at bob and calling him names  or

  2  you can choose to respond positively  which means that you don t engage with his negative actions  instead you calmly say  i understand that you may be feeling frustrated right now, bob  however, i don t want to talk to you when you re yelling at me and calling me names  i find it completely disrespectful  so, i m going to leave the room and when you re a bit more calm, then i ll be more than happy to talk with you 

see the difference  when we choose to react, we take on whatever emotion the other person is feeling and we wear it  our good mood gets ruined and we immediately go into a negative headspace 

but when we respond, we re not going to take on negative emotions  we re not going to allow ourselves to get pushed down to the other person s level  we take control of the situation and distance ourselves from it, so it doesn t affect us at all  when we do this, we teach the other person that we don t accept that kind of behavior towards us 

i like to look at this situation the same as if you were dealing with a toddler throwing a tantrum  because essentially this is what the other person is doing  acting like a toddler  and if a toddler yelled and screamed at you, you wouldn t yell and scream back, right? you would calmly explain what is an acceptable way to talk to you  you don t yell back at them and call them names, because you ve got to role model and show through your actions what is acceptable behavior  that s how they learn  right?

the exact same principle applies to adults  whenever we run into someone who is acting disrespectful towards us, we respond by staying calm and in control of our words and actions, instead of reacting negatively by mimicking the other person s rude behavior 

the next way we teach people how to treat us is to 

2  enforce boundaries

say you ve had one of the most stressful work days of your life and you have a coworker who invites you out to dinner  but you are exhausted and all you can think about is wrapping yourself in a blanket, grabbing your fav snack, and vegging out to your fav netflix show 

so you ve got two choices to make when this kind of situation happens  you say yes to your coworker and spend the rest of the evening probably regretting your decision 

or you can set a boundary and communicate your wants and needs  a boundary is basically understanding what is best for you  emotionally, physically, and mentally  so, in this example, what you may feel is best is to say  no  because you want to rest  so as a response to our coworker we can say  thanks so much for the invite  i won t be able to make it tonight but i hope you have fun  

now, if we say yes, even if we don t want to go we may be the type of person who says yes to everything, regardless of what it is, because we don t want to disappoint anyone or we don t want to be seen as the boring person  the problem with this is that we become the  yes person   people start to know us as the  yes  person, so they think they can ask us to do anything, because we will always agree  why do they do that? because we ve unintentionally taught people that s what we do  if we never stand up for ourselves  if we never say no, then people learn   oh ok, she says yes to everything, so if i ask anything of her, i know she ll do it  

now, if we have the courage to say no, then sometimes we have someone who doesn t respect our boundaries and tries to push us to do something anyway  and usually there s some flattery or guilt thrown in like 

 please it won t be the same without you!  or    just this one time you hardly ever go out  or  you don t want to leave me hanging do you  do these responses sound familiar to you? it s hard to say no when we get these sort of responses, right?

but if we change our response from no to yes then without even realizing, we teach people that they can push our boundaries if they want a certain response from us 

again, this situation reminds me of communicating with a child  if a child asks for a piece of chocolate and you tell them they can t have any then they may throw a tantrum, or use flattery or try to guilt you by saying  you never let us have chocolate  or  pleaseee i ve been so good today  you re the best mom in the whole world 

if you give in and say yes, then that teaches the child that they can push your boundary to get what they want when you say no 

so, whenever we say no, it needs to be firm  whenever we enforce any kind of boundary, we need to be firm with it 

when we do this, we teach people that we respect ourselves and they should do the same 

the next way we teach people how we want to be treated is by 

3  communicate your feelings

say you have a family member who always picks on you about your career  in so many words, they tell you that your job isn t good enough and that you need to make more money  when they do this, it can make you feel angry, upset, or frustrated, because it makes you feel as if you re not good enough even though you love your job 

when this kind of situation arises, whenever a family member picks on you about something, usually two things happen, o you give the silent treatment and avoid this family member like the plague or o you just take it  you sit there  say nothing  and maybe even kinda laugh it off a bit

but when you do those two things, it s not addressing the issue that is at hand which is  when that family member says unkind words to you, it makes you feel worthless  and because you re not communicating with that family member, you re essentially showing them that it s ok to say those things 

so, what we should do instead is communicate our wants and needs with that family member  we should tell them how we feel when they say something that offends us and that we would appreciate it if they stopped 

now some family members are completely oblivious when they say hurtful things to us  they aren t intentionally trying to be mean or hurtful they just have no idea that what they re saying is offensive  and it takes us standing up and communicating with them, so they can realize that their words are actually hurtful  when this happens, they usually feel pretty bad and change their behavior 

other times, you have family members who keep repeating the bad behavior, which at that point, you ll have to set and enforce some boundaries, which may mean that you have communicate to them that you are going to distance yourself until they are able to correct their behavior 

otherwise, if you do nothing, they don t take you seriously and continue with their behavior "

just wanted to share a couple of things that helped me tremendously in starting my day off right  for many years i woke up in a bad mood dreading the day ahead, but now i wake up relaxed and focused  the two things i do are simple, yet extremely effective  hope this post helps others who also have a hard time starting the day off on the right foot!

i've made a video if you'd like to learn more on how i start the day off right   

if you prefer reading 

80  of us are doing something first thing in the morning that is ruining the rest of the day  can you guess what it is?

we check our phones first thing in the morning! and though it may seem harmless, i ll tell you why i ve decided to lose the phone in the morning 

so, when we first wake up most of us, roll over, and before even getting out of bed we reach towards the night stand grab our phone and we check what s happening on social media  when we do this,

we run the risk the of becoming frustrated, annoyed, angry, or stressed because our newsfeed may be 

  filled with pictures of everyone s perfect little lives and our brain could start subconsciously comparing ourselves against them  or

  we ve got sponsored ads trying to sell us something  or

  we can news that is completely negative and it gets you riled up 

and then we could start reading emails and messages from people who are wanting us to do different things for them 

and our mind starts the day off in complete chaos  it s in reactive mode, right? before even getting out of bed, we can start the day off in a negative mindset  you wouldn t happily let 70 people walk into your bedroom when you first wake up, right? so why are we letting them into our lives first thing in the morning on our phone?

we give our energy and attention all day long to other people, so the least we can do is not give away our energy first thing in the morning 

and i was guilty this for such a long time  but now, what i like to do instead, is start the day by being proactive, so that i m in control  instead of starting the day being reactive and letting all of these things consume me 

so, before touching the phone, i spend at least 15 30 minutes working on what i want to do, whether that s writing, reading, going for a walk, listening to music,  whatever it is 

since, i ve adopted this new habit, i noticed that i m not as distracted during the day  i m a lot more calm  i start the day off being productive which carries on to the afternoon  and for once, i m excited to start the morning, instead of dreading it, because i m working on what i want to do which ends up boosting my mood and energy for the day 

losing the phone first thing in the morning has been a game changer in my life! and i highly highly recommend it if your life feels a bit stressful and chaotic right now 

the second self love habit that has changed my life in the morning is when i decided to stop hitting snooze 

so when your alarm goes off and you hit the snooze and you start dozing off again scientific research shows that you trick your body into thinking its going back into a deep sleep  so, when you wake up again after only snoozing for 5, 10, 15 minutes, your brain and body are confused which leads to that groggy feeling you get that lasts for the rest of the day  have you ever had that? it s called sleep inertia  and it is a big energy drainer 

and when you re used to pressing snooze every single day when the alarm goes off, then you re body starts to form a habit so we can hit that snooze without even thinking twice about it 

again  this was another bad habit of mine 

so, what i ve done to help break the habit is i ve changed the alarm sound, because the alarm sound acted as a trigger for me to roll over and turn the snooze on 

so, when i picked a new alarm sound, then that formed a new trigger, so that i could create a new habit to wake up more positive 

and the amazing new habit that i ve implemented is naming 3 things that i m grateful for 

so, now when i hear my new alarm sound, that is my new trigger to turn off the alarm and instantly name 3 reasons for why i m grateful  this starts my day off right because when i think of why i m grateful, it puts me into a positive mindset, my mood is instantly lifted, and i m more in a state of abundance rather than feeling like i m lacking something 

if you want to take this tip to the next level, then you could put your phone somewhere where you cant reach it like across the room or completely outside of the room  this forces you to get up to turn off the alarm, and it breaks that bad habit of reaching over for the phone without thinking 

there s also around 30  of people who check their phone throughout the night, so having that thing away from you will help you not only wake up better but also sleep better "

0,"top 10 habits of a venture capitalist turned entrepreneur this past year i pivoted from a career in venture capital to create a mental health technology company  here are a few of the habits that i've found have helped me get the most out of work and life 

 note  i'm not claiming to be a superhero or tim ferriss, but hoping you might find one or two here to help you as well  

1  only check email and texts 3x daily unless planning something urgent  my phone is often in airplane mode or out of site  my notifications are always silenced  in a world of distraction, attention is our most valuable resource  i guard mine like a bullmastiff  

2  don't schedule any calls or meetings before noon  from the time i wake up until i break my intermittent fast, this time is devoted to deep work, when i can get the most done without cluttering my mind with email and meetings 

3  call or (even better) facetime a distant friend every sunday  this helps maintain relationships and has helped a lot with the often lonely life of an entrepreneur  interpersonal connection is a psychological need that we all have from our evolution as hunter gatherers  yet 47  of americans report that they are lonely  connection matters, and is a key part of mental health, something i used to overlook as an entrepreneur 

4  meditate for at least 15 mins every morning and night  this is non negotiable  i can tell the difference in emotional regulation and focus on days where i've missed the morning session  and i waste a lot of time lying in bed awake if i don't get in the evening session  ray dalio, the most successful hedge fund manager of our time, attributes ""any success he's had"" to meditation  i couldn't agree more  (shameless self plug  my team created a science backed meditation app that i use for these sessions www fitmind co)

5  japanese green tea in the morning  sencha or matcha, is my preference  it's a smooth caffeination, as opposed to coffee and green tea has a lot of proven health benefits  this is a personal preference but has become a favorite part of my routine 

6  take a cold shower every morning  makes the rest of the day easy by mentally preparing me to willingly face discomfort  there are other benefits, like the hermetic effects of cold exposure and a temporary increase in ""happiness chemicals"" like adrenaline  sucks at first, but you get used to it 

7  read 1 hour before bed  the most successful people in the world generally read a ton  warren buffett devours literature  the more you know across different topics, the more you can form novel connections and innovate  i've learned to value learning way more than i ever did while in school  and the best part  i get to read what interests me! (currently reading ken wilber's a brief history of everything, perhaps the greatest philosopher of our time?)

8  workout at least 3x per week  richard branson often talks about how important exercise is in his success as an entrepreneur  despite what trump seems to think (you have a set and limited amount of energy), working out is actually net energy positive  you feel better afterward and paradoxically have more time by increasing productivity 

9  journal my dreams  every morning i write down my dreams  if you think you don't dream, you do (3 5x per night)  anyone can improve their dream recall by setting a strong intention to write them down immediately upon awakening  why is this an important habit for me? your dreams contain important information about your subconscious mind and emotional states that might otherwise escape your conscious knowledge  there's a reason that the greatest psychologists of all time like jung and freud wrote whole books about dreams   they contain a lot of self knowledge 

10  count my blessings  every night i think of at least 3 new things that i'm grateful for  this serves two purposes  1) it makes me grateful in an age when we're constantly being told we don't have enough and 2) it codes my mind to look for grateful things each day (however small) knowing that i'll have to recall 3 new ones that night 

hope you found this helpful and please let me know your own top habits in the comments, as i'm sure that there are some key ones that should've made my top 10 

blessings,
liam"

0,"how to reduce suffering   introduction  

suffering and pain are almost inevitable experiences that we will all face at some point in our lives  whether it is psychological, emotional, physical, or even spiritual, it is unfortunately very likely that we will endure some amount of hardship in one way or another  having said that, there is a great difference between suffering needlessly, like an eternal victim of the negative circumstances of the world, and becoming a triumphant hero who is able to overcome their struggles, by allowing their discomfort to motivate them to become even stronger and wiser 

in religious terms, some consider suffering to be a punishment from god for not living in accordance with his will, whilst others believe the devil to be the true cause of the suffering of humanity  atheists take a more rational approach and believe it to simply be an unfortunate element of existence itself  regardless of whether these beliefs are true or not, suffering is here to stay for the time being, and so we should become more prepared to deal with it by developing resilience, and learning skills to cope more effectively 

causes of suffering range from the mistreatment from others, physical ailments, mental health disorders, trauma, tragedy, spiritual crises, general fears, extreme guilt, shame and self hate 

people respond to suffering in a variety of ways, some of which have led to some of the worst crimes in history, and others have allowed people to transcend their suffering and become greater versions of themselves  other methods include denial, distractions, medication, and various other ways of trying to numb the pain  the following three tips will hopefully give a more mature and healthy way of effectively reducing suffering experienced in our lives 

 amp  x200b 

  tip 1  self compassion  

when you suffer, you should practice having compassion for yourself, which should help mitigate much of the pain that comes with it  if you are being hard on yourself, or you believe that you don t deserve compassion and forgiveness, then a good tip is to imagine you are caring for a close friend, family member, or other loved one 

instead of saying 

  1)    i m a helpless victim 

  2)    i deserves this 

  3)    why did this happen to me 

  4)    i m worthless 

say 

  1)    i choose to be a survivor 

  2)    no one deserves to suffer 

  3)    nothing is personal 

  4)    i am worthy, even though i am imperfect and make mistakes 

this method is particularly useful is you are  beating yourself up  for mistakes and sins that you have made in the past  you should be aware of immoral things that you have done, and aim to change them, but endlessly tormenting yourself isn t helpful and will only make things worse 

 amp  x200b 

  tip 2  meaning  

it was theorised by the psychiatrist viktor frankl, who lived through the holocaust, that one of the best solutions to suffering in life is by searching for meaning in it  he developed logotherapy, which is a therapy based on existential analysis, and focusses on kierkegaard s  will   to   meaning   one of the key principles is that striving to find meaning in our lives, is the most powerful, motivating and driving force in humans 

the three basic principles of logotherapy are as follows 

1  life has meaning under all circumstances, even the most miserable ones 
2  our main motivation for living is our will to find meaning in life 
3  we have freedom to find meaning in what we do, and what we experience, or at least in the stance we take when faced with a situation of unchangeable suffering 

so whatever problems we are facing in our lives, whether we are being haunted by memories of the past, or anticipating fears of the future, we should try to discover and derive some meaning out of it if possible  sometimes the answer we are looking for may be obvious, whereas other times the meaning or purpose may seem elusive, so we will have to try harder to find it 

 amp  x200b 

  tip 3  defence mechanisms  

two people may experience the same problem, the same frustration, the same pain and suffering, yet decide to deal with it in two completely different ways  the brain uses defence mechanisms to deal with unacceptable, or potentially harmful, stimuli and impulses  many of these are classed as immature or even self destructive, whereas some are far more healthy and productive  the following are three recommended mature defence mechanisms that you should learn to use, and incorporate into your life  as opposed to the immature, destructive, and self defeating ones 

  1) altruism      one of the best and most productive ways to feel better about yourself and to distract yourself from pain is to focus on helping others instead  ideas  help to feed or clothe the homeless, join an animal rights group, volunteer in a charity shop of soup kitchen, choose a vocation which is concerned with helping people, donate money to a worthwhile cause  read this article for ideas on random acts of kindness   

  2) sublimation      sublimation means to transform unacceptable impulses into more socially acceptable ones, which are more productive and less harmful  examples include  take up running, cycling, play a sport, try martial arts, exercise, workout, creative expression such as music, writing or painting 

  3) gratitude      perhaps the problem isn t that we are suffering too much  perhaps the problem is that we are not practicing gratitude enough to counterbalance the bad things in life  as often as you can make a mental or physical note of things that you feel grateful for  these could be positive memories from long ago, recent achievements and accomplishments, or any personal development you have noticed

  quotes  

 when another person makes you suffer, it is because he suffers deeply within himself, and his suffering is spilling over  he does not need punishment  he needs help  that's the message he is sending      thich nhat hanh

 amp  x200b 

piers steel is a recognized expert on topics like motivation and   procrastination   and in his book    ""the procrastination equation""    he gives an equation you can use to analyze exactly why you procrastinate 

 amp  x200b 

  but what is procrastination?  

piers steel says that procrastination is a fight between the    prefrontal cortex    and our    limbic system    

considering immediate pleasures like food activates the limbic system while thinking about future benefits activates the prefrontal cortex 

back in the day when our primary job was to hunt, you always had to act according to immediate pleasures and threats and for that reason you could rely on impulses from the limbic system, while today your success in life is highly influenced by your ability to delay gratification and for that reason you have to rely more on your prefrontal cortex for impulse control  unfortunately, we have only partially evolved to the rising demands of self control, through the development and use of the prefrontal cortex 

interestingly, the development of our brains from our time inside the womb, through childhood and adolescence, roughly corresponds to the evolutionary development of the brain  in both cases the prefrontal cortex is one of the last regions to fully develop and even in it's most developed form, we are still wired to procrastinate 

 amp  x200b 

  so how can we stop procrastinating?  

well that's where the   procrastination equation   comes into place 

motivation   (expectancy    value)   (impulsiveness    delay)

this is just a mathematical way of saying that to increase your motivation and thereby decrease your procrastination, you have to increase expectancy and value while decreasing impulsiveness and delay 

but you could also argue that you can formulate it like this 

procrastination   (impulsiveness    delay)   (expectancy    value)

but let's go with the way he presents the equation in his book 

motivation   (expectancy    value)   (impulsiveness    delay)

 amp  x200b 

  expectancy   is a number that represents your confidence in your ability to reach your goal 

the problem is that if you have low expectancy and are afraid of failing, you will not even try and thereby create a self fulfilling prophecy 

to fix this piers steel has 2 recommendations 

1    success spirals    set achievable goals and then your results will create motivation for more effort, which will create new results and so on 
2    vicarious victory    if you read autobiographies, or connect with successful people in other ways, you'll see what's possible through them and thereby raise your expectancy 

but be careful about having too big expectations 

you need just enough optimism to believe the task is possible, but from there on being more optimistic will just make you believe you have to work less and thereby decrease your motivation 

 amp  x200b 

  value   is a number that represents how valuable you perceive the goal to be 

if you want to increase value then piers steel has 4 recommendations 

1    create ""approach goals"" instead of ""avoid goals""    so you should be saying ""i want to be healthy"" instead of ""i don't want to be unhealthy"" 
2    self praise and give yourself rewards     we begin mixing up our goals with the rewards  an example of this is that we associate working with making money and are thereby motivated to work 
3    find work that is intrinsically valuable    this one explains itself
4    remember the bigger picture of what you're doing and why it's important    it's the difference between a bricklayer who sees himself building a wall and a bricklayer who sees himself building a cathedral 

 amp  x200b 

  impulsiveness   is a number that represents our sensitivity to delay 

the more impulsive we are, the less likely we are to delay gratification, and this will, of course, be worse the longer the delay is 

to fix this piers steel has 6 recommendations 

1    remove all temptations    hide the tv remote, close all social media apps and throw out the junk food 
2    be healthy    if you get good sleep, food, and exercise, you will have more willpower to override your impulses and pursue your goals instead 
3    punish yourself if you don't do what you should do   
4    see temptations abstractly    if you want to avoid cookies, you can just think of them as round objects 
5    in your mind, you can pair the image of the desired temptation with something undesirable   
6    get habits into your daily life  , because habits are something you just do no matter what, and the fewer moments of choice, the less you will procrastinate 

 amp  x200b 

  delay   is a number that represents how far away the reward is 

if someone else has decided the date of the final deadline, then the only thing you can do is to create deadlines up to the final deadlines 

but with all this said, it's still important to strike a balance between procrastinating and being too disciplined  many workaholics regret not having more moments of goofing off and many industrious students regret studying through the spring break  but if you are still reading this, then most likely you are procrastinating too much and have to do something about it

some people don't try and build new habits, some people focus on them but don't have a system in place, and some people don't like their system or it takes too much time 

i have spent many hours creating my habit tracker spreadsheet, that i'd like to share with everyone here 

my aim whilst creating it was that it should be quick and easy to use  after all, nobody wants to spend too much time trying to track their habits   because there's not enough benefit, and frankly it's a bit boring 

the tracker will take you under 2 mins a week to fill out, and everything else is done automatically for you  it includes 

  simple summary (when you just want a quick overview of how you've been doing)
  detailed summary (lets you compare individual habits and shows you things like your ""success rate"" or how long you spend on each habit)
  various graphs (if you just want to want to see the data in the summaries displayed visually)
  a ""snapshot"" of your current habits and your targets (also allows you to see whether you have completed each habit today or this week)

we live in a culture that celebrates sleep deprivation and being busy, without knowing whether it's actually bringing results or not  we have so many options that it becomes difficult to say ""no"" and in the end we work hard and not accomplish much 

one thing that made a massive difference for me and my business is to sit down for 5 minutes and plan my day in advance  it doesn't take a massive effort   the recipe is essentially to look at your calendar to know what events will take up your time (and how much time you have left), and then set 2 3 wins for your day  these aren't tasks, but actual things you want to accomplish by the end of the day 

when you take 5m to step back and look at what's important, you do two things

if you built up to running 5 miles a day then missed a week over a boozy vacation, it can be tempting to think you should go for a 5 mile run when you get back home  but, if you break a streak, picking up right where you left off previously will require much more motivation, so it makes it less likely you'll do it, and if you do get out there for the run it will feel harder, elicit aversion, and leave you less likely to continue with your habit in the following days 

you have to rebuild this habit, which benefits from a   kaizen   approach  go back to where you started, give it a few days, then build up again to where you were  you d be surprised how easy it is to get back in the swing of things   and how many more habits you can maintain   if you give yourself a few days to build back up

since doing this i've noticed a shift in my attitude  i feel a lot more focused and content  when i started the journal, i wrote intentions like, ""to meditate for at least 15 minutes"", ""to feel productive,"" or ""to go with the flow "" after a couple weeks my intentions included more goal oriented activities, e g  ""to buy a domain,"" or ""to read"" 

i've done to do lists before, but this feels different  instead of ""getting stuff done"", i'm enjoying the process  and since i've been trying to get in touch with my own needs   rest, security, peace, etc   many of my intentions are simply, ""i intend to have  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ mental state today""  this means i no longer feel ""lazy"" or unproductive, because relaxation and rest are often written in my intentions 

personally, i've enjoyed writing intentions much more than goals or a to do list  it seems that goals can make me feel unsuccessful, depending on whether or not i achieved them  and to do lists are more goal oriented, while intentions are process oriented  and i've decided that enjoying the process of life (instead of waiting to accomplish goals) is something i want to work on

the following areas especially are my cause for concern 

    job      since university, i ve faced a few redundancies and have yet to make the step up in my career  it just feels like i m going through the motions and haven t made the advancements in responsibility and salary that someone who graduated 4 years ago would expect to make  
 
    home      ever since graduating from university, i ve lived at home  i desperately would like to leave but can t make my mind up about renting or buying in london (don t have enough money for the latter)  
 
    friends      don t have a core group of friends who can appreciate me for me, and push me to want to better  i also find it difficult not to compare my situation to friends who  seem  to be doing great in their lives  
 
    partner      never been in a long term relationship and i m scared i won t find the one  i have the perfect picture of my ideal woman but am yet to find her  i don t have an issue of confidence with girls, i just haven t found someone to make a real go of things with  the fear is as time goes by, i ll rush myself into a relationship that is not for me and then end up with a messy situation  i've gone down vicious cycles like downloading dating apps and ashamedly messing around with escorts because of a sense of feeling unwanted   it's depressing!  
 
    money     i only have one income source and am not sure what to do generate multiple sources of income  reflecting on the money i ve saved to date makes me annoyed  to be clear, i ve tried to be creative and think of ways to entrepreneurial but nothing has come of it  
 

i ve tried exercises like visualisation, affirmations, meditating    but nothing has really hit home  my question is what can i do?  what have you done to turn your life around from a perceived rut to one that is blossoming in all areas  should i be tackling the areas above individually? is there one area that i should focus on which could trigger a domino effect for the others?

any suggestions would be appreciated 

thanks!"

 amp  x200b 

 ""to survive, you must try    lest you wish to die"" 

we've all experienced procrastination  in fact, you might be procrastinating as you read this  there are a ton of long term solutions    that are completely viable, by the way    like building better habits and stronger self discipline  but what if you just want to motivate yourself to do something  right now,  right  this second?! 

here's a simple solution  it's a  5 five step process  i created and it has yet to fail me  if you want to do something but have zero motivation then simply follow this process  go through each step sequentially and by the end i promise that you'll be ready to be productive (at the very least it has always worked for me and the few people that i've shared it with )

 amp  x200b 

  1  engage in 10   20 minutes of physical activity

what i mean by this is to do something outside for 10 to 20 minutes (taking a walk, practicing yoga, or playing basketball ) you're prepping your mind for deep focused work by activating your body and soaking up some of that good ol' vitamin d 

  example    i'll play basketball for 10 minutes (nothing extreme or strenuous, just some shooting around ) and then i'll lay out in the sun for another 10 minutes 

 amp  x200b 

  2  environmental declutter

clean your immediate workspace  clear it of all distractions and external stimuli  this includes extraneous notes, books, and other junk  if your desk is in your bedroom then you better make your bed and put away any loose clothes  decluttering your environment will also declutter your mind and make it so the only thing you can physically focus on is your work 

  example    i clean off my desk of  everything , wipe it down, and give the area a quick vacuum 

 amp  x200b 

  3  task prioritization

focus on only one thing at a time  clear your mind of all the things you have to do to complete your task, and get rid of that to do list that also has unrelated tasks on it  put pen to paper and write down the exact, specific  one  thing that you are going to work on  i find that it helps if i take this to the extreme and don't even listen to music or use other external stimuli 

  example    let's say i have to write an essay  this means i have to  perform research, organize my thoughts and get an idea of how i'm going to write, write a rough draft, edit the rough draft, add citations and sources, have someone review the draft, make final changes, and then finally upload it  if i'm just starting, this is a lot to focus on! so i'll literally take pen to paper and write down ""number one  write a rough draft, stream of consciousness style "" and that's  all  i focus on, i don't even think about the other steps until i'm finished with step one   


  4  start imperfectly

commit to doing your task imperfectly  it can be overwhelming to think of the final product and how much work needs to go into your task before it's finished  so realize that you don't need to start perfectly  it's easier to review and improve upon an imperfect product than it is to create a perfect one the first time through 

  example    instead of writing an essay perfectly the first time through i write a rough draft  and the rough draft is very sloppy  i write it in a stream of consciousness style with no thought of proper grammar, paragraphs, or transitions, etc 

 amp  x200b 

  5  schedule evaluation points

set a reminder for 1 hour after you start your task  once that reminder hits take a 5 minute break and evaluate yourself  how are you feeling? what's your motivation level like? and, most importantly, do you want to keep going for another hour, or do you want to stop? surprisingly, the answer is usually always ""yes, i'll keep going for another hour and then evaluate myself again "" simply knowing from the onset that you only have to commit  at most  1 hour takes a lot of the pressure off, and makes it much easier to start 

  example    i evaluate myself after one hour of writing my essay, decide i'll go for another hour, and then return to step 3  i decide that the rough draft is sufficient and move to final edits 

 amp  x200b 

  that's all!

it's a simple process but after i go through the steps i always find myself doing the task i need to do, even if i'm not motivated  if this is new to you then try it out, i think you'll get big results  

you got this! good luck!"

i've also seen,  750words com (   i used to use it, but stopped when prompted to start paying 

my idea is essentially to combine the two ideas, and throw in the facilitation of other habits that can be done via an app or computer 

is there an app or service that already does this? if so, does it do it well? and most importantly, does this sound like something you would find useful?"

 amp  x200b 

  between friends there is no need for justice, but people who are just still need the quality of friendship    it is not only a necessary thing but a splendid one    aristotle  

 amp  x200b 

questions such as ""how do i make friends?"", ""how do i know if he she is a  true  friend?"", and ""should i keep my current friends or are they dragging me down?"" plagued my consciousness and were the source of much anxiety for many years 

thankfully, our good friend aristotle had an interesting take on friendship that presents one possible answer to all these questions  he classified friendship into three separate categories  using these categories we can analyze our own social life and forge friendships that bring    true    happiness 

  1  utility

the friendship of utility  these friendships are based on mutual gain between two parties  for example, a relationship between work associates or business partners generally these friendships do not last long because once the utility is exhausted the friendship will also dissolve 

these friendships are weak, and not genuinely fulfilling 

  2  pleasure or accidental

the pleasure based friendship  these types of friendships have an emotional origin such as similar interests or circumstances 

examples include people in the same college and fans of similar sports teams 

these types of friendships do not last very long because our interests and circumstances usually change over time 

they may be pleasurable, but are not exactly the most fulfilling because they are not based on a deep understanding and appreciation of the other person 

  3  good

the third category is what aristotle calls the friendship of the good  these friendships are based on the mutual appreciation of the virtues that the other person holds dear 

in other words, you've built a genuine relationship with the person that is not based on simple utility or the appreciation of temporary interests  however, keep in mind that these friendships  do  include the benefits of both utility and pleasure based friendships as well 

in a friendship of the good, you truly appreciate that person for who they are, as they do you  these friendships take time and mutual effort to grow, but they are the most long lasting and most genuinely fulfilling 

  that's all

ultimately, all three categories of friendships are valuable in their own right and it just depends on your personal situation and the context 

but, the friendship that matters the most, and the one that is going to bring you the most joy in your life, is ultimately the friendship of the good

0," advice  three practical techniques i used to overcome social anxiety  

 amp  x200b 

   ""    relationships of the heart are the most beneficial thing to any man"" 

 amp  x200b 

hey everyone  i, like many of you, have suffered from social anxiety for a very long time  

i'm not sure exactly why, nor that it really matters, but it just happens that i get excessively nervous, constricted, and scared during social situations 

 or at least i used to    

 amp  x200b 

these are the three techniques that i used to get big results in decreasing my social anxiety over time 

  1  emulate confidence

in other words, emulate the  physical actions  and mannerisms of people who don't have social anxiety  so, if you're out and about, think about what someone who didn't have social anxiety would be doing  what would they look like? what actions would they take? how is their posture? where are they looking? what is their stride like?

the idea is to almost  reverse engineer  your social anxiety  let your body experience what it feels like to have the appearance of confidence  remember,   ""as you think, so shall you become""  

for me, this acted as a sort of priming, so that i acted the part, and then i eventually became the part 

  2  loosen up physically

people who are uncomfortable and nervous are usually more physically rigid and stiff  so you're going to do  the opposite  of this  jump around, move your body from side to side, and shake out your shoulders and hips 

do this as many times as you need to, and  don't worry  about looking foolish  i don't care if it's in the middle of the sidewalk, a party, or a crowded starbucks  you'll be surprised how few people will even notice, and how much better you'll actually feel 

the idea here is to literally  shake out  some of your anxiety  just remember the quote,   ""loose body, loose mind ""  

  3  practice in non consequential situations 

one of the best ways to overcome social anxiety, just like anything else (at least for me), is through  practice and repetitions   

so what do i mean by non consequential situations? a non consequential situation is any daily situation where you can practice your confidence and social skills without any real detriment to you if you appear awkward 

next time you're going through the taco bell drive through, smile and make some small talk with the cashier  drop them a compliment and ask them how their day is going  this sounds stupidly simple but it's effective 

literally every store and every cashier is an opportunity for you to practice being more outgoing, more confident, and more assertive  remember that, especially if your social anxiety is moderate to severe, you have to   start somewhere   

  that's all

these three techniques may not work for everyone, but they certainly helped me chip away at my social anxiety piece by piece  and i'm betting that after a couple of weeks, you'll see big results as well 

hope it helps!  d"

0,"how to overcome fear, my major paradigm shift  ""fears are nothing more than a state of mind""   napoleon hill 

for a long time fear was my dominant emotion  it controlled my thoughts, feelings, and, most importantly, my actions  but, through a series of very  painful  and  disquieting  events i eventually tamed my fear and (for the most part) am no longer plagued by its forbidding effects 

 amp  x200b 

the following points form the basis of my  paradigm shift  

  1  fear  amp  anger

when you're sitting around a campfire and smoke is blowing in your face do you get upset at the smoke? you may get agitated and move to the opposite side of the fire, but you certainly do not become angry with the smoke itself 

in the same way, you cannot become angry with your fear  anger that you are afraid is not only unproductive, but adds fuel to your fear through the replication of negative emotions  becoming angry with your fear is the same as being angry with the smoke while you're standing in its way and pouring gasoline on the fire  this is a mistake i used to make all the time 

when you experience fear, take a deep breath and accept your fear, do not fight it 

  2  fear is a by product

following this analogy, smoke does not appear naturally, on its own, out of thin air  rather, smoke is a by product of combustion  in the same way, fear is a by product of a lack of  experience  and  time  

generally, you're afraid to do something simply because you haven't done that thing or haven't spent enough time doing that thing before  this was a very important realization for me because i used to think that my fear was random and uncontrollable  in actuality it's very controllable because my experiences are something that i have a vast amount of influence over 

  3  experience  amp  time

contrary to popular belief, you do not conquer your fear through false bravado or mind set tricks  they can be useful in the short term, but your fear will eventually return if you rely on them 

the only way that i've found to permanently conquer fear is to gain more experience in and spend more time doing the very thing that i'm afraid of  it's both paradoxical and stupidly simple  the hardest part is just accepting it and moving forward 

  that's all

  overall  , here's my advice for someone who is about to start something new and is experiencing fear 

don't try to conquer your fear beforehand  instead, take a deep breath and push forward  realize that fear is a  by product  of a lack of  experience  and  time , and work to gain that experience as fast as possible  after some time spent doing the thing, you'll come away with a renewed confidence and an obedient rather than oppressive fear 

 amp  x200b

0,"our war is spiritual  our depression is our lives   we re the middle children of history, man  no purpose or place  we have no great war  no great depression  our great war s a spiritual war  our great depression is our lives  we ve all been raised on television to believe that one day we d all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars  but we won t  and we re slowly learning that fact  and we re very, very pissed off  

 amp  x200b 

this is a quote from fight club  a movie so prophetic that i get concerned every time i watch it  concerned because i don t know if a movie can predict future events, or if the movie itself is the catalyst for the emergence of those events 

 amp  x200b 

modern societies seem unable to offer the level of meaning demanded by our complicated nature  we seek and we find and we seek again and we find again  in the end, we rarely discover answers that can truly satisfy our curiosity  the next question is bigger than the last one and the lack of proper explanations creates an intellectual and spiritual void 

 amp  x200b 

this void becomes an extension of our persona and manifests itself in behaviors that connote moral relativism and a deep anger towards our creator 

 amp  x200b 

the more dissatisfaction we experience, the more the void grows bigger 

 amp  x200b 

it grows bigger until it transforms into a merciless pit that will swallow us all 

 amp  x200b 

the dawn of consciousness was either a mistake or a gift 

 amp  x200b 

no one can really tell 

 amp  x200b 

it was a gift because we are now able to be in absolute control of our world and keep extending our control to other areas of our solar system  it was a mistake because we have no idea why we do all that 

 amp  x200b 

the aimless pursuit of goals, dreams, and visions can keep one alive, but it doesn t necessarily make this life pleasurable 

 amp  x200b 

at the end of the day, every mature person realizes that our war is spiritual and that our depression is our lives

0,"how does becoming clear on how you feel helps you breakthrough it? clarity is power in all aspects of our lives and emotions is no different  often our minds play games on us deceiving us to believe that we feel a certain way whereas the reality is something different  

one valuable habit that i developed over years was how to understand and become clear on how i really feel  

when we become clear on our emotions, we have the power to change our actions and behaviors to get the results that we really want in life  

so here are three questions that help you understand how you feel and what you could do to change it  

whenever you re experiencing an unhealthy feeling, ask yourself  

  1  how do i feel?   

this question gives you an opportunity to slow down the roller coaster of emotions that drags you into a down spiral  this also gives you a chance to acknowledge how you feel which is also important in giving your feelings an outlet to avoid suppressing them  

on the first attempt your answer might be something like, i feel angry, or i feel frustrated  

this is how things look like on the surface  now it s time to get to go a bit deeper to figure out what your true feelings are  

  2  how do i really feel?    

our minds need some time to absorb situations and to let things settle in before the mental and emotional fog dissolves and you could see things clearly  this is why you need to ask yourself a question that allows you to better understand your emotions  

so asking yourself how do i really feel encourages you to connect to your heart and this is where the truth really lies  whereas on the surface you could be feeling angry, deep down you could be feeling stuck and unable to make an important decision at work or back home  

if we don t give our emotions a healthy outlet and we keep running away from it, it will shape into a new emotion that causes us pain  

  3  what can i do now to change this?   

i mentioned before that our emotions are signals from our hearts and minds that we need to change something  this is why understanding our emotions is the first step towards changing our actions  

so let s say the you found out that anger is nothing but a new outlet to your frustration of not making the decision you know you have to make  

in this case, you need to dig the real reason why you don t make this decision  fear of the consequences of your decision could be what s keeping you stuck  in this case you could be thinking of strategies and tactics that reduce the risks of your decision  

clarity is the power of understanding and simplifying to take action and move forward  do something different today to get a new result  

hope this helps and feel free to ask any questions

the little decisions we make everyday about when to wake up, what to eat,  what kind of people we welcome in our lives, what kind of ideas we feed our minds are what really shoes our lives  

a decision whether you express how you really feel to your loved ones or whether you continue to hold your emotions prisoned between the walls of your chest  a decision to show up to yourself and do the work that gets you to where you really want to go  a decision to go the extra mile that gets you all the rewards that others won t get

for the past four days we have covered a number of specific steps to guide you on how you can discover the unhealthy emotional pattern that gives you pain, the true reason of your struggle, and what these emotions cost in all areas of your life  

  the four steps that we ve gone through so far are   


  the first    becoming clear on what you want to achieve out of this journey  

  the second    your current mental and emotional situation  

  the third    the obstacle that has been keeping you stuck in that destructive emotion that long 

  the fourth step    th strategy that you ve used so far to meet your emotional needs, and how it s costing you much 


today in our last step we are going to look at how you can come up with a new strategy to meet your emotional need and how your whole life could be changed once you develop this new strategy  

in our previous posts we ve made it abundantly clear that most of the time what we think to be the problem that s causing us the pain is nothing but a symptom for a deeper problem that s causing us the real pain  

more likely the anxiety, and or depression you re challenged by at the moment won t go away by over eating, taking drugs, or killing time in front of tv  but it will definitely go away when you find out what s been causing you the real pain and finding away meet your emotional need  

the way to do this is by asking yourself  

  what could be a healthy alternative to meet my emotional need for love, connection, feeling especial and needed, feeling important, etc  ?   

  what will i gain when i use this healthy alternative instead of my previous destructive behavior?   
  how my life would look like in all areas?  

one of the very first things i did when i wanted to change my life is to be very clear on what will i get out of this all  

for example  

physically  i ve become in the best shape i ve ever been in my life (almost perfect weight and healthy) 

socially  my relationships with my family and friends have never been better 

emotionally  i feel the love, connection, and appreciate of everybody around me  i feel how much they appreciate the new (real) me that s been lost for far too long  

professionally  everyday is a bless and an opportunity for me to give and be the best i could to people i serve at my work  


being very clear on how your life would look once you commit yourself to making this change adds to the momentum that you ve built before  it gives you better reasons to do the work and become the person you know you could be  

you see we could meet our need for love and connection by being depressed or by giving and helping people  we could meet our need to feel important by being harsh and angry or by being open and loving  we could get more money by being liars and crocks or by being genuine and offer real value to others  

there s always an unhealthy and disempowering way to meet our emotional needs, but there s also a another healthy and empowering way to fee how we want as well  

the choice ultimately remains ours  circumstances are nothing but a trigger that carries with it a challenge and an opportunity  our responsibility is to choose which one to pay attention to  

i truly hope that these five steps have given you an opportunity to know more about yourself  people could spend their entire lives without even truly knowing who they were, or what their lives were about  

i genuinely invite you to take a deeper look at your life and see the opportunity in every situation instead of being distracted by problems  i respect whatever difficult circumstances you re facing, but also know that you re bigger than any circumstance that could ever happen  

the minute you make a committed decision to working things out is that minute your whole life could change  there s no shortage of resources once you show up and do the work  

please let me know if you have any questions  i d also love to know if this has inspired you and guided to take a step forward towards a new life and a new you  "

this is a very simple way to finding out who are you and who do you want to be, which is a very essential step when it comes to transforming yourself out of any unhealthy emotions such as anxiety, depression, anger, or overwhelm  these were some of the destructive emotions that challenged me throughout my entire life 
in this post i will be writing about the first step and in the next few posts i will follow up with the other four steps 

  step 1  become clear on the destination  

the first thing i noticed about myself is that i had no sense of direction in my previous life  i ve always been an ambitious person, but didn t know exactly what i wanted to accomplish  as a result of this unclarity i ve spent the majority of my previous life pondering in different directions trying to find my path amongst thousands of traveled roads 

at first i thought i was the only person, or at least among the unfortunate ones, who have absolutely no idea what they want to do with their lives  but i found out that it was the other way around  i was sharing the same boat with the majority of people who had no clue what they want out of their lives  whereas the fortunate minority are the ones who are already designing their dream life 

up till that point my ambition has taken me to amazing places, but i was busy living others  dreams rather than my own  i mentioned in my previous posts that it was my parents dream for me to join medical school  they   and i   have been disappointed when i didn t get the high school grade that qualifies me to study medicine  so the next logical step   that s how it looked like back then   was to go for graduate school and turn to academia as an alternative dream 

the mistake that the majority of us fall in is that we have no clear sense of direction to where we want to go in life  the danger of this is that when we don t plan, we become part of others  plans  the lack of a clear destiny is an easy prescription to an unfulfilled life and probably a miserable one  this applies to everything including the life we want to have, the people we want to become, the relationships we want to build, and the health we eat to enjoy 
the best place to start transforming your life is to become as clear as possible on the results you want to achieve  this means to start with the end in mind  if you want to transform yourself, your relationship, your body, your business, or any other aspect of your life, start with where you want to go 

so go ahead, bring a pen and paper, set down in a quiet place and answer the following questions 

  where do you want to go?  

  in three years from now, where do you want to be?  

  what kind of person do you want to become?  

  what kind of life do you want to have?  

  what kind of relationship do you want to be part of?  

if you re not sure what do you want in your life yet, it s ok we ve all been there and no need to judge yourself for it  one of the keys to moving forward is to make things as simple as possible to do  often we have great goals, and a lot of energy, but then we end up doing nothing because we get caught up in the details and the complexity of execution  so this time make it nice and simple 

start with what you already know and build on it  this is particularly a good strategy when you don t have the pieces of the puzzle together yet 

one more tip that helped me a lot in laying down the foundation to my new life is to use other people as a resource  in other words if there s anybody you look up to, think about 
what do you like about them? their personalties? relationships? life?
what would you like to have from their personalties? relationships? life?
for example, you like somebody s self confidence, decisiveness, commitment, communication skills, etc  you might like a couple s playfulness, deep sense of connection, mutual respect, trust, good familial ties, etc   (you get the idea)

write these things down and please note that the intention of looking at other people s lives isn t out of envy, but it s a way to have a compass that helps guide you to your destination 

keep working on this list until you re happy with the list you came up with  try to
 get this done in one or two sessions because if you take any longer, you might start to procrastinate (again)

  (insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results)    

a quick recap on the three steps we ve gone through so far  

first step  becoming clear on what you want to achieve out of this journey  
second step  your current mental and emotional situation  

yesterday we finished the third essential step pf finding out what s the obstacle that s really holding you back from achieving the results you want  that could be a belief that you adopted over the years as a result of your misinterpretation of past experiences 

now that we have our hands on the real cause of the pain, we will begin to look at what strategies have you been using to distract yourself from facing the real problem  this is what we do to meet our need instead of working out the real problem  

you can find this out by asking yourself the following  

  what have been i been doing so far to feel loved, appreciated, needed, excited  , etc (whatever emotional need you found out you focus on the most from previous steps)  

for example, somebody might have decided to meet the emotional need for love and connection by staying depressed most of the time  this way people could sympathize, offer love and help  another person decides to escape the pain of not being able to love and be loved by doing drugs or over eating  a third chooses anger to feel important and have others comply to her or him  

then ask yourself  

  what has this destructive behavior (current strategy) cost me in all areas of my life   (physically, emotionally, mentally, financially, and socially)? 

you see what really got me to change and get out of depression, anxiety, and anger was that i realized that their cost was way more than their benefit  here are some things it cost me in my past life  

1  physically  i was at the lowest point of my weight (38 kg 83 lbs), weak, exhausted, very low energy, get sick most of the time 
2  emotionally  easily provoked, angry, irritated, frustrated, impatient, sad, unable to love or give to anybody including myself
3  mentally  unable to focus, low productivity at work (actually i didn t even go to work most of the time), no creativity, foggy  
4  financially  too many absent days (cuts off my cheque), low productive and for performance delayed my promotion and higher salary
5  socially  my relationships were all over the place with my family, my then fiancee, and my friends  low quality relationships, no genuine love, caring, and connection  even when i was present, they felt like i was absent  

the key here is to be as detailed as possible in your description of how this destructive behavior is slowly tearing down your life  this will create momentum and give you the energy to commit to taking action  

tomorrow, in our final step, we will be looking at how to come up with an empowering alternative to this destructive behavior to meet your emotional needs in a healthy and empowering way

i have been trying for awhile now to practice mindfulness and, really, potentiate conscientiousness  less regarding minor anxieties, but rather being truly present 

however, i have recently really noticed that i seem to always hold tension in my face and, specifically, my shoulders  for some odd reason,  though, i have always subconsciously felt   tense  maybe not tense   uncomfortable may be a more appropriate word? i don t know   my personality is generally easy going, (good coping mechanisms, however, occasionally uncomfortable in interpersonal relations   which i truly believe everyone feels to some extent) 

i used to never noticed this or even have thoughts of any level of self critique (or other critique for that matter!) in such an analytical way  i was always an extrovert, and i m curious if there is any level of correlation between sensibility and how such senses of acknowledgment come to reason  

off tangent   but anyway, i often notice myself seeing feeling said tension  for those of you who have worked toward greater mindfulness or self improvement, has this ever been experienced and what are your tactics in controlling and overcoming?

0,"step 3 to figuring things out  what s holding you back 

in the past two posts we ve become clear on two essential steps in our journey to transform out of anxiety and depression  

the first  becoming clear on what you want to achieve out of this journey  
the second  your current mental and emotional situation  

today our third step is to find out what s holding you back from achieving the result you re after  so let s explore what obstacle(s) are holding you back from getting what you want 

when we re faced with a mental and emotional challenge such as anxiety or depression, we think that this is the problem we have to handle  whereas most of the time this is just a cover up for the real issue that needs to be dealt with  i know that so many people get so much attached to the labels of different kinds of anxiety or depression which makes the issue sound like a physiological problem, but if you continue to dig deep behind all of that, it will come back to a different problem than the one on the surface  

here s how you could discover the root of your pain, the real reason that holds you back from getting the result you re after  

  disempowering beliefs  

after we have a number of experiences in life, we start to organize the results of these experiences into an emotional idea  this emotional idea, which we call a belief in turn guides many of our decisions and actions unconsciously  the issue is that gradually these beliefs could become a hinderance towards what we think we re capable and incapable of doing and achieving  

for example, a lady or a guy who seeks a love relationship but things don t work out a couple of times  this person could adopt a belief that s he is unworthy of love because s he gets rejected or left behind  as a result this person might never seek a true loving relationship to avoid rejection altogether  s he continues to think about that and becomes depressed or anxious because s he functions from a mental and emotional state of  i m unworthy of true love   

in this case depression or anxiety is nothing but a symptom to a deeper problem this person needs to make the distinction that s he doesn t have a fulfilling relationship yet because s he hasn t found the right strategy, and not because s he is  unworthy   the minute this distinction is crystal clear, everything changes  

here s how you can find out what disempowering beliefs guide your decisions, feelings, and actions  ask yourself  

  1  what do i believe about myself this situation this person? (this depends on the situation you re in and the result you re after) (for example, if you re depressed, you could have a belief that you re pathetic, worthless, or you ll spend the rest of your life alone)  

  2  what makes you think that? (for example, if you think you re worthless, what makes you think that? what happened that got you to develop this belief about yourself? did somebody tell you you re worthless? did you have a number of relationships the ended not so well? in other words what was the first point in time that got you to come up with this conclusion? (this is one of the most essential parts because this is mostly where the real issue lies)  

  3  what do you get out of indulging in this unhealthy emotion and thought? do you use this emotional pattern of sadness, anger, indifference, overwhelm to distract yourself from making a bigger decision that you re scared of making? do you use depression to get other people s attention? do you get anxious  and stressed to feel important and to have others listen to you? do you use drugs to forget how lonely you are? do you eat to have a sense of achievement that you don t get at work?    

 you see too often we keep complaining about destructive emotions and how much of a problem they are  we try to get over them and get rid of them  but deep inside we re actually using them as a shield to protect us form facing our fear  the moment we become aware of the dangerous game we re playing against our own good, this is the time we could have the advantage of making a decision and taking action to turn things around  

tomorrow, we ll look at your current strategies for overcoming these destructive emotions and how effective you ve been so far

i developed an app based on carl jung's concept of the 'shadow' (i e  the deeply ingrained negative patterns in your automatic thoughts ) it's available for free for the next 7 days on the android play store  

i have been using it on myself for the past few months and it has helped me become more self aware and psychologically disciplined  this is my first app and i'd love to get your thoughts and feedback on it  )

the app is called ""ievolve   defeat the darkness within"" (long and vague title, i know ) it is basically an objective based app, which sends reminder notifications with response buttons, which feed a line graph on the status page, giving the user the ability to track 'violations' of their objective 

the introduction page provides the user with the basic concept of the 'shadow ' the user can select one of the 3 preset objectives, or define their own custom objective  the preset objectives (negative traits) are bitterness, arrogance and greed  the objective pages provide brief description of each objective trait  once activated, the app sends notifications (which can be customized in settings) reminding the user to monitor their automatic thoughts for 'violations' and providing the ability to track 'violations' of the objective on the status page via a line graph 

here's a feature video showing how it works  

personally, i have found that during times of vulnerability or high stress, my 'shadow' tends to pop out and take control of my thought process  i have certain negative tendencies which are ingrained very deeply into my psyche and last year i discovered them, after i became familiar with jung's concept of the 'shadow ' the purpose of this app is to help myself (and hopefully others) become more aware of the 'shadow' and begin to integrate it methodically 

hope it helps  ) please let me know what you think  thank you "
0,"step 2 to figuring things out  your current state of being 
yesterday we took the first step in the journey to finding your true self and transforming your life out of anxiety and depression  the first step was to become clear on the destination that you have for yourself, your life, your relationship, or any other area you want to change  

today we will be looking at our current situation in life  this makes it clear on where we are and where we want to head towards  

today s step is exploring and understanding your current state of being  our state of being is the mental, emotional, and physical condition we have ourselves in  in life we experience a number of emotional, mental, and physical states  this could be healthy states such as excitement, enthusiasm, curiosity, love, and joy  it could also be unhealthy states such as depression, anxiety, stress, anger, fear, overwhelm  

however for the majority of us we have a couple or a handful of states that create repeated patterns which we experience weekly or daily  the importance of these patterns is that after some time they form an unconscious operating system that directs the majority of our decisions and actions  so when we become aware of these patterns and understand them, we could have the ability to change our behaviors and to produce the results we re after  

let s assume that someone is challenged with anxiety and depression  the result s he wants to achieve from yesterday s step (this is the answer to the question of where do they want to go from yesterday s exercise) is to feel joy, love, and passion in their lives  the next step for this person is to find out more about her his current pattern of emotions  in order to find this out, you could ask yourself the following questions  

  1  how do i feel everyday every week?  

  2  what are the set of emotions i experience on a given day week (the most frequent ones)? (e g  anger, sadness, overwhelm, anxious)   

  3  what do i think about when i m experiencing these emotions? (e g  the amount of work i have to do, past unsuccessful relationships or experiences)  

  4  what do i tell myself when i m experiencing these emotions? (e g   i ll never be able to finish this work on time ,  i ve never had a successful relationship ,  nobody likes me ,  i m pathetic ,  i m lonely and i ll probably be lonely for the rest of my life   
 
  5  how does your body translate this emotion? how do you breathe? how do you move? how do you walk? what s your tone of voice?   

write the answers to these questions down and keep them safe long with the answers to yesterday s answers  

now you have two blocks of valuable information  the first is your end destination and the second is where you are at the moment  

tomorrow we ll look into what s holding you back from getting to your destination until now   "

for the past nine months, i ve been living in a time loop  when she broke up with me, i tumbled down a rabbit hole of bipolar disorder  at the time, i was halfway through rehab from surgery i had received for a torn acl and menisci in my left knee  having restricted mobility that limited my physical activity was detrimental to my mental health because i ve always used sports as a coping mechanism  not knowing what to do, i closed myself off and allowed my emotions to build  when i couldn t hold them in any longer, i d hit myself to release the stress that had built up  it was a really confusing span of time for me because my mood was the victim of sporadic changes that i didn t understand  one second, i d be laughing with friends, and literally five seconds later, my mind would wander to the past and fill my head with spite and i d have this dying urge to hit myself in the head 
 
being bipolar really screwed with my life because it held me back from doing a lot of the things that i wanted to  there were times when i felt an intense desire to stop breathing, times when i aggressively lashed out at others because they said something that made me irrationally angry, times when i experienced extreme lethargic episodes laying in bed not doing anything, followed by all nighters typing madly away on my keyboard trying to get assignments done hours before they were due  there was one morning, around three on a school day when my parents had to drive me to the er because i was having a panic attack struggled to breathe, experienced chest pains, lost mobility and seriously thought it was a heart attack  i felt okay by the time we arrived at the hospital  i felt ridiculously ashamed when the doctor told me i was physically healthy and instead directed me to talk with one of their mental health support workers  simply put, i was disgusted with myself  disgusted with the monster that bipolar disorder had turned me into  the reason i describe bipolar disorder as living in a time loop is because there were so many times these past nine months when i genuinely felt like my mental health was improving  but each time i felt improvement, i d relapse back into another spiral of undesirable emotions  the worst part is, i think there was a point in time when i stopped trying to resist the mood swings, a point when i gave up  a point when i gave up, and started using my condition as an excuse  an excuse for my work ethic, for my deteriorating academic performance, for the way i treated the people around me 
 
and that was wrong 
 
i realized this past week that drowning in my own self pity wasn t going to get me anywhere  i had refused to open up to other people and i had refused to listen to the people who tried reaching out to me so it was up to me to get on my feet again and turn my life around  the things that helped me 
 
1) one of my teachers recently showed us a documentary titled  touching the void   if you re searching for some motivation, i would really recommend watching it   my surgeon had warned me against running to delay the effects of osteoarthritis in my knee, and this documentary made me feel ridiculous for being so willing to sacrifice something i love simply because someone else told me to  so instead of indulging myself in misery, i was inspired to get up on my feet again (participating in runs!) and if you d like to read a bit more of my story and support a great cause, give this a read   i decided to start the campaign because it s rewarding to know that you re making a difference in the lives of people who have it so much worse than you 
 
2) i bit my lip and listened to the people trying to help me  my dad had been on me for being  lazy   each time he lectured me, i would retort that he didn t understand my situation  and of course he didn t, because i had refused to open up about what i was going through  when i finally accepted that i was merely using my mental health as an excuse for my poor work habits, i became more aware of my actions, and sought proactive change  sometimes, other people see things in our behaviour that we re oblivious to  it s good to stop talking and listen every once in a while 
 
3) accept that the past is the past, and move on  if your mind wanders to the past because you re constantly reminded of it by things you see on social media, cut off contact  it s difficult, but life moves on with or without you 
 
4) write down small goals at the beginning of each day or the night before in a journal  take on bullet journaling if you re into that, or simply jot down a to do list  at the end of the day, take a look at how much you ve accomplished  keep a record of your lists and observe your progress  if you find that you re not getting anything done, maybe your goals are too ambitious  start with baby steps  stick to a schedule for a few weeks, and you ll have developed great habits  i m still struggling with my own time management, but it s a goal we can work towards together! if you watch the documentary i linked in the first tip, you ll recall that joe uses time pressure to motivate himself  if you set a timer for your work periods and breaks and discipline yourself to abide to those pre determined time intervals, you ll be more productive 
 
5) do something everyday that you enjoy and makes you feel accomplished  for me, that s being active, and i find that taking a bit of time out everyday to workout or even just stretch does wonders 
 
so for nine months, i was caught in a cycle of self doubt, self hate, and general negativity towards myself  you need to be the person lifting yourself up so i challenge you to change the way you talk to yourself  positive self talk only! it wasn t until last week that i really started seeing myself recover from my mental struggles and it took a full nine months, and i'm still not 100  there, but the finish line is in sight  you don t see it, but you re constantly working towards recovery everyday  for every step back you take because you relapsed, hold yourself accountable and take two steps forward  recovery s kind of like an iceberg  you re stuck at the surface for the majority of the ride, but one day you ll wake up realizing that you re able to hold your breath for long enough as a result of all the months you ve been working towards self improvement  that s when you get to dive into the water and embrace the entirety of your recovery  good luck!"

0,"the first step i took to figuring myself and my life out 

the journey to the safe shores of my true self wasn t an easy one, but i enjoyed it and more importantly i learned a lot  so i decided to write this post to anybody who wants to go on the same path, but isn t sure where to start   

this is a very simple way to finding out who are you and who do you want to be, which is a very essential step when it comes to transforming yourself out of any unhealthy emotions such as anxiety, depression, anger, or overwhelm  these were some of the destructive emotions that challenged me throughout my entire life  

in this post i will be writing about the first step and in the next few posts i will follow up with the other four steps 

  step 1  become clear on the destination   

the first thing i noticed about myself is that i had no sense of direction in my previous life  i ve always been an ambitious person, but didn t know exactly what i wanted to accomplish  as a result of this unclarity i ve spent the majority of my previous life pondering in different directions trying to find my path amongst thousands of traveled roads  

at first i thought i was the only person, or at least among the unfortunate ones, who have absolutely no idea what they want to do with their lives  but i found out that it was the other way around  i was sharing the same boat with the majority of people who had no clue what they want out of their lives  whereas the fortunate minority are the ones who are already designing their dream life  

up till that point my ambition has taken me to amazing places, but i was busy living others  dreams rather than my own  i mentioned in my previous posts that it was my parents dream for me to join medical school  they   and i   have been disappointed when i didn t get the high school grade that qualifies me to study medicine  so the next logical step   that s how it looked like back then   was to go for graduate school and turn to academia as an alternative dream  

the mistake that the majority of us fall in is that we have no clear sense of direction to where we want to go in life  the danger of this is that when we don t plan, we become part of others  plans  the lack of a clear destiny is an easy prescription to an unfulfilled life and probably a miserable one  this applies to everything including the life we want to have, the people we want to become, the relationships we want to build, and the health we eat to enjoy  

the best place to start transforming your life is to become as clear as possible on the results you want to achieve  this means to start with the end in mind  if you want to transform yourself, your relationship, your body, your business, or any other aspect of your life, start with where you want to go  

so go ahead, bring a pen and paper, set down in a quiet place and answer the following questions  

  where do you want to go?   

  in three years from now, where do you want to be?   

  what kind of person do you want to become?  

   what kind of life do you want to have?   

  what kind of relationship do you want to be part of?   


if you re not sure what do you want in your life yet, it s ok we ve all been there and no need to judge yourself for it  one of the keys to moving forward is to make things as simple as possible to do  often we have great goals, and a lot of energy, but then we end up doing nothing because we get caught up in the details and the complexity of execution  so this time make it nice and simple  

start with what you already know and build on it  this is particularly a good strategy when you don t have the pieces of the puzzle together yet  

one more tip that helped me a lot in laying down the foundation to my new life is to use other people as a resource  in other words if there s anybody you look up to, think about  

  what do you like about them? their personalties? relationships? life?   

  what would you like to have from their personalties? relationships? life?   


for example, you like somebody s self confidence, decisiveness, commitment, communication skills, etc  
you might like a couple s playfulness, deep sense of connection, mutual respect, trust, good familial ties, etc   (you get the idea) 

write these things down and please note that the intention of looking at other people s lives isn t out of envy, but it s a way to have a compass that helps guide you to your destination  

keep working on this list until you re happy with the list you came up with  try to get this done in one or two sessions because if you take any longer, you might start to procrastinate (again)  

you just finished the first and the most essential step in designing a fluffing life that you fall in love with everyday  

tomorrow we ll work on the second step towards figuring yourself and your life out, which is  current state of being

0,"is life a dream? the other day i was in a field with two close family members having a chat under the sun  it was a beautiful spring afternoon and we were debating the idea of aliens  when all of the sudden i remembered something, i recalled that i was actually sleeping and this was all a dream  the moment i did so i looked closely at the fabric on my clothes, the feeling of the breeze running through my hair  it was all too real  but my two cousins were agreeing with me,  you should go  they said,  you ve got a life to live   i got a rush of excitement, a nice afternoon turned lucid dream and i began flying around like superman  then i woke up, in what we call  the real world   that entire morning i spent contemplating life, is this real? the dream almost seemed more real than this  who am i really? why am i here? what is life? is this like inception? a never ending cycle of dreams?


this all seems extremely philosophical but it gets good  now i thought to myself, the only thing that remains is my consciousness  it doesn t matter what s real or not, i m conscious! in my dream i was conscious and in this  reality  i m just that, conscious! so i thought of an interesting way to look at life  by seeing life this way you banish fear, anxiety, stress and many other awful mental conditions that seem to plague our society 


think of your life, like a dream  if you were in bed at night dreaming and you were conscious of the fact that nothing was real and you would wake up soon, would you ever be embarrassed? could you be stressed? would you beat yourself up for mistakes you ve made?


the great saint in india, muktananda, was asked,  what is real?  he replied,  what is real is that which never changes   your consciousness! the silent observer in the back of your head that just sees everything take place, whether it be in a dream or in what we call real life  wayne uses the lovely example of your body, and how every cell in your body changes every 7 years  meaning the 12 year old me was made up of completely different stuff than the now present 19 year old me  but i remain  the silent observer just witnessing everything 


that is the true self  in our culture we are taught to identify with our bodies, our career, our talents, our accomplishments  jim carrey calls depression  trying to keep up an image in the world   whether it s a self image or a reputation with others, we try so hard to be someone we are not  if you are the car you drive, and some steals it, than you become  nobody   if you identify with your smooth complexion than the moment wrinkles start to set in you lose your identity 


the ego is nothing but an idea in our minds of who we are and who we should be  when deep down you have a calling, a purpose to create something powerful  regardless of how good in looks in the eyes of others  think of life as a dream  don t take things so seriously  of course there are others in this dream, they have their own purpose, there are consequences to everything  to dedicate your life to the ego will lead you down a path of disappointment and sorrow 


how do we get rid of the ego? simple, live your life in service of others  put your own worldly pleasure and reputation aside and do something for someone else  i will leave with this second half the peace prayer of saint francis 


o divine master, grant that i may not so much seek
to be consoled as to console,
to be understood as to understand,
to be loved as to love 
for it is in giving that we receive, 
it is in pardoning that we are pardoned, 
and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life

however, how can you choose the books that will be helpful to you? here s how 

  1  choose a relevant topic  

if you want to build a business, don t read about poetry  this one is pretty obvious but i just wanted to point it out just in case 

to do   choose a topic that s relevant to what you want to learn

  2  check the reviews  

if you want to read a book, it s most likely that the people who have already read it were lookng for similar information  what does this mean ? it means that if they liked it, you probably will 
this is why you should check the reviews, to see if that book has helped the people who have a similar issue  of course this is not a foolproof metric, but in most cases, it will reveal if the book is any good 
where to find the reviews ? the best sites are amazon and goodreads 

to do   before reading a book, check the reviews 

  3  check the author  
reasearch the person who wrote the book  read a little bit about his biography and career  this can give you an idea of how credible the author, and therefore the book is 

to do   before reading a book, research the author 

  4  consider who s recommending the book  

i got this one from valuetainement (great channel for entrepreneurs by the way)  sometimes people tell you to read a certain book  it can be a friend, a familly member, and even an influence on youtube or on a blog 
when you see someone recommending a book for you, consider wether or not that person knows what he she s talking about  if you see that person as a credible source, why not accept the recommendation ?
i have personally read some books that were pretty long just because someone i trust recommended it 

to do   read the book if it s recommended by someone who s credible 

that s how you can choose what books to read  i do this for most of the books that i read, and till now, most of them were pretty good 

this isn t a foolproof tactic but it will definitely help you choose the best books for you "

0,"the confidence paradox we all know at least one or two people who carry a vibe that is so attractive and fun to be around  we know this because when we meet these people they make us feel comfortable, they make us laugh, they keep things interesting  they re enthusiastic and charismatic  i m talking about confidence  but not the big ego pride that some people have where they do nothing but brag and talk down to people  real genuine confidence  i have an interesting way of looking at confidence, especially coming from a guy who has dealt with shyness, social anxiety and insecurity his entire life  i ve had my fair share of embarrassing moments and self doubt  but recently i have been able to completely eliminate nearly all fear and replace it with unwavering courage and confidence in my self  i achieved this personal transformation in a seemingly counter intuitive way  just keep in mind we are not the human bodies and persona s we are constantly being judged by and judging  we are so much more 

  

1   do not pick and choose
i stopped caring about the good things people thought about me  i basically gave up on both ends of the spectrum, good and bad  here s the thing, when you say to yourself,  i don t care what others think when it s bad cause they re just stupid anyways, but i looove when people compliment me and appreciate me  you are inviting a world of problems  think of this way  i want to catch shrimp with my big net in the bottom of the sea, i m going to have to grab everything that s down there  including plants fish, mud, rocks etc  meaning  if you care about the good you must care about the bad as well  when you care about opinions there s no way to filter out a certain kind of opinion anymore than there is a way you can filter only shrimp when you drag your net through the water  you re gonna catch whatever is in there  the ego is a package deal  so stop caring all the together  don t let the good get to your head anymore than the bad  let people think what they want to think  try your best to view the good as equal to the bad  they re all simply opinions at the end of the day  whether they are good or bad is a human construct  we see a counter top where we prepare our food, and our cat sees a lovely bed they can lay on  everything in this world is subjective  so stop caring and you find an amazing sense of freedom and release of tension  you ll be yourself because there s no more need to impress or convince 

  

2   stop trying 
confident individuals don t try, they go with the flow, they follow their heart  they do what their heart guides them to do  they have lost their ego and so bliss and flow is their natural response to life, and that is what we strive for! consciously or subconsciously we want to live a life free from concern, acting without fear, we want happiness, we want confidence and courage  but we try too hard  i believe there is a constant flow of good energy, happiness, confidence and love but we create resistance but chasing after these things  

for example, imagine you re at a market and you see an attractive guy or girl  the thought of approaching them and trying to talk makes you super nervous  you re friends bugs you so much to the point that your finally talk to them  as you approaching you re trying really hard not to be nervous  you re focusing heavily on not looking nervous and appearing confident  you say hello, they notice how much you re sweating and shaling  with fear for their life they ignore you and speed walk away  

if you would have simply not cared about the outcome  not cared whether or not they thought you were attractive or cool  if you would have not cared even what language they speak  if you would have just been your true self, and not put this person on such a pedestal, you would have paradoxically appeared more interesting, confident and attractive  

i actually learned recently to just be myself when i make humbowl videos as an example  i used to try real hard to put my thoughts into words that people understand, and as a result it would appear disingenuous  once i relaxed and let myself mess up, let myself ramble on and speak the  language  of my mind rather than try to filter it into generalized concepts for everyone  i appear more confident  like i m having more fun, and paradoxically, people understand me more!

so quit trying to be happy and you ll find happiness  quit caring about what others think, and chances are you ll feel much more comfortable in your own skin and in turn become much more confident  confidence is easy, it s natural

0,"10 useful life lessons to give you a head start   1  experience without deep analysis is useless  

i ve seen a lot of people who have plenty of experience  they ve been to a lot of places, talked to tons of people, worked at many jobs, yet their level of thinking didn t change at all  why ? because despite their experience, they never took the time to make conclusions from their trials and errors 
if you compare someone who learned a lot of stuff just out of awareness, and someone who s had plenty of experience but who lacks the proper thinking, the first one will easily be more successful in life just because the first one will avoid the mistakes even if he never experienced them, whereas the second one will keep making the same mistake because he won t get the lesson behind it 

  2  don t trust people too quickly  

i think you already know this, so just take it as a reminder  a lot of people make the mistake of trusting too fast, opening up way too quickly than they should  well, i think the lesson is pretty obvious here, don t do that 

  3  if you wait for something to be happy you never will be  

i ll be really happy when ____ fill in the blank  this is a huge mistake that most people, including me, make at some point in life  there s this illusion the somehow, a person, an event or a material possession will suddenly make us happy 
let s pretend it s true for a moment, how long do you think that happiness is going to last ? not very long i guess  you have to understand that the only way to be happy is now  of course, i m not asking you to just  be happy  that s just not very logical  what i m saying is that you should stop waiting for something to be happy, that s it 

  4  wishing for something won t make it happen  

a goal without a plan is just a wish
saying you really want something or talking all day long about it won t make it happen  this is more of a reminder than a lesson, but still, it s useful to remember it  if you want something, make sure you take action, even if it s minimal at first, but the important thing is to move, do something 

  5  not giving up actually works  

you ve heard it a thousand times, you see it everywhere, and you think to yourself   that s just bullsh t, real life doesn t work like that   well, guess what ? it does  if you don t believe me, go and read the stories of the people who are really successful nowadays, a good example is steve jobs 
the main reason why people aren t doing what they want to do is because they give up too soon, then they start blaming life as if life was a person  if you read the stories of people who are insanely successful, you ll notice that one of their common traits is persistence 
sometimes, just reading about how some of these people were living makes you wonder how they didn t go insane  if you want something, don t give up on it 

  6  we often make excuses just to feel better  

we re all guilty here  sometimes you want to do something but you jump on the first chance you get to justify why you couldn t do it  you know, you say you don t have time but you watch tv for 3 hours a day  you say you don t have the money but you can t wait to buy the latest smartphone that you don t need  you say it s impossible when someone you know with half of what you have has done way better 
we re really good at making excuses and thinking about why we can t do it  the problem with that is that these excuses seem real and legit when in fact, it s just a way to escape the reality which is that we re afraid to put in the effort and fail  and here everyone is different  some are afraid of what people will say, some are afraid of wasting all that time for nothing, some are just lazy so they try to make it look as if they can t do it 
i think you get the point, even if your excuses seem real, they re just a way to justify your inaction, so start taking action instead 

  7  social norms are bullsh t  

one of the biggest and most common fears that all human beings on the planet share is the fear of what other people think  think about it, the world as you know it, and the social standards that you were conditioned to pick up were created by people who were no smarter than you, they were just born before you  does that make it right ? not really 
if you think maybe 40 years ahead and imagine yourself 40 years older  if you look back on your life, now that you re way older, does it matter to you what people were thinking of you when you were younger ? did it do any good if they thought you were good or bad ? not at all 

  8  the real risk is not taking any risk  

mark zuckerberg said it well, and he s actually right  we re always so afraid of taking risks, so we just stay in that comfort zone that we think will somehow protect us and make us feel safe  here s the thing   you ll never feel truly good about yourself if you never take any risk 
you have to stop being close minded and start considering new possibilities  try new things even if you might fail  if you never take risks, you ll never have anything remotely close to success  you have to try and step into the unknown, and even if you fail, there are people who were in situations that were more difficult, with fewer options, but they managed to create success because they take risks and always try to find a way out  remember, no risks   no success 

  9  until now you probably never realized what you re really 
capable of  

you know when you hear those inspirational talks and they say  you can do it  and you start thinking they re crazy or something ? well, they re not  unlike what some people might say, the reality actually shows you real proof that even the average person is just average because of his own self limitations 
our limits are self imposed because from childhood to adulthood, we are bombarded by beliefs that aren t ours, and we re forced to think that that s  reality   you want an example ? have you ever tried to tell your friends or family about a big ambition of yours ? maybe you want to invent something, become famous, or really rich  what do you think their reaction will be ? it s more than likely that they will make fun of you  do you know why ? it s because their model of reality was imposed by society, and they didn t hesitate to take it as the absolute truth 
even if there are a lot of people who broke this common belief that we re all meant to be  normal  and that s just a polite way to say mediocre by the way, most people still manage to find excuses like i mentioned in  6 by saying that the successful are lucky, that it s destiny, or that they re super talented  when you think like that, how can you possibly succeed when you think that success is related to stuff you can t control ?
the bottom line is that you can do way more than you think, and i m saying it seriously, not just to motivate you or anything  it s a proven fact

  10  the majority isn t always right  

 wrong does not cease to be wrong because the majority share in it  
  leo tolstoy
this quote makes the point really clear  you have to understand that even if 99 99  of people believe in something, it doesn t mean in any way that it s right  this belief itself, the belief that if a belief is accepted by the majority then it must be true is widely accepted, but it has been proved to be false countless times, so it s a great example 
in fact, the majority of people is often manipulated by the media, war propaganda, ads on tv, and the list goes on 
there are even more example that you ll find in the history books  countless inventors whose inventions have greatly revolutionized our lives were believed to be crazy and made fun of  just do the research and you ll find out yourself 
 whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to reform (or pause and reflect)

lastly, throughout my journey of transforming my life i learned a lot of different skills about human emotions  

things like beliefs, patterns of emotions, emotional stages, and identity creation,   you ll see what i mean later in this guide  

if you re currently struggling with some emotional challenges, i d say this is a good place to start  

i m excited for ya!

a little background before getting started, 

so who am i? what have i done with anxiety and depression? 

well, long story short, 

i m just a joyful and a loving person who is extremely passionate   maybe even qualified obsessed over human emotions  since young, i ve been curious about human behavior, emotions, and psyche and how we can use this knowledge to tap into the power of living up to our highest potential  (i think this is clearly illustrated in my previous posts) 

how did i go about to discover who am i?

the journey of discovering my own identity began at young age  when i was in high school my friends and classmates seemed clear and confident on what they wanted to do with their lives, and the kind of lives they want to have  i ve always wondered wether they got this confidence at home from their families  i felt that having your parents as role models makes the task of deciding your career and your future less of a challenge  

i ve always admired my parents perseverance and hard work to give me and my sisters a better education and life  i remember thinking as a child that i didn t want to work that hard to make ends meet like my parents  i didn t want to spend a lot of time working to provide even the most basic stuff in life  i remember telling myself if i can have better education, my life is going to be a lot better than my parents  

so, i did good until my grades in high school didn t qualify me to study medicine in college  med school was the natural choice for people who wanted to have respect and a good quality life  my mom was very sad the day my grades came out  i translated her sadness as my failure  i was very ashamed of my result and all of a sudden my dreams of having a better life became further and harder  

the day i joined college to study education was one of the worst days in my life  i thought of myself and everybody who was their in the class with me as a complete failure  we were a group of failures who weren t good enough to be accepted into the club of smart people who studied science and medicine  

i did a great job in my study at college and my grades qualified me to not only find a great job, but to also receive three scholarships that funded my graduate study abroad  despite all of my success, i ve always viewed myself as the failure that didn t get enough grades to join the faculty of medicine  

besides my issue with study and grades, i ve always felt lost and not sure about who i was or what i wanted in life  

for years i tried to pretend that my anxiety and depression aren t there  i tried to find reasons to justify my feelings  at times i even thought it was a personality defect that needs to be fixed, but i didn t know how to fix it  

i tried to fix myself more than i tried to work anything else around me  i never even questioned people s ideas or suggestions of how my life should be  the more i tried to do that, the harder it got  then i tried to completely ignore my feelings and just to pretend it s not there  this almost drove me insane more than anything else, because i was constantly lying to myself and to others  this is what i call  emotional pretending  and it s the worst kind of acting you could ever do  

when i got frustrated after trying to work this out in different ways and not getting the result i was looking for, i decided to give up and just keep my life going the way it was  then during a work trip abroad something happened and it rocked my whole world  the amount of fear i had at that time was more than i ve ever experienced in my entire life  the intensity of fear and pain forced me to either accept this to be the reality of my life or to step up and do something to save myself and my life  

 since i made this decision years ago, my life has been going from good to better in a way that i could ve never imagined  

                                                           

following are the five emotional stages i went through to discover my true identity and they are followed by five principles that hugely impact our identity formation over years of our lives  

often when we get stuck in life we could pass through these five stages of emotions  the intensity of these emotion varies from a person to another and from a situation to another  some people are more aware of these emotions and they know how to utilize it to get what they want in life  whereas others ponder in these emotions for a while until they find a way out  unfortunately, there are also people who live their entire lives without having a clue what their lives were even about  

before we get to the 5 stages, let me answer two questions that could be going on in your mind now  

the first is  can i do that?   do i know who i am?   

the second question is?  what would i benefit from finding out my true identity?    what s going to be different in my life after i finish this process? 

the answer to the first question is  yes  you are capable of doing anything that you believe you could do  i believe that all of us have the answer to this question deep inside, but some people choose to dig this answer out while others leave it buried down underneath daily routines and busy life  if you give yourself the gift of taking some time to yourself to sit in a quiet place, you will find out who you are and you will come up with the answers to this question  

the benefit that you will get by answering this question is the ability to understand and then change your behaviors and actions to get the results you want  when you find out what makes you who you are, you find out the reason you do what you do, and once you have the ability to change the way you define yourself, you have the ability to change the behaviors that get in the way of living up to your fullest potential  

now that we got the answers of these two questions out of the way, let s begin with the five emotional stages that you could pass by to find out who you are  

1) confusion and loss 

this is how the majority of us start to feel when we are not sure of what s goin on, we feel this subtle discomfort, we feel unhappy, but we don t even know what s it all coming from  this feeling of confusion slowly creeps in and steals clarity and balance from our lives  we start feeling confused about a career, a relationship, or any other circumstance  the next thing we don t even know who we are  

the intensity of our emotions about our lives circumstances impacts our perceptions of everything including ourselves and our identities  during this time of our lives if we re asked directly  who are you? , the only answer we could think of is either surprise, shock, or a blank stare  

people could spend various amounts of time in this stage  i know i spent high school and early college years in this stage  during those years i ve always been uncomfortable and unclear on what i wanted to do with my life  i had no sense of clarity or direction  

when i was in high school i thought i wanted to study medicine like my classmates, but deep inside i knew this wasn t what i truly wanted  i tried to hide my confusion and loss by pretending to seek a dream that wasn t mine 

confusion is a sign that we need to do something to gain clarity back  confusion is the first signal that you receive to notice that something isn t right  

so if you re in the confusion stage of your life, i invite you to get a pen and paper and ask yourself  

 what am i confused about? is it my career? is it my relationship with my partner, my mom, my dad, or a friend? is it an important decision that you need to make, bu you don t know how to?  

so, the first step is to get clear on what you re confused about  

the second step is to ask yourself 

 why am i confused about this?   is it because i need more information to get more clear? or because i need to talk to somebody to get clear on understanding a situation or behavior? 

the third step is to find out what you can do to get past confusion to gain clarity, make a decision, and move forward  

so, ask yourself 

 what can i do now to get clear on what i must do to resolve this situation?  write down all the ways or solutions you could do to get clear and take action  

fourth step, start with the solution that gets more results with little effort (the 20  that gets you the 80  results)  

for example there were many things i could ve done back in high school to resolve my confusion about studying medicine  talking to friends who already joined medical school, reading about medicine, volunteering to any medical associated roles, all of this could ve given me a better feeling and understanding of studying medicine  

2) battle 

when confusion isn t resolved in the right time, it could turn to a feeling of inner emotional battle  we start to contemplate things and ask questions that we ve never asked ourselves before  our energy is often consumed by the emotional fight between feeling that we need to do something, and fear of the unknown  we re torn and stuck in the no man s land  we have so much pain and yet we re too scared to do something to end our pain  

to set ourselves free from this emotional battle, we need to find sufficient answers to our questions, and take action to move ahead  

so if you re currently stuck in the battle stage and you want to do something to free yourself, here are some steps to guide you forward  

first, write down the issue that s causing you the emotional battle, this could be a problem with your job, marriage, losing weight, making a business decision, anything that giving you this sense of emotional fight over what to do  

second, write down the things that you ve lost and the things you will still lose if you continue in this battle mode without resolving things  so, let s say, you have a problem with your marriage or intimate relationship, the cost of this problem could be things like  

emotional pain
constant disputes and fights with partner 
sleepless nights for fear of loosing him her
inability to focus at your job 
loosing money bonus at work for poor job performance 
if you have children, negatively impact children mental and emotional wellness 

third, write down the things you ll gain in all areas of your life when you resolve this issue  back to the same marriage example, some of the gains could be  

having a soul level relationship with spouse or partner 
deep and genuine feeling of love and joy 
deep emotional connection with partner 
emotional strength to give to others 
dedication and passion at work 
having the mental and emotional clarity and peace to focus and give your best at work and at home 
confident, strong, and kind children who have amazon loving parents as a role model 

fourth, intensify the feelings of lose and gain, make them so vivid and powerful in your mind that you have no other option but to get up and act to resolve things  

one mistake that i did back when i was in high school was that i stayed for far too long in this battle stage  i asked myself what if medicine isn t the answer, what if i want to be something else?   

however, i didn t utilize the emotions of lose and gain  i didn t think about the cost of keeping my battle unresolved on the longterm, and i didn t consider the reward of clarity on the trajectory of my life  

the result was that my emotions evolved into the next stage of crazy loops  

3) crazy loop

the common mistake that most of us do is to treat our emotions as though they were the root of the problem  whereas, they are nothing but signals for an unresolved problem  

when we don t pay attention to our emotional battles, they intensify and could revolve into other emotions that become the way we satisfy our emotional needs  

this time the inner fight is shaped into a repeated pattern of emotions that perpetuates our pain  the longer we stay within this stage, the harder it becomes to break out of it and the deeper the emotional impact becomes on our lives  

the repeated emotional pattern varies from an individual to another  for me it was hanging between anger and sadness  whereas anger represented my need to gain control back and take action to change my life, and sadness represented missing the connection with others whom influenced my decisions more than i did  

these emotional loops became my new comfort zone where i lived almost all the time  it represented the new limits that i unconsciously set for myself to avoid making any decision or taking any action  

the mistake i did at that time was that i allowed others to have more control over my life s decisions than i do  i gave up some of my power to others and i felt angry and weak because of it  

if you re reading this and you re experiencing this crazy loop of emotions, here s how you can break out of it if you re ready  

first, get clear on what your emotional crazy loop is by asking yourself  

 what are the two emotions that i swing between most of the time?  write them down 

then ask yourself  

 what do i get out of these emotions?   what s the emotional need this pattern currently meets?  

i knew i need to have more control over my life, my decisions, and my actions  this is what i got out of anger because when i become angry i feel that i have the strength to claim back my power to make overdue decisions  anger also was my way to show others my power to make sure their control is limited and so is their influence  

so  what do you get out of the destructive emotions you currently indulge yourself in? 

4) peak moment of pain 

we could continue living in the crazy loop stage for a while until an event or an experience breaks our ongoing pattern  for me i lived in this stage for years after graduation and early career until a series of painful events pushed me to the uncomfortable zones of new emotions land and out of my crazy loop  i experienced high and intense levels of emotional pain that forced me to reconsider who i was, the kind of choices i made, and the kind of life i lived  

this was the peak moment that could either make or break  i was faced with two choices and was forced to choose either to change and expand myself and my life, or to continue to live with pain or the rest of my life  

remember that this peak moment of pain could ve been avoided by a decision to resolve things out before the intensity levels up  the exercise i guided you though in the second stage of  battle  could be used to sort of create this peak moment without having to wait for the tide to throw you off shore 

5) resolve or revolve 

the decision we make at this peak moment is a critical one for the rest of our lives and the lives of generations to come  our decision to face fear and to get clear on who we are and what our life is about will shape our lives in a completely different way than if we choose to live in closed circles of destructive emotions, problems, and disempowering life stories  

it s also important to note here that when we first try to work things out, we could experience a temporary feeing of frustration  this is normally because we re at the stage of searching for a strategy that gets us the results we want  however, we could easily get lost in this search for the effective strategy  we might mistakenly think that if our strategy doesn t work, then there s a possibility that the problem is unsolvable  

in this case it s essential to remember that our primary goal is to resolve our emotional struggle not to prove ourselves right by sticking to a strategy that has proven not to work  this distinction is very important because the clearer we are on the problem we want to solve and the result we want to achieve, the less likely we ll become distracted by any shiny object in the search journey, and the easier it becomes to maintain our focus on where we want to go versus where we are stuck at the moment  

part of emotional strength is the ability to keep going when your strategy isn t working  your power lies in persistence and flexibility  once you become clear on the result you re after, develop enough flexibility to try as many strategies as needed until you get the end you want  

                                                      

truth of the matter is that none of the previous exercises could get you the most effective results unless you are crystal clear on what you want  the easiest way to know what you want in life is to know exactly who you are  it s common for people to get confused between the ends and the means in life  

my parents  desire for me to join medical school was the means to get to the end result of financial security, social recognition, and a better future for my children  but instead of having me focus on different ways to get security, recognition, and a better future, i was caught up in the means to get the end result  

they had the best intention and they did it with love, but the focus was on the wrong target  

there were countless ways i could ve achieved my goal, had i known what the real goal was in the first place  medicine was only a possibility among thousand others  medicine in itself is, like many other professions, requires hard work, dedication, and passion to the study and application of medicine to help elevate others  suffering  

now, i ll guide you through the ten principles that could assist you to find out who you are, and to get clear on what you want in life  

principle 1  is your identity yours or is it what others have decided for you 

our identities are developed from beliefs, and past events or experiences of our lives  now the question here is, did you consciously choose those beliefs and events? have you consciously constructed these beliefs? or were they imposed upon you by others consciously or unconsciously? have you chosen to take part in these events or were they imposed upon you without your consent or choice? 

the majority of the beliefs we get in our childhood are usually the result of others ideas or opinions  they gradually get the emotional association that turns them into an effective part of who we are  then we start using these beliefs to define ourselves and to set boundaries of what we believe is possible or impossible for us  

for example, a teacher calls a student  a slow learner  or  retarded , soon this teacher s opinion of this child becomes his new reality and he starts to define himself herself as such  the danger with this is that this personal opinion that was planted in this child s mind long ago could shape the decisions and the actions this child makes for the rest of his her life  

unless this child grows to believe of one s ability, this child might never tap into into power to be and do beyond the limiting belief of his teacher  

you see, the danger of treating others opinions as facts that couldn t be questioned or doubted is that we could spend our entire lives as prisoners of these beliefs  social proof is nothing but a source of opinions that we could solicit if needed, but it should never be the reference or the ceiling that keeps us confined  

pages of history books are full of heroes and heroines who decided not to listen to what others s beliefs  they decided, acted, and lived out of their own strong beliefs and achieved what have been once perceived as impossible  

so what you could do right now is to find out whether you consciously chose the beliefs that constructed your identity, or whether your beliefs were mainly driven from social proof? 

you could do that by asking yourself 

 what beliefs govern my identity?   when i think of myself, what beliefs come to my mind about myself, my skills, my abilities, my relationships, my mission in life, my future, my finance, and my health?  

the next step is to read all the beliefs you wrote out loud, then ask yourself  

 which of these beliefs have you consciously developed and chosen to use in your life? and which of them have you unconsciously picked up from others in your surrounding environment (e g  home, school, club, etc )? 

how many of all of your beliefs are actually yours? 
 
circle the ones you have consciously developed and chosen on your own, and ask yourself 

 does this belief empower me to be my best, and to do my best?  

if it does, then think of ways to expand the use of this belief in different areas of your life 

if it doesn t, then ask yourself  

 how does this belief ruin my life and cost me a lot? 

 then turn to the beliefs you think you got from outside, and ask yourself  

 does this belief empower me to be my best, and to do my best?  

if it does, then think of ways to expand the use of this belief in different areas of your life 

if it doesn t, then ask yourself  

  how does this belief ruin my life and cost me a lot?   was the person i got this belief producing the results i want to get in my life? does he deserve to be a role model for me? is s he the kind of mentor i want to learn from?  

this step alone will get you in front of thousands of people who live their entire lives without having a clue of who they are, or what their life is about  

more importantly, it will give you the power of clarity on your identity, which makes it easier to understand your emotions, and change your behavior  

principle 2  true capacity vs belief of maximum ability 

normally we use our beliefs of who we think we are as an indicator of what we are capable and incapable of achieving  the problem is that these beliefs are built upon our interpretations of previous experiences and events in our lives  now the question is, what if these experiences weren t all positive? what if you attempted to do something, but things did t work out for your that time  let s say for example a person tried to learn how to swim and during one of the attempts this person almost drowned  this person could use this one experience and develops a belief that he she is unable to learn how to swim  

what happened here is that a misinterpretation of a past life event was used to generalize a result of a one time attempt that didn t work out  however, can we say that this person has any factual reasons that prevent him her from learning swimming? no, it s just a belief that was developed and sustained to back up a limitation that this person imposed on him herself  

the reality is that everybody could learn how to swim   even the people who were told they were unable for physical issues   so the capacity to learn how to swim is always there  however this person s ability to tap into this capacity is confined by his belief that he s unable  all this person needs to do is to shift his belief and find an effective strategy to learn how to swim  

this applies to many beliefs that we have unconsciously developed over time  a business that didn t work out, a relationship that bottomed out, an attempt to quit smoking or drugs, loosing weight, not getting the desired results out of these experiences could lead us to inaccurate conclusions that we organize into beliefs  these beliefs become the boundaries within which we live and the frame that confines the maximum of our abilities  

hopefully you did the exercise described in principle one, if you did i want you to go back to all the beliefs you wrote down and ask yourself  

 which of these beliefs have i developed from previous not so successful experiences? 

 is it possible that i misjudged the situation to develop this belief?   how could i have misjudged the situation?  

 what did this belief cost me in the past, present, and future?  

 do i want to continue be directed by this belief?  

by asking yourself these set of questions you find out whether you re currently using your full capacity or you re prisoned by your belief of who you think you are  

principle 3  labels become identities 

one of the dangers of buying into social proof is that we could easily believe in the labels that are generated by individuals, organizations, or systems  

the day i was  diagnosed  with adhd was one of the very tough days of my life  when the learning specialist handed me the big file that carried the results of my scan, i felt as if a badge was suddenly stuck to my forehead branding me with   learning disability    he said very little words during the whole procedure and his serious and strict attitude gave me an impression that my case was hopeless 

the impact of this procedure is that if we re not couscous, the label could easily become our new identity  adhd isn t a  learning disability , but rather its a sign that you need to find a more effective way to learn  

the minute i started buying into my new identity as a  learning disabled , i doubted my capacity to learn or to produce the study work that was required to get my degree  even though i ve always been a good student with very good grades, i allowed the new label to confine me and to rip away my previous achievements  

the mistake that most of us fall in is that we treat the label as the ultimate truth that shapes our present and future  we trust the labels more than we trust ourselves, and we believe in them more than we believe in our capacities  

how many great people in the history of mankind were given labels that could ve kept them captives to limitation and weakness  however, these great people and thousands of others who live amongst us have chosen to uncover their deepest powers and summon their right to shape their lives the way they want not what they were told  

it s key to remember here that our identities are constantly evolving and expanding  what seemed to be hard one day becomes our everyday reality as we keep pushing the boundaries that we ve previously set for ourselves  

this is your opportunity to push your boundaries back, by asking yourself  

 which of the beliefs i wrote is developed from a label that was stuck to me by a person, a system?  

ask yourself  

 how does this belief hinder me from tapping into my full capacity to achieve what i truly want?  

now replace this  lie  with your new truth as you write the antithesis of this lie  

reflect back to your past and find experiences that support your new truth  

if you can t find any experience to support your new truth, the next principle will give you an alternative  

principle 4  you re not a prisoner to your past 

often we identify ourselves according to our past identities and experiences  this could create limitations that no longer exist in our lives  

let s say for example a person used to consume drugs in the past, but now this person is ready to quit  the challenge here is two fold  first this person has to create a new identity as someone who never even considers the possibility of using drugs under any circumstances, the second is that people around this person has to approach him her as a different person from the one he once was  

associating the old behavior to the new identity is the recipe for failure in changing any destructive behavior  

people assume that changing a behavior is enough to create the life you want, but in order to ensure achieving the desired result, a change in behavior has to be accompanied with a change in identity  

putting your present and future in the box of your past will only get you the results of the past  this allows a picture from the past to miss up your reality and your dreams  

people and societies might give us a hard time when they keep us hostages of our past misdeeds, but even this changes with time  when you continue to prove once and once again that you re no longer who and what you ve been once, there comes a time when people have no choice but to recognize your new identity and approach you with respect for the discipline and commitment you showed in reshaping yourself and your life 

so if there s a part of your identity that has given you pain in the past, you could take this opportunity to change it right here and right now  here s how you can do that  

ask yourself  

 what s one way i identify myself that i no longer want to use?  

for example, after i was told that i had adhd, i used to believe that  i am a slow learner   i truly thought of myself as someone who s unable to receive and process information fast  of course this belief kept me from even trying to do better or looking for a better way to learn faster  

shifting my identity to  a fast learner  as well as finding the right strategy to receive and process information in bitable chunks made a huge difference in my learning  

then, choose an opposite empowering identity to the disempowering one you currently have  

so, if you used to think of yourself as  a fat person  only because you couldn t lose weight, your new identity could be  a health nut  or  a power of energy   any exciting and enticing identity that empowers you to get up and do the work with a strong conviction that you are  a heath nut  and no longer a  fat person   

you see the power of this exercise is that we all have an unconscious need to maintain consistency with who we believe we are  we think that sticking to our identities is what keeps us anchored in our lives  we feel that if we give up who we are, then we no longer have a clear sense of direction to guide our feelings and behaviors  

so the challenge isn t that you can t  give up  drugs, but it s that you identified yourself as  a drug addict   drug addiction is a temporary circumstance that you could change anytime you decide to  whereas, being  a drug addict  labels you as someone who has the thoughts, the feelings, and the actions of a drug addict  you have to divorce your identity to be able to change your thoughts, feelings, and actions about addiction and about who you truly are  

principle 5  consistency is rewarded and inconsistency is punished 

one of the very common reasons that keep so many people from changing their identities is their sense of commitment towards what others recognize them with  at the end of the day we all want to be loved and accepted  this is one reason why we continue to act in consistency to past beliefs or views 

for example, let s say that a person has joined a political party, and at one point in time this person starts to question the ideology of this party  this individual could develop a strong belief that this party doesn t represent or work for people s true needs, yet he or she continues to become part of it  the reason is that this individual has associated his or her identity to being a member of the party  

leaving the party could mean that this person s behavior isn t consistent to her his beliefs about the party and its ideology  so the person could continue as a member just to avoid being called things like hypocrite, or flakey  so the punishment of the inconsistency between behavior and belief overcame the reward of being true to oneself and claiming a new identity  

so the decision each and everyone of us has to make is to choose between  

1  the external reward of being called trustworthy, honest, consistent, woman or man of integrity with the inner pain of knowing that your behavior isn t who you truly are  
2  the external pain of being called flakey, liar, untrustworthy with the inner peace and integrity of being honest with yourself and others regardless of any temporary consequences  

the good news is that the external pain in the second option will change over time when people recognize your commitment to your new identity  

so, person who s  a recovering drug addict  could be ridiculed or enticed to get back to being  a dirt addict   but with commitment and consistency to new identity this person gradually turns into  a health nut  who s crazy about maintaining emotional and physical wellness  this then changes to  a health expert  who s approached by others who ask for advice and guidance to replicate her his results  

you see, behavior, action, and results speak louder than words  so s he who shows the most commitment to one s decision of change is the one that gets all the rewards, even the respect of those who once talked you down

take 10 minutes to think about what's the most stressful for you during the day  write out everything that comes to your mind  they can be people, activities, objects, etc  anything that causes you stress  now, looking at each stressor separately, think about whether you can eliminate it  if it is possible, throw it out of your life immediately  also, think about how you can prevent some situations  i decided that i would choose routes where there are no traffic jams, or i would leave the house early enough always to have time for a meeting

i remember that once i used to do several activities at the same time  i wrote some text on the computer, in the meantime, i packed something for mailing, watched television from the corner of my eye, and i also talked on the phone  such a habit can produce a lot of stress in your life  therefore, always deal with one thing at a time  no stress is just one of the advantages of this approach  when you do one thing at a time, you'll pay the most attention to it and make it faster and better  when you do several things at the same time it's not enough that it will take you a lot more time, it will still be worse quality "

0,"how to improve creative thinking   7 simple tips creativity is today an extremely desirable feature, especially on the labor market  why? creative thinking not only allows you to create beautiful and valuable things but also to skillfully deal with stressful situations  however, sometimes creative thinking does not come quickly at all  many of us are known for the lack of original inspiration or so called ""heavy thinking "" how to prevent this? exercising and stimulating creative thinking  several reliable tricks will help  here they are 

  listen to music often  

the first way is to listen to music regularly  scientific research confirms that music stimulates the part of the brain that is responsible for creativity and emotions  classical music works best for the brain  it improves not only creative thinking but also concentration and other essential cognitive functions  if you want to increase your creativity, go for classics or jazz 

  try to write by hand  

handwriting also has a beneficial effect on brain function  in the computer age, unfortunately, we practice it less and less  however, it is worth to write something by hand from time to time  our gray cells will work better, and the head will gain more new ideas  the most dangerous thing for the brain is a schematic and routine action that kills creativity and weakens the condition of the mind 

  walk a lot  

the fresh air, specifically oxygen, also has a positive effect on creative thinking  therefore, you should regularly walk, run and practice different types of outdoor sports  also, even light, but regular physical exercise improves memory and concentration 

  regularly sleep  

it is well known that sleep is the basis of health and proper functioning, although many of us forget about it and take care of work and study nights  if we want our brains to be a matter, we should sleep regularly at night, but also remember about dozen minutes of naps during the day  a short rest after work will help us relax so that we can think better 

  learn new things  

science stimulates brain cells to work, improves intellectual performance and   as you can easily imagine   increases creativity  that is why it is worth continually learning new things, getting to know the world and setting ambitious goals  our brain requires constant gymnastics to work well 

  create when you are tired  

hardly anyone is aware of it, but the most creative ideas are born in our head when we are tired  why? because creativity is the result of wandering around unrelated issues  it is therefore worth creating when we are slightly tired but not overworked!

  surround yourself blue and green  

it has been scientifically proven that blue and green increase mental performance and improve cognitive processes  thus, they enhance creative thinking  that's why it's best to work in green or blue rooms  we feel less tired then and think better "

there are always going to be dirty dishes  

that pile will be right there again tomorrow, with no sign of your previous efforts  how maddening is that? there will always be laundry and trash  there will always be pain, hunger, financial issues, fights with family and friends, or what have you 

so, do you just give up? it sure is an option  you can  contemplate the meaninglessness of your existence,  and that gives you a pretty good excuse not to do the dishes  but that comes with consequences, doesn t it? when you don t work on solving your problems, your problems spread like weeds  gardens will always have weeds  it s just your job to deal with them, so you can enjoy your garden 

if you want any chance at having a happy and healthy life, you can t try and make the dishes go away forever  that s quite silly  the only sane thing to do is figure out how to enjoy doing the dishes  and that is very different from seeking the accomplishment you get from finishing the dishes 

there is an old story called the myth of sisyphus  

he was a man banished to hell, and his punishment was to roll a giant boulder up a hill  as soon as he got close to the top, the boulder would roll all the way back down to the bottom, no matter how hard he pushed  his only option was to try again, even knowing the eventual fate of his struggle against the boulder 

unfortunately for the devil, sisyphus found happiness  he spend eternity trying to solve an unsolvable problem, and loved it  maybe he went crazy, and maybe being crazy is actually being sane  maybe we all have to be a little crazy, if we want any chance of enjoying this life 

so, go do the dishes  then, do the next thing  

deal with your financial debt, start the most uncomfortable conversation in the world, or dig into the worst part of whatever your career makes you do  lean in  have a laugh at the ridiculousness of your situation 

maybe next year, you ll have a million dollars, the partner of your dreams, and complete inner peace  you ll still have some version of  dishes  to take care of  just breathe and get to it "

0,"is your energy trapped by fear? before i made the conscious decision to break free from the emotional trap i was stuck at, every time i tried to change, i would come up with a story why i can t or why it s too hard  i used to back away to story mode as a reason why i m the way i am and things are the way they are  

however, the day i hit rock bottom i realized that i used a story to justify not taking action and not doing what i knew needs to be done  the reality is that i was scared, i was scared to make a decision and i was scared to get out of my comfort zone  

blaming others and circumstances was usually a story that i used a lot  i used to blame my parents for not having enough money to give me a better education  i used to blame them for not having the education and the profession that would guarantee a higher social status for our family  i used to blame them for not giving me the best experiences as a child  we didn t travel much, no fancy toys or clothes  

i felt that by not having all these things, i had to work harder to earn it all  this has put extra pressure on me to study and work hard  i always thought about how my life would have been different had they given me everything i ever wanted when i wanted it  

i d never told my parents any of these feelings, and sometimes i was ashamed of myself to think that way  this made me push my feelings away and sometime dismiss them as an embarrassing personal problem  on the long run this approach didn t help much because my feelings tried to find a new outlet since i refused to acknowledge them  

the realization that sifted my life was becoming aware of how my emotions were shaping every step of my life  fear was taking control of my emotional system and hacking the code of my mind to blind my mental and emotional wise vision  

the truth is that this story is nothing but a distraction form the real problem  my mind was trying to keep me safe by holding me back from going to unvisited territories  my mind didn t want me to make serious decisions to resolve many things in my life because i was scared  so instead of facing my fear, my mind used this story as a camouflage to hide it  

truth is that my parents were never the problem, they did the best they could to give and me and my sisters the best life they could provide us  they held no effort back to make our lives way better than theirs  they were nothing but supportive and loving  if it wasn t for the challenges they faced in their lives, they would have never been so determined to bring me up better than the way their parents brought them up 

being aware of the tricks that fear was playing on me made me appreciate their love, effort and sacrifices in ways i never did before  i finally was able to see the view from their seat and it s light years different from my version of story  i was too selfish to feel the suffer and pain they endured for our family  

now, i couldn t be prouder of them and everyday i m grateful to have them by my side  every time i look at their eyes i can see long work days, little sleep, tired bodies, and worried minds thinking about how to provide and give more  anytime i feel exhausted in my air conditioned lakeview office, i remember how hard it must have been to work in more difficult conditions  this tiny comparison puts things into perspective and brings my selfishness and fear to their knees as i go back to work harder and give more  

my energy to work, give, love, and live was trapped by my fear of divorcing my story  it was trapped by fear of making a decision, going outside, meeting new people, working hard for my dreams, daring to live the life i want  i was set free the day i decided to face my fear and design a new story that emperors me to be the best i could  

my parents hardship made them the people they are, but it also made me the person i am, and it will make my children the people they would become  it would have been hard to achieve this level of awareness that pushes us to do more and to be more if it wasn t for the hard time my parents went though  this is how a couples  challenge could continue to impact generations when we re honest to face our fears and not to scared to give it all  

truth is we re all scared and we all have stories about our difficult circumstances, and these stories are valid and worthy of respect  but at the end, it all comes down to what andy dufresne said in his brilliant scene in the shawshank redemption  get busy living or get busy dying   that s all it is

0,"5 good reasons you should start reading books today i m sure you ve heard it before  you should read books  and maybe you re thinking that it s a bit boring or even a waste of time  i don t blame you because i was the same way until i accidentally read my first book 

before you read any further, let me tell you that the only way you can really see how useful books can be is by actually reading a couple of them  it s one of the things that you appreciate and see the value in them only after doing them 
okay, now let s get to the point  how will reading books help you ? let s find out 

  1  you gain a lot of experience in a short time  

most of the time you want to read a book that was written by someone who s had a meaningful experience because he can teach you stuff that you don t know 
the biggest advantage when you read a book is that you can pick up many years of experience just by reading a single book in a week so you re saving yourself a lot of time, effort and potentially money just by learning from others  experience  this means you can avoid their mistakes and follow their advice since they have already achieved what you want to do 

  2  you can solve problems more easily  

we all have our problems but guess what ? other people have already figured it out  reading books can greatly help you to solve your own problems  there s a book for almost anything now 

you want to get rich ? no problem  you want to develop yourself ? there are plenty of books to help you  you want to learn how to cook ? plenty to choose from 
in a nutshell, reading a lot of books will help you solve problems becaue you have an already laid out plan that was created by someone who has faced the same problem before 

  3  you learn from real world experience  

you know how we learn a ton of stuff in school and university but we never really use that in real life ? that s exactly the opposite with books  the good thing is that you get the real stuff  you can learn lessons from real people who tell you how you can do what you want to do without the unnecessary nonsense that you see in formal education 
in other words, you strictly get the information that you need, not some abstract theories 

  4  you become more knowledgeable  

that s not a surprise  you read books so you know more stuff, it makes sense  becoming more knowledgeable can help you become a more interesting person and a better conversationalist since you can talk about a wide variety of topics 

it also helps to know more stuff because you ll face small challenges every day  having basic insights about social skills, self help or even finance can help you deal with whatever life throws at you 

  5  you pick up a new mindset  

while books can provide useful information, they can also teach you an entirely new way of thinking  you can discover some ideas and truths that will make you dramatically shift the way you think 

you know, the  aha  moment  you get to a point where you feel like you figured something out and you were totally wrong before  this means that you can pick up a mindset that will allow you to reach the desired result 
books don t just teach you stuff you didn t know, they also teach you how to think in a certain way

there is a way to overcome worry that doesn t involve alcohol or a straitjacket 

the answer is thousands of years old   but now science is validating those ancient ideas  you ve probably even heard of it  mindfulness 

yeah, it s all the rage now  but nobody ever seems to really explain what it is or how to do it 

let s fix that 

   tl dr watch this video   (


 you are not your thoughts

what is mindfulness? in his book, the mindfulness solution, ronald siegel, an assistant clinical professor of psychology at harvard medical school, gives a pretty good answer 

via the mindfulness solution  everyday practices for everyday problems 

 gt the working definition of mindfulness that my colleagues and i find most helpful is awareness of present experience with acceptance  

you might say  but i m aware  i m present  i m accepting 

and i d say  no, you re not 

you re not aware  you re staring at your iphone 

you re not present  you re worrying about the future 

you re not accepting  you re shaking your fist at traffic because the world doesn t match the vision in your brain of how it  should  be 

very often, we re all stuck in our heads 

we re not taking the world in  we re just listening to the stories we tell ourselves about the world, trusting the endless parade of thoughts flitting through our heads instead of actually paying attention to life around us 

one of the fundamental tenets of mindfulness is that we all take our thoughts wayyyyyy too seriously  we think our thoughts always mean something  in fact, we think we are our thoughts and our thoughts are us 

and that s one of the reasons we worry so much and experience so many negative emotions   because we take our thoughts about the world more seriously than the world itself 

via the mindfulness solution  everyday practices for everyday problems 

 gt mindfulness practice brings all sorts of insights into the workings of the mind  perhaps the hardest to grasp is the idea that thoughts are not reality  we re so accustomed to providing a narrative track to our lives and believing in our story that to see things otherwise is a real challenge 

you know as well as i do that all kinds of ridiculous thoughts go through our heads  and sometimes you know not to trust them  when you re tired, drunk, angry or sick you don t take your thoughts as seriously 

mindfulness says you should go a step further  because you have lots of crazy or silly thoughts all the time  and they can make you anxious or bring you down 

the great psychologist albert ellis said we should dispute our irrational thoughts  great advice   but it can be difficult  you have to be exceedingly rational for it to work 

and sometimes disputing those thoughts can be like a  chinese finger trap    the more you resist, the more they ensnare you 

so what can you do?

 observe  don t judge 

sometimes you can t easily dispute those worrying thoughts  so mindfulness simply says  let them go 

via the mindfulness solution  everyday practices for everyday problems 

 gt mindfulness practice helps us avoid the trap of counterproductive thoughts by learning to let them go 

you can t turn your brain off  and even if you meditate for years you can never fully clear your mind  but you can see those troublesome thoughts, recognize them, but not get tangled in believing them 

via the mindfulness solution  everyday practices for everyday problems 

 gt remember, this practice is not about emptying the mind, getting rid of difficult emotions, escaping life s problems, being free of pain, or experiencing never ending bliss  mindfulness practice is about embracing our experience as it is and sometimes what is can be unpleasant at the moment  we usually try to feel better by decreasing the intensity of painful experiences  in mindfulness practice, we work instead to increase our capacity to bear them 

and scientific research shows this really works  people feel better and are more engaged with their work after 8 weeks of mindfulness practice 

via the mindfulness solution  everyday practices for everyday problems 

 gt dr  davidson and dr  jon kabat zinn recruited a group of pressured workers in a biotechnology firm and taught half of them mindfulness meditation for three hours per week over an eight week period  they compared this group to a similar group of coworkers who were not taught meditation  on average, all of the workers tipped to the right in their prefrontal cortical activity before taking up meditation  however, after taking the eight week course, the meditating group now had more left sided activation than the nonmeditators  the meditators also reported that their moods improved and they felt more engaged in their activities 

i know, i know  easier said than done, eric  

ignore your thoughts? let them just float by? sounds great but how the heck do you do that? especially when they re emotionally powerful feelings like worry 

the key is attention  yeah, that thing none of us seems to have anymore 

but there s a way to get it back 

 don t distract  immerse 

i ve posted before about how important attention is to happiness  and one of the key practices of mindfulness is meditation, which has been shown in scientific studies to improve attention 

while i m a huge believer in meditation, yes, it can be hard and takes time  is there another way? yup 

next time you re worrying, remember that your thoughts aren t real  life is real 

so turn your attention to your senses  to the world around you  (no, not to your smartphone )

how does that cup of coffee smell? did you even notice the people nearby?

don t distract yourself  immerse yourself in the world around you 

via the mindfulness solution  everyday practices for everyday problems 

 gt the approach teaches people mindfulness practices with a particular emphasis on not taking any thoughts too seriously but rather staying grounded in sensual reality here and now  instead of fantasizing about the next moment of entertainment, you can turn your attention to the sights and sounds of standing in line, buying a cup of coffee, and walking down the street  instead of getting frustrated because the train is late, you can study the other passengers (discreetly), notice the architecture of the station, and attend to the sensations in your body as you sit and wait  there is always something interesting to do just pay attention to what is occurring right now 

i know what some of you are thinking  the worries keep coming back, eric  smelling the coffee didn t make them go away 

no sweat  we have tools for this 

 noting and labeling

rather than dodging, disputing, or distracting (which can all lead to you just wrestling with those ideas further) acknowledge the thoughts   note  them 

you re not avoiding your thoughts  you acknowledge them  and then turn your attention back to your senses  to your breath  to the feel of the chair beneath your butt  to the person next to you 

for thoughts that keep playing like a broken record, try  labeling  them  siegel suggests giving the thought a funny name that trivializes it  oh, that  it s not going to work out  tape is playing in my head again 

via the mindfulness solution  everyday practices for everyday problems 

 gt when the thoughts arise, label them silently before letting them go  you don t need very many categories  you might choose labels such as  planning,   doubting,   judging,   fantasizing,  obsessing,  or  criticizing   the particular labels aren t crucial  what matters is using them to avoid being captured by stories or repetitive tapes  once you label a thought, gently bring your attention back to the breath  if you find that your attention is repeatedly carried away by particular stories, try making up a humorous label for them  give these greatest hits their own names, such as your  i blew it again  tape,  i can t get no respect  tape,  i never get what i want  tape, and so on 

sound like silly, hippie nonsense? well, you know those worries that bring you down and make you sad?

a study found mindfulness therapies were just as effective as antidepressants  in fact, many who practiced them regularly were subsequently able to ditch their medication 

via the mindfulness solution  everyday practices for everyday problems 

 gt in another, more recent study, mbct was shown to be as effective as antidepressants in preventing relapses of depression and allowed many subjects to discontinue their medication 

okay, let s round this up into a simple system you can use 

 sum up

here s how to stop worrying and start being mindful 

you are not your thoughts  sometimes they re downright ridiculous  just because you think it, doesn t make it true 

observe, don t judge  acknowledge the thoughts, but let them float by  don t wrestle with them 

don t distract, immerse  do not check your email for the 400th time  take in the world around you  turn to your senses  that s real  your thoughts and the stories you tell yourself about the world aren t 

note or label intrusive thoughts  yeah, the thoughts fight back  

acknowledge them  give the intrusive ones a funny name 

return to the senses  really pay attention to the world around you 

and when i say to pay more attention to the world around you, that doesn t just mean things  it s also people 

what ends a lot of relationships?  you don t pay enough attention to me  

when we endeavor to let the thoughts in our head go and embrace the world around us, we can focus more attention on the ones we love 

as mindfulness expert jon kabat zinn points out, in a number of asian languages  mind  and  heart  are the same word 

so mindfulness isn t a cold or clinical process  it might as well be translated as  heartfulness

0,"you snooze, you loose there were times when i wondered why would i even wake up or get out of bed in the morning  i had nothing to live for  i had no good enough reason to get me to want to move and do something  nothing in my life seemed compelling or exciting to look forward to  i knew i had to start there, i needed to set a very exciting goal that fuels me and puts the biggest smile on my face  


in my past life, i used to have this conversation with my mind every singe morning  


me   the alarm is on, i need to wake up  

my mind   just couple more minutes, press the snooze now and we ll get it next time it s on!  

me   you re right, it s still early anyway 


ten minutes later, alarm goes on again


me  there we go again, time to get it 

my mind   wow that was the fastest ten minutes in history! 

me  i know that really didn t feel like a lot of time 

my mind   see you can t even get something done in ten minutes, so why not use the time and get some rest!  

me   yes but i ve been sleeping for like 8 hours now 

my mind   well yes that s because people s needs for sleep vary from one to another  it looks like your body have special demands! 

me   i guess you re right, i wish i could be my sister, she gets by with only 5 hours of sleep  i have no idea how the heck she does that  i envy her, i really do  

my mind   see told you! you probably use your brain too much during the day so you need extra sleep to give your neurons some time to process these information  

me   omg you re probably right  alright, maybe today i l get enough sleep and then tomorrow i can get more done  besides, it s really early, who wakes ups at 7 am? only birds, but they have a mission, i don t!!!  


the amount of effort i had to endure everyday to convince myself to get out of bed was painful  i truly thought it was a global phenomenon, until i found out that there were actually people who wake up right away  it literally blew my mind and i thought what makes them get up that quick and without hesitation  


it turns out i have been training my brain for all these years to keep repeating the same pattern  the hesitation and the dwelling that i put my mind and body through isn t peculiar to waking up in the morning  i carried it away with me to almost all areas of my life and it really got me in this anxious mode of thinking and feeling  i knew i had some many decisions to make every single day, little decisions, but they take a lot of my energy  


anxiety was fed by my hesitation and fear of making decisions  i had to think a lot before i could make up my mind  my hesitation trapped my energy and aliveness  it robbed me of my respect to myself because i never felt capable enough to decide  


so whenever you take too long to make a decision, know that fear is holding you back  the longer it takes you to decide, the more you anxious you become  you feed your anxiety by hesitation and you nurture it to grow and suck life out of you  decide once and for all to never allow to live one more day and just decide  

having exciting goals is the reason i wake up everyday now  my mind does t drag me to these time wasting conversations because it s excited to get up  i don t have to think about whether or not i should get up, i just get up  i know that if i don t wake up, my goal will take longer to become real  this is the power that kicks me up and keeps me going  

next time your alarm goes on, shake off your anxiety and wake up  if you don t you ve just given it another day to live  snooze will get you to loose another opportunity to make your dream a reality  "

0,"falling into the trap of unconscious conformity 
one of the very first things i did to transform my life was to reconsider the beliefs that lead my life  going to this long unvisited territory was mind blowing to say the least  i found out i had beliefs that i unconsciously formed years ago and never even questioned ever since  

these beliefs kept me stuck in the mind of a 12 year old who s been making my life decision and choices ever since  how come i never paid attention to the amount of damage that these beliefs have caused in my life? why did i allow these lies to shape how i think, feel, and act? why have i accepted these ideas as the ultimate truth and never even questioned their validity? 

i think one key reason was what i call  unconscious conformity   throughout my life one of the driving forces has been to be like everybody else, to think what they think, to do what they do  i might have done it unconsciously most of the time because i thought why would anybody want to be different 

a key reason most of us do that is because we want others to love and accept us  so we assume that we should be like everybody else because this is the main way to get love and acceptance  we use other people s thoughts, beliefs, and experiences as reference points for us to think, belief, and act the same way 

 the problem with doing this is that we start living other people's lives rather than our own  we become versions of others echoing their thoughts, and actions  we might pretend to own these thoughts and actions as ours  but the only thing we can t pretend is how we feel deep inside about it   

i ll never forget the day when i was preparing the thesis for my masters degree and my supervisor s comment on my work  was  i don t see you in this work, i only see regurgitation of other scholars works and thoughts, where are you? what do you think?   i was too embarrassed to tell him that i don t know who i am or what to think  i ve been others long enough that i didn t even know how to be me  

using and learning from other people s thoughts, experiences, and teachings is great and it could save us a lot of time and effort because we don t have to reinvent the wheel  but using others as the only reference to build our identities and our lives is like building a sand castle  it could be knocked off in seconds because it s not built on the strong foundations of our beliefs, values, and identities  

the biggest favor you could do to yourself, your loved ones, and the whole world is to be the best version of your true self  this is where you can find genuine love and peace that lasts a lifetime and leaves a legacy that lives long after you re gone

0,"here's why it took me so long to turn my life around from the last posts on my journey out of depression and anxiety, i realized that a lot of people are struggling with the same challenges i went through back then  one thing caught my attention about some of the comments and messages i received  i realized that most of us often know that something is wrong, something needs to be done, but the majority get stuck in deciding that they re going to do something about it  so i thought of writing this post about the 3 things that held me back from doing something to figure myself and my life out  this could be helpful to people who are stuck in a situation between wanting to change and being scared of doing something to change 

1) silence is a killer

one thing i now know for sure is that had i spoken up earlier about some of the difficulties i was going through, somebody would have offered me the right help  but there are two beliefs that stopped from doing that  first, i thought that what i m experiencing is very peculiar to me and nobody else is going through the same thing  the other thing is i believed that nobody could help me because they don t know how i feel and there s nothing they could do about it 

2) pain wasn t painful enough

the roots of my anxiety and depression started to grow when i was in high school  i ve always felt something was wrong about how i feel towards events, people , and myself  at first those feelings were subtle and going on in the background  then they started to grow stronger and take the front screen of my mind  however, all this time the intensity of my emotions was not one that seriously threatened the quality if my life  that s why i never thought of something about it  the pain still wasn t painful enough for me to get up and decide to work out 

i had all the time starting from high school to fix my issues before they re too big to handle, but i never did  i let my emotional issues grow older and stronger as time passed by  but as soon as i experienced a level of pain that s life threatening, my decision was instant  i realized that if i didn t change it, my life could be the price to pay (literally and figuratively) 

at that moment, issues of years were wiped in months because i had high level of serious commitment to show up to myself, do the work, and make the change i want in my life  i knew if i waited a bit more , my loss would be bigger that it could ruin my life 

3) this belief held me back the most

the biggest barrier that held me back from doing something to change was a belief i used to have that  i can t really have what i want in life   even though i didn t verbalize that belief out loud to myself, but i really lived by it  i thought about it, heard others talk about it, and i truly bought into the idea that i had to be born a certain way to get what i wanted  so the result was that i never tried in the first place 

i have no regret what so ever for the time that took me to get to where i am today, but i truly believe that this journey could be cut very short when you become aware of the three points above  being smart is learning from other people s mistakes so that you don t have to make them yourself  it saves you ton of time, effort, and money when you r willing to listen and act on it 

so my advice to anybody who s facing similar challenges in life is to listen and act to save yourself 

feel free to ask any questions, hope this helps "

0,"2 discoveries that changed my life i have looked into the lives of people from all classes of the world 

observing the rich from a distance and tapping into the wisdom of the poor in person 

and what i have discovered is something that continues to blow my mind on a daily basis 

actually, i discovered two things 

first, i realised  that no man is never happy unless he is dominating a specific area which he is passionate about 

man is happy when he is dominating and excelling in any area of passion 

but man can only succeed if he puts in the work and time in a specific area 

this leads me to my second discovery 

wallace wattles once wrote that ""the cause of success is the man who succeeds"" 

i have realised from this statement that the true cause of success is the personality of the individual 

who you become on your journey to success is more important than success itself 

your enviroment and challenges are not the reason why you are not successful or living the life you desire 

  all these things are nothing as compared to the power that lies within a man who has conditioned himself for success in character and attitude 

and just like wallace wattles once wrote ""poverty is no barrier to greatness, for poverty can always be removed""  i also want to tell you that your enviroment and challenges are no barrier to greatness, for they can always be removed 

you can do great things despite what you facing right now

0,"my relationships didn t save me, only i did! 
lately i ve been contemplating how transforming out of depression has allowed me to get a different perspective on some of the things i used to do in my past life  depression and anxiety kept me too blind to see a lot of things that i clearly get now  being stuck in the dark caves of my own emotions held me hostage to all sorts of limiting thoughts and behaviors  

after finding my true self, i realized that i approached the majority of my relationships from one of three emotional needs  i mention them here to give anybody who s stuck in anxiety, depression, or similar unhealthy patterns of thoughts and feelings an opportunity to look at yourself through a third person lens  this might give you more awareness of the way our emotions shape our behaviors and relationships  

i ve always wondered about the formula of having successful and fulfilling relationships  i think about what makes some relationships amazingly fluffing and playful while others empty and pointless  i knew that when i figure this out, it could be a gate to one of the most precious happinesses in life  i wanted to make my relationships loving, joyful, and playful  

looking back now i can see why my relationships were not where i wanted them to be  there are many things that go into having a fulfilling relation with a partner, a family member, or a friend  but one key was how i approached my relations  i found that most of the time i entered a relation for one of 3 reasons, to get saved, motivated, or distracted  bare in mind that most of these reasons were going on in the back of my mind and unconsciously driving my relationship decisions  

1  to be saved 
i ve always felt that my life wasn t where i wanted it to be, but i didn t know what was the reason or how to put things in the right place  i got stuck in the not knowing area for a long time during which my attitude towards a relation would be to a hope to get saved by somebody else  so i always had this idea that maybe when somebody else finds out about the difficulties i m going through, maybe they ll save me and help figure things out  

2  to be motivated 
because most of the time my mode was fluctuating between anger and sadness, i thought that  it could be good to have someone to motivate me to do stuff and keep me going  so i expected my relationships to be kinda of ongoing motivational videos, i needed them to get the pump and the rush to get things done  you know, we might disappoint ourselves but it s much harder to disappoint our loved ones  

3  to be distracted 
and there also were times when relations were there to distract me from being alone and having to deal with my issues  somebody else needs me to talk, to go out, to solve a problem  so i felt needed and distracted  i no longer had to worry about how i felt or what i should do about it the most important thing is that i wasn t alone to deal with it and i was busy doing something, anything!

relations are an essential source of love and happiness when they are built for the right reasons  the minute we use them as an excuse to run away or a reason to get something, they ll become a source of pain or a barrier towards gain  

the minute i realized that i reshaped my relations and reconsidered the way i approached them  from that day on i don t feel the need to be saved, motivated, or distracted  

my advice to anyone who s having issues with a relationship is to think of why do you have the relations you have and what makes you maintain them  if your reason is to hide, i highly recommend you consider facing whatever you re running away from  it s not as scary as it sounds

0,"i owned my life when i stopped living up to people s expectations my journey to change my life started years ago when my depression took a high curve and almost cost me my life  since then i m still committed to the decision i made back then to reinvent every area of my life, and live a fulfilling life  the level of pain i hit that time of my life shock my existence to the core and brought me face to face with the hardest truth of my life  i realized i ve been living a life that didn t reflect who i truly was, or what i wanted to create out of it  i ve been living according to expectations of others and society  i decided that i no longer accept to be, think, feel, or behave as expected  this was the day i allowed myself to live a life true to myself no matter what  

working hard and being successful only to meet the expectations drained me emotionally  i used to believe that as a girl i had to hide my feelings because showing them would mean i was too weak to be perceived as successful  so i often acted as a strong person even at the times i most needed help  to me success, respect, and a good quality of life meant i had to be a certain way and keep my emotions to the side  in a modern society where there s more pressure to be, do, and have, sometimes our feminine side gets buried under pressure and work  our emotions suffer because we forget a valuable and an essential side of who we are and what we need  

living up to expectations is like wearing a mask and hiding our true identity to show somebody else that we are who they think we are  the conflict between our true identity and the fake one creates unbearable amounts of emotional pain  at a certain point our energy is drained and the mask starts to wear out  at that time we re either lucky to use the pain as a wakeup call or we let the moment pass us by and gets the best of our lives leaving us with the bitterness of regret  

years ago i was on the floor of my then one bedroom apartment all alone and crying at the lowest point of my life  back then i knew that if i let this moment pass me by without using it to turn my whole life around, i would live the rest of my life in regret (if i live at all!)  that moment defined my life and it put everything into perspective  all of a sudden, things, people, and life had a different meaning and taste  i was no longer able to live out of fear to let somebody down, instead my values, beliefs, and vision became my compass to never get lost again  

my advice to anyone who s stuck in expectations, is to free yourself out  you re far more fulfilled and useful to others when you live life according to your standards and choices  disappointing some people might be a by product at first, but the ones that truly love and care about you will get it  only then you have the power to be, and give more to yourself and to others  it s fascinating how much we re willing to do for others and not as much for ourselves  but know that if anybody deserves to be given anything, it would be you deserving freedom to live the kind of life you decide  

wish you freedom and fulfillment  
"
0,"for two months, i got my news from print newspapers  here's what i learned  "
0,"this is how my unhealthy emotions sucked life out of my relationships! hi guys, 

i read a number of posts and comments about depression and relationships  so i m writing this post to tell you my experience of how anxiety and depression made my relations suck until i figured things out  

i ve always felt like i m missing so much in my relationships because i often felt prisoned my own emotions and thoughts  i was confused most of the time because i was treating others in a way that i dreaded, and felt guilty about  i felt like i was being someone else i wasn t  angry or sad most of the time venting my emotions on the dearest people to me  

after i transformed myself out of depression i realized that it was my depression and anxiety that was driving me to behave that way  i thought and acted out of the depressed and anxious state that i was locked in  i was blind to the value of my relationships and how much happiness and fulfillment they could bring to my life if i know how to approach them out of love and joy, instead of anger and sadness  these are 3 of the most essential realizations we need to learn about to be able to build happy and fulfilling relationships that last a lifetime  

1) it s not just about me 
at the time of my depression i was constantly thinking and focusing on myself  what do i want? how do i feel? why am i having these weird thoughts at the middle of my talk with my best friend? am i gonna be depressed my entire life? i wonder if they notice that i m not myself? 

 this is not to suggest that i didn t care about others because my sense of guilt and blame meant i did  but i was thinking about myself way more and focusing on my problems, my issues, and my emotions  always worrying about what i want, what i m not getting, and how miserable my life was  

however, i found that it s key in relations to also think about the needs of other people who are sharing these relationships with you  thinking about how to help others get their emotional needs helps you cultivate the art of giving which is the essence of life  the minute you learn how to get out of your own head and give others your genuine undivided attention, the minute you ll connect with them in the most truly powerful way you ve ever had  

2) communication is key
there were many times i felt stuck in loneliness while having many family members and friends around  why didn t i reach out to anyone of them? why did i constantly held myself back from telling them what i was going through? why did it feel like pushing a very heavy rock up a mountain to talk about my depression? 

i was fighting myself, my emotions, and it brought a lot of anger and eventually resentment to my life  this made my relationships with my family or then fiancee seem very empty and at times even pointless  my phases of sadness and anger left me unable to genuinely connect with the people that mattered the most in my life  there was always this absence of true expression of feelings that kept me stuck in a shell of my own dark emotions that were eating me alive  

part of it was because i didn t know how to verbalize my feelings, so i didn t know what to say or how to approach my mom, one of my sisters, or then fiancee  they might think i m exaggerating when i say  i m depressed, i don t know what to do, and i think i need help    

another thing was that i didn t even know what exactly caused my depression and anxiety  most of the time when i intellectualize facts of my life, i don t find dramatic events that might ve caused my depression to be that severe  this would often stop me from talking because people might think i m making it up to get some attention  

what i found is that so many times our emotions get in the way of our communication  we hold ourselves back form doing something only because we re acting out of our emotional focus of the moment  when we re depressed, we approach our relationships with sadness, anger, hopelessness, or indifference  but this isn t who we truly are, it s just our emotions speaking in our behalf  

3) they expected something from me, i expected something back, and we got lost in the way (bummer) 

back then my sense of identity wasn t clear yet and so i was challenged most of the time on who i was, what i want, and what to do  i was stuck in the frame that the society and others has put me in  i was acting according to that frame, and i was feeling and behaving according to the expectations that came along with it  my unconscious feelings of confusion about who i was and what i should do with m life left me resistant and defensive most of the time  

the high expectations i had from my relationships with people often left me disappointed and hurt  i had a certain idea of what action, word, behavior, feedback, or emotion i want to get from somebody, and when that doesn t happen, i find myself falling back into deep loneliness  getting the expectation became a sign of being understood and the absence of it meant the absence of understanding  

i was operating from a belief that  people don t understand me and they can t get me   so i didn t even try to genuinely communicated with them  the truth that shifted everything (literally) to me was believing that  nobody owes me anything in life, nothing!  and acting out of this  the day i started putting that belief into action was the day i stopped having any expectations from others  

this is not out of indifference about others or not giving a shit about them  i just don t look at my relations as a trade anymore  i don t dwell upon what am i gonna get out of it, or what this person has to do to prove me anything  giving others and serving people brings far more joy, love, and satisfaction than getting from them  this is key in building healthy fulfilling relations that enrich our lives instead of making us miserable  the best thing i did was becoming more to give more, and that makes me more fulfilled than i ve ever been in my life  

now that my life is in a far better place, i can clearly see how my my depression and other limiting emotions were keeping me blind and so tunnel visioned on what i thought to be my reality  now i know i have the power to change anything in my life, i know i have the power to live the reality i choose  

learning how our emotions shape our realities and relations is a step forward towards opening ourselves to understanding and communicating with ourselves and the people we value the most in our lives  

hope this helps anybody who s challenged by depression and trying to build meaningful relationships

0," who am i?  was the first question in my journey to finding myself a few days back i wrote a post on   who are you?  is it ok if i don t know (yet)!  about how finding my identity helped with my anxiety and depression, and i got some messages asking about the process and some other details  i thought i d write this post as a follow up on the four things i wish i knew back when i was starting the process of transforming myself out of anxiety and depression  of course, you don t have to be depressed or anxious to want to figure yourself out  i found this to be a fantastic starting point to designing and living a more fulfilling life 

years ago i took the first step to change my life and put an end to the anxiety and depression that i ve lived out of for a long time  i spent a lot of time stuck in where to start from  i, then, realized that i ve always had difficulty answering essential questions like  who am i  and what do i want in life, so i decided this could be a good place to start  these are the 4 things i wish i knew back then when i was at the beginning of the quest  

1  why does it even matter to answer that question in the first place? 
sometimes i thought of this question as a philosophical approach towards life and maybe it wasn t that essential to know who i am to be happy and have a good life  until one day we were having a leadership training for graduate students and one of our colleagues came late to the session  the professor who was a leadership expert politely embarrassed the guy telling him that true leaders who are committed enough act like ones  it was a big aha moment for me to finally see the power of identity  we behave according to our identities and that s why its essential for us to answer that question to start acting according to who we truly are  

2  there are many ways to define ourselves 
one of the most common ways to define ourselves is according to our professions, our income, our possessions, our religious beliefs, our accomplishments, or even our looks  but later on i noticed that this is only the verbalized way though which we describe ourselves  however, there are more powerful but less used (or to be more accurate less outspoken) way to define ourselves such as our emotions (lover, joyful, sincere, or caring), our behavior (a lier, a gambler, a a crock, or a smoker), our self image (worthless, unique, special), or our past results  (successful, or a failure)  i know that i ve always defined myself according to my profession, and the frame i was expected to be in  even when i referred to the past i was very selective in only choosing to focus on the times i didn t get the results i wanted and defined myself as a failure  

3  our identities evolve! (i didn t know that  ) 
i ve always thought of identity as a fixed description that we sort of get stuck in and it stays with us for life  this may sound no brainer to me now that i m aware of all these aspects of my life, but back then when i defined myself as a failure (even just thinking about it), i didn t see it as something i could change or get rid of  i thought of it like a stamp that i got for a life time (even if i didn t ask for)  back then i saw myself as a pathetic, depressed, anxious, angry, and sad person who s bound to be that way for life  as such i acted out of who i was, so i was either depressed, anxious, sad, or angry at any given time (see i was committed to my identity)  

4  we have the power to reinvent who we are 
since our identities evolve, then we have the power to change them any time we decide to  quitting your job and starting a business is a change in identity  finding out your values and starting to act out of integrity instead of following the spammy trends of the market is another change in identity  so being aware that we have the power to change any disempowering side of our identities is a crucial step in getting ourselves  to behave out of our new ones   

so my advice to anyone who s about to start this journey soon is to first consider these four points before you start doing the work  the second is to be in a good mental and emotional state, to be curious about learning, and finding out more  when you try to do this out of fear, your answers might not reflect who you think you are at that time  

hope this is of value to anybody who s in search for meaning and an exit out of confusion

i see many posts from people battling anxiety and depression and going around in closed circles of mental and emotional pain  as a person who was severely depressed at a certain point of my life, i thought i d write a post about the one thing that made a huge difference in the journey of healing my anxiety and depression  i also think this could be of great help to anybody who's been stuck in limiting emotions  

i was trying to find out where depression stems from before it starts to take over my body, mind, and heart  at the beginning of my depression i used to have a lot of swinging modes from sadness, to happiness (which wasn t pure happiness either!)  sometimes the speed with which these modes change drove me insane (literally)  i would be having an amazing time with a friend, a family member, or even by myself, then the next thing i know is that i m feeling depressed  

because i m an intellectually open person, i was willing to consider all sorts of possibilities and explanations for these swinging modes  i started experimenting with some ways to monitor my mind and my emotions to arrive at the reason for these modes  i so much wanted to find out where depression comes from  

then one day i was having a good time with a friend when she started telling me about how worried she was for the future of her children if her husband didn t get the position in that big corporation  it suddenly grabbed my attention that it all starts from thoughts  i started to recall the times when i experienced these swinging modes, and i noticed that the one thing that shifted my mode was a thought  when a certain thought took the center stage of my mind, the result is either happiness or depression  

mostly these thoughts were either about the past or the future  when i think about something not very pleasant that happened tome in the past, i automatically feel depressed because i feel like i have no power to change it  when i become worried about how something would turn out to be in the future i again get into the depression mode  

 
at first i dismissed this explanation, but when i put it to practice, it proved to be very effective in stimulating or shifting my depression emotions  the speed with which these thoughts were taking over my mind was absolutely fascinating and scary at the same time  i could be be doing ok one minute and the next i want to crawl back in my bed, and it s all because of a thought! 

at first i tried to track my thoughts, and of course it didn t work out because i m having a gazillion thought every minute  so i decided to go the other way around and start with the end in mind  my emotions became the compass that directed my thoughts, not the other way around  i decided what i want to feel, and started having thoughts that generated this feeling for me  

emotions and thoughts are two major powers that shaped my experience with depression and anxiety  taking inventory of my life started by leading my emotions and thoughts instead of having them lead me  

hope you find this of value  feel free to ask any questions, happy to help anytime

i ve come across many posts and comments from people who are going through different types of emotional challenges  i noticed that a common theme between many of these posts and comments is a sense of loss, and confusion about one s self  it seems that the loss of clarity about who we are is a pain point that s causing our emotions to put us through a constant battle that drains our energy  so, i thought i d point out how finding my true identity helped me in healing anxiety and depression  

long ago my sister fell off the stairs and hit her head pretty bad that she suffered from temporary memory loss  she couldn t  remember who we are, who she was, or any other details about her life at all  she was scared and even though physically her life wasn t in danger, but the psychological effect of the accident was getting the best of her  

it was both scary and fascinating to watch her navigate her way through all the overwhelm and confusion of her emotions  she had us, her family and friends, but yet fear and confusion was all i could see in her eyes and face  

years ago when my anxiety and depression was the worst it got in my life, i remembered that accident  i felt the same fear and confusion that i had seen in my sister s eyes  even though i hadn t lost my memory, but it felt like my loss wasn t any less painful  i had absolutely no clue who i was, i had no sense of direction, and i felt that everything that could possibly connect me to this life was outside my reach  it was all circumstances, things, conditions, or labels that dictated how i think, how i feel, and what i did  

suddenly i could see myself in my sister s body and feel the pain of losing her identity  i finally realized that almost all the things that made me who i was didn t come from deep within  my body, my sex, my job, my relationships, my political tendencies, my hobbies, and the material things i own are not who i truly am  i finally grasped the reality that none of this matters if it s not a reflection of my true identity and if it doesn t flow from within   

the things my sister needed back then were love, security, and compassion  that was the language she understood when no words seemed to comfort her pain  these were the emotions that shaped her experience and brought her back to life  all she was vanished in a minute and was quickly restored once we knew what she needed the most, love 

on the day i was shocked to contemplate ending my life, i realized the one thing that could bring me back to the safe shore of myself was to find my true identity  i knew life would be meaningless unless i know who i am and what i want out of it  anxiety and depression were a signal that i was mentally and emotionally lost, and i had to find myself to put them to sleep once and for all   

beliefs, thoughts, values, and emotions were the vehicle i used to arrive at the safe destination of my true self  

if you re stuck where i used to be, i recommend you start there  

hope this could be of value to you in your journey  feel free to ask any questions, i m always happy to help

0,"3 key things that finally turned it around for me hi guys,
 
been seeing a lot of posts from people challenging anxiety, depression, and the rest of the package that comes with it (self doubt, low self esteem, negative self talk, etc )  i thought i d just point out the top 3 key things that turned my anxiety and depression (as well as some other emotional negative package!) 
 
a quick background, i have been suffering from anxiety and depression for as far as i remember  over the years it took so many forms and translated into different physical and emotional symptoms (stomach aches, negative relation with food, and general exhaustion)  i had emotional swinging modes of sadness, anger, and hopelessness  during my study years, i had difficulty focusing and usually got interrupted by daydreaming (was told to have adhd and dyslexia!) 
 
few years ago, i was in a work trip abroad and my depression had reached the top it ever got in my life  i started contemplating ending my life, and even though i didn t attempt or consider actually doing it  i was shocked because i never thought the idea could even cross my mind, and so this was the alarm that got me dead serious about figuring my shit out 
 
so i thought i would give you a quick summary of the top 3 things that were key in turning everything in my life around (that includes my body, my relations, and my work)  i just want to say that there is never one thing that has the absolute answer, but the combination of these steps made the huge difference i ve always been looking for (of course there s more into it than these 3 steps, but these were the best start)
 
1)         where does it all start
 
during my depression and anxiety time i found it very difficult to make decisions  i spend a long time trying to get a lot of information, thinking, and over analyzing things  even the smallest types of decisions (like ordering a food at a restaurant, or a piece of clothes) would take me long to  finally decide  i used to ponder a lot and think about whether this decision is the right one or is it yet another mistake  i d also worry about what others think of my decisions, and so i d ask most of the people around me about what they think  i was also worried about failing because what would that would make me 
 
there s nothing wrong with asking for opinions, and getting some background information  however, excessively doing that drained me of two essential things  energy and self confidence  i realized that i weigh people s opinions against mine and gradually that left me dependent on others  suddenly, i realized that most of the things i ve done in my life were directly or indirectly the result of social and environmental pressures  my clothes, my education, my profession, and the nature of my relations are nothing but clear representations that my decisions were not entirely mine 
 
so i started reading and studying more about how we make decisions, and what are some of the decisions that i could make to completely change my life  i suddenly realized that everyday i make millions of tiny decisions that could completely change my life if i become more conscious about how i make them  the decision to eat healthy rather than junk, the decision to exercise instead of watching tv, the decision to work on a side project rather than surfing the internet, the decision to wake up early rather than hitting the snooze button  all these might be small decisions but they shape my life and they make me the person i am  my life is shaped by the decisions i make everyday  so, i chose to save my emotional, mental, and physical energy by deciding once and for all to win the game and build the kind of life i want to live  most people spend their entire lives without making that decision, and they continue to exist in the no man land (swinging and hanging in between) 
 
2)         some people live and die without figuring this out
 
it s funny how sometimes the most important moments in our lives are so little that it could be so easy to miss when we re not paying attention  we were having a sports leader training for a volunteer event when one of the coaches asked us to do an exercise in pairs  the name of the exercise was  who are you?!   i was back to back with one of my mates when we started asking each other the  who are you question?  each time we were supposed to give a new answer 
 
most of the people in the room answered the question referring to things like their jobs, relationships, sexes, religions, hobbies, sports activities, nationalities, political ideologies, or even pets  it suddenly hit me that all these things were actually circumstances, and none of them reflected who we truly were  i thought what if i lose my memory tomorrow? would that mean i m no longer who i am, then who do i become?
 
this is one of the reasons that drag people into pain when they lose any of these circumstances  i realized that our identities is hugely attached to what we have, and what we do, but not as much to who we truly are  i came to know that who i am has nothing to do with my job, my relations, or my appearance, but it has everything to do with my beliefs, values, and emotions 
 
at the end of the day we all want what we want because we want to feel something out of it  customer psychology revealed that people don t buy products, but they buy identities  we buy a certain brand show to feel a certain way  this is not only peculiar to buying, but to most of the decisions we make in our lives  we get married (normally), have kids, have friends to feel loved, cared for, and appreciated  the basis that we use to make our decisions are beliefs, values, and emotions 
 
3)         always looking, don t know for what! 
 
it used to annoy me when i walk into a store and a salesperson ask me, so  what are you looking for today?   it s a simple example, but it s a critical one and it used to happen to me a lot  most of the time i had no idea what i was looking for and what i really wanted in life  when i was at school, and somebody ask me this silly question of  what do you want to be when you grow up?  and because i was too embarrassed to say  i don t know! , i d say something like like the rest of my mates  i wanna be a doctor  , truth is i didn t!
 
most of my life i didn t know what i wanted to be, have, do, feel, be with  i just didn t know! so when i made the decision to change my lief, i figured that the first thing i needed to find out was what i wanted to be, have, do, and feel in all areas of my life 
 
so one day i sat down and i wrote everything i wanted in life  starting from my body, my relations, my work, my mission in life, my emotions, finance, travel and fun  i asked myself  who do i want to be? what do i want to do, and have?  i decided to design my life the way people design their homes  i consciously pick emotions, thoughts, experiences, people, and things i want to have  
 
it s a true pleasure for me to wake up in the morning knowing that i have the power over how i want to feel, think, and do in my life no matter what happens 
 
these strategies didn t develop overnight and they don t come in default mode, but now because this is how i live day to day, they become my second nature  i don t fight over to do the work because this is who i am now  i just flow out of my nature 
 
hope this helps anybody who wants to make a true change and own their lives  happy to help out with any questions

now imagine those friends are your goals

know that once you achieve the goal, you ll miss the process, you ll miss the hardship, that brought enjoyment in your life

1,how you would crave for them if they were not yours  
1,"can you be stoic and a nihilist at the same time? hello 

when it comes to morality and the value of life, to me it only comes down to how much you value it  a kind of subjectivism  

proponents of the is ought say you can't derive morality from how something is  morals have changed through history and were not set in stone, so how can you argue for moral objectivty? or argument from nature, in psychopaths nature there is a lack of empathy, but it's his nature  

nature it self seems cruel, look at things as parasitic wasps, what did the caterpillar do to them to deserve that? 

or things from my own case, the genetic flaws, i was born with them  the only thing that could have been done here is for my parents to see they have flawed genetics and not to reproduce  

but then again bashing your head about this does not yeild any results  that is where stoicism comes in 

accept the fact and try to improve what you can  that is the greatest merit of stoicisim to me  

what i don't agree with is holding out for things like virtues, to benefit the society  i did not give consent to be born in the first place  

for example, i want to die by suicide  it's not something that i had in a emotional break down, i was born broken  i may not have terminal diagnosis, but all of my conditions require me to focus 100  on my health and build everything around it  

nietzsche said, if one can't get to ones goal of life because of health, suicide is a way to go  

stoics were also for it, as a user pointed in my last post here  you just said that, if i am unsure that is a sign i am not ready for it and that i have duties to others, the latter, no i don't  only in the case of kids i made and that is not the case, it's one of the reasons why i was, am and will be childfree  the former, can be debated "
1,"holding resentments or judges  

 gt  resentment is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die  

all people have flaws and do acts on unkindness in their life  it is also an act of unkindness not to forgive people  if one is truly either naive or regretted, i should forgive him for he has not the knowledge i possess 

if one eats the wrong way, don t bother yourself trying to teach him for no reason  however, eat the right way  it s not worth teaching anyone anything they are convinced they are doing it right  you can, however, suggest  if they don t care, they don t care  and neither should you  don t repeat what you said or level up your voice because someone isn t following your rules os conduct principles of life  you, however, should follow them accordingly "

reading through marcus aurelious and realising myself that complaining would do nothing for me, was able to endure the pain throughout the couple of weeks that it affected me 

body started to heal but guess will have some nice marks that could lead to some interesting stories 

complaining about anything will never lead to any sort of solution 

fight those feelings and move straight through   be that all consuming flame that burns brighter no matter what gets thrown your way "

1,"(paraphrased) ""act now because you may lose your mind  not necessarily due to old age, but rather you may succumb to pleasure "" marcus aurelius warns himself that today he is a philosopher, but he could succumb to pleasure  

this quote hit close to home  i have found myself be productive for months straight, only to find myself procrastinating months later 

as a side note, there are passages that talk about patience, this shouldn't be taken to extremes 

do not wait, now is the time "
1,how do stoics deal with constant daydreaming about living a different life than one currently has? 
1,"gay stoics   the velvet rage today i found a surprisingly stoic book on the emotionally destructive effect of internalised childhood shame in gay men  the book is a passionate and beatifully written set of accounts of gay men struggling to come to terms with their emotional wounds  written and narrated by alan downs, a clinical (gay) psychologist who believes in the power of dialectic behavioural therapy (dbt), a branch of psychology similarly to cbt and hence stoic in essence 

 i wanted to share this hidden gem with anyone interested in tsiloring their own stoic practice for self acceptance and or understanding of the lgbtq  community 

quotes from book 

 gt  the damaging part of learning to live your life in two parts , whether in reality or fantasy, cannot be underestimated  it is an infectious skill that you learned, one that would eventually spread beyond the bedroom of your life  life wasn't ever what it seemed on the surface  nothing could be trusted for what it appeared to be  after all, you weren't what you appeared to be  in learning to hide part of yourself, you lost the ability to trust anything or anyone fully  without knowing it, you traded humane innocence for dry cynicism 

 gt  contentment is created when your behaviour is consistent with your values  when you act in ways that are consistent with the core of who you are, even when your actions aren't approved by others, you increase your overall contentment  happiness, success, money, relationships, and even the approval of others will come and go in your life, but what is ultimately satisfying is feeling content "
1,"on permanence and reason  gt he who has vehement desire for posthumous fame does not consider that every one of those who remember him will himself also die very soon  then again also they who have succeeded them, until the whole remembrance shall have been extinguished as it is transmitted through men who foolishly admire and perish  

   marcus aurelius, meditations, book iv   19

aurelius likes to go back to this theme of endless time and oblivion  memento mori, or remember that you will die is a common saying  nothing is permanent  your problems, life, legacy, not even the universe is permanent 

i started thinking about this a lot when i started to do things for the permanence of it, like journaling, writing letters, or getting a tattoo  and i guess in this age, anything you do or say on the internet is permanent now  we seem to be obsessed with leaving a mark, recording our lives, leaving a legacy in this world when our time is up  people always want to leave the world a better place than how they found it  they want to be remembered  but why? like marcus aurelius said, memento mori  nothing is permanent 

 amp  x200b 

permanence

it s a funny word actually, is anything really permanent? we tend to refer to permanence with respect to something else    an interval of time, usually of a human lifespan (i e  scars, tattoos, etc)  what about ideas? stories and philosophy? myths, legends, and knowledge go back thousands of years, so they re permanent, right? well yes, but only with respect to our species  

we can go even deeper and say that matter and time aren't permanent either because it's only with respect to our universe (time not existing before big bang) 

if life isn t permanent, then clearly death is  death is permanent   isn t it? 

well, only with respect to the linearity of time  humans are 3 dimensional beings, where time only goes in one direction  but if we try to think bidirectionally and if we define death as unconscious nonexistence, then wouldn t that mean we were dead before we were born? if time went backwards, then life would come from death  benjamin button style  death would, therefore, not be permanent according to the universe  the only permanent thing is impermanence 

well if nothing is permanent and we all die in the end, then what s the point of life? seems pretty nihilistic  who cares, right? we all die, nothing matters  that s a pretty shit way to live life    without meaning or purpose 

 amp  x200b 

marcus aurelius s original intent behind his theme on permanence was likely in the context of  detachment from things  from possessions, fame, fortune    that kind of permanence  for when your favorite mug breaks or a pandemic strikes, or losing a loved one  

but for the type of permanence that that i'm getting at, seneca s letters from a stoic can help us answer that question  in seneca s 65th letter he kind of delves into permanence in a long, convoluted way  

 amp  x200b 

reason

in this letter he and some friends are debating the root causes of all thing, they used a sculptor and his statue as an example  in this discussion seneca analyzes the thinking of aristotle and plato  aristotle says there are four causes  matter, the workman, the form, and the purpose of the work as a whole  plato adds a 5th cause to this  the pattern or  the idea  

seneca disagrees and argues that there is only one cause, something that supersedes all other cause with no dependence on matter or time  something that is truly permanent  and that one sole thing, is creative reason or logos 

i didn t understand this at first and i still don t but as i thought about it, i went back to my original question of, ""what is permanent?"" are the laws of physics permanent? well only with respect to our universe  physics could be different in other universes  ok what about math? and then that s where it hit me  

math  is 1 1 2 permanent? our ability to perform basic arithmetic or our logic logos is our ability to reason  other universes may have different physics, dimensions or representations of logic, but the underlying foundation of math and logic are absolute and immutable  reason describes the structure of truth  

 amp  x200b 

conclusion

it makes sense that stoicism is a philosophy based upon logic and reason  it s the one thing that makes us human  it s what gives our life meaning  our reason and purpose in everything that we do is what matters  not the outcome or external things that result from it  sisyphus pushing a boulder up a hill just to have it roll back down again every day represents our lives  it s meaningless  but sisyphus rolling up that boulder with purpose and focusing on that one task every day with a smile on his face is what gives life meaning

1,"15 points that compress so much (for me) i am sure none of this is earth shattering, but it rocked me as a bunch of pieces all fell into place as i was showering one day 

what follows is the sudden product of a long journey of journalling, reading and thinking  it will not map as vividly to your own mindset and precepts as it did mine 

as such, i offer it here in hope it can be a useful schema in your own development  so, in 15 points 

1  you will tend to regret (or regret more) the things you did not do 

2  therefore it always makes sense to do the right kind of things 

3  the right kind of things are the inklings, hopes and notions in your mind that are recurrent, stable and persistent yet rarely engrossing or distracting 

4  this is because these things come from the stable and long term aspects of your character, not your moment to moment lusts or hungers 

5  when you undertake the right kind of action, the consequences   good or bad   will make sense because they will accord with your values  you may invite grief by acting thus, but the grief will be meaningful 

6  as you conduct yourself this way, the proportion of your life that is meaningful to you will increase in line with how much of it is the consequence of your previous values based choices 

7  given all this, it is imperative you find   or find signs of   your values as soon as possible 

8  and then begin acting on these as soon as possible afterwards 

9  always with a mind to know them more precisely as you evolve and your values become clearer 

10  because, like it or not, your life circumstances are the product of your previous choices 

11  because, whether or not you're aware of it, the older you get, the more of your life is the product of your past choices 

12  it is thus wisdom and maturity to accept this and accept that you are responsible for all the of the reasonably foreseeable consequences of your actions 

13  thus it makes sense to seek to live without regrets   both of action and omission 

14  yet, as no one is all knowing, senseless hazard will still visit upon your wise life 

15  but, if you have enough wisdom, any turbulence will be a minor and temporary, lost in the vast calm of that is the estate of a wise life 

 amp  x200b 

these and the relationships between them are still under development on this end  nevertheless, done is better than perfect, and i hope some of the above is useful in your pursuit of wisdom "
1,"abandoned messages on social media ah, many times i started writing a paragraph to someone about how strongly i remembered this single thing they said years ago, and how i made that a part of my own, and how much a difference it had made to my life  how fondly i remember my time with them as classmates, colleagues, or just as friends, and how it soothed the passing of time  how, alongside splitting the bill for a lunch held thirty minutes ago, i would like to tell them how much i enjoyed it, how it refueled me with much needed joy to share spaghetti with them 

and how many times i ve abandoned those messages  how i d just stick to the formal part  splitting the bill or silence altogether  because i d be certain they wouldn t remember such a moment or didn t catch the feeling  unsure whether i could say such a thing, because it s not something people do   so out of the blue, so unsolicited  i d convince myself it s better to delete what i just wrote and forget about it 

and in such a moment i d lose that opportunity of friendship 

because every time i  did  proceed sending such messages, it brought joy to the person whom i was grateful for   which brought even more joy to me "
1,"what would a stoics view be on dealing with crappy people involved in child s life? i m going through a divorce and it s been incredibly painful  my soon to be ex husband has turned into a completely cold and hateful person towards me  ive accepted i can t control that, but i can t seem to wrap my head around another issue  

he and my friend, who was also our neighbor, had an affair  she was never a good friend, she was also never a great person  so, i am not terribly surprised but it hurt all the same  neither of them care  they are both pretty inconsiderate, selfish people and they really don t care about others feelings, only their own  

they are now together and in our custody stipulation it says that we shall not introduce the kids to any significant other until they ve been together 6 months  so, in 6 months, i m sure she ll make her way around the kids and i can t help but be insanely worried about that  i don t want her around the kids  it makes me feel incredibly uneasy, and i know i can t do anything about that  so my question is    what would a stoics approach be here? i know i have control over being a great mom, and i ll never stop being exactly that  but what can i do here? what should i do?"
1,"stoicism on attachment i just posted one about sex, which got me thinking about attachment, as i am currently struggling with feeling attached to a girl who just broke my heart  i am new to stoicism, and a lot of my recent studies have helped distract me from my pain  but i guess i'm just asking

1,"stoicism and christianity i am new to this sub, so i apologize if this topic has already been discussed in depth  

i consider myself a christian  i do not attend church, but i believe in the teachings of jesus and striving to lead a virtuous life while treating others with love and respect  i am also somewhat new to stoicism, but i am drawn to many of its teachings as well 

my main question  is it possible to lead a life following the teachings of jesus, and also as a stoic? the key difference i see is that christianity teaches you to seek god for help during crisis, whereas stoicism teaches you to look within yourself and realize what you can and cannot control  perhaps i m thinking about this incorrectly, or these two ideas are not mutually exclusive  i d love some insight from those more versed in stoicism than me 

more specifically  i ve read letters from a stoic and meditations so far  i very much enjoyed meditations  christianity was young during marcus s reign  how did he view the new religion? did he support persecution of early christendom as some previous rulers had? based on his writings, i have a hard time believing he would tolerate harsh treatment of other humans (except perhaps where their behavior violated roman law)  i also think that biblical authors who lived during the time of rome would have been aware of stoicism, and probably applied it to their lives as well  there are multiple scriptures that seem to represent a stoic philosophy

1,"food for thought read!!!! marcus aurelius's meditations have surfaced again in my mind  and i got to say, i had an almost eureka moment  there is this passage that reads, "" body, soul, mind  to the body belongs sense perceptions, to the soul impulses, and to the mind judgements "" now there is always this saying that one must conquer the mind before one can conquer the body  while this is true, often times the soul is left out of the equation  as a christian myself, i know that soul is our true pure essence  that when we die, everything else stays on earth but our soul  if i believe that as many do too, then if impulses belong to the soul, then our impulses to do wrong, think ill of others, and other shitty stuff, our body which receives sense perceptions facilitate this and we act wrongly  but this is where the mind comes in  the mind that owns judgement, then we have the ability to say no, as hard as that may be  turn away from it,  it causes harm  then slowly but surely, our soul will not be as corrupted because you abstain from those acts, thoughts or whatever else  and soon enough this will train the body to look at provocative, seductive things and not get a reaction from you because your soul is cleansing itself while your ""directing mind"" is judging for you  so what we have to practice and master is controlling your mind  once you do that, whatever bad impulse the soul sends through your sense perceptions (body), the mind can say no! and counteract such impulse, and as a result your soul will slowly shy away from that and will return to what the ""gods"" wanted  a virtuous life  i do not know if this made sense at all, but i hope to at least get your minds thinking about this "

my schedule is usually working around 20 hours a day, with 4 hours to sleep on the good days  i have no free time to relax or do any activities outside of hospital stuff, and while inside the hospital i am at the bottom of the food chain and am basically treated like shit  have been called anything from a retard to  we don t see you as a human, first year residents are more like ants, you just have to go and work   

with every day that passes i feel worse, more tired, my mind feels like it s ready to break at any moment  you can t whine or complain cause that only makes it worse, and if you don t like it  you are always free to quit   which i don t want to do because the hospital i am at is probably the best to learn, but you need to survive this first year 

i ve been trying to keep in mind things like memento mori but it doesn t help much  if i knew i was to die tomorrow would i be doing this? hell no  it s an investment  the investment to be a top orthpaedics surgeon  the hardest investment i ve done 

i need ideas to maintain a better attitude and basically to not want to fucking die half the time, which is hard on the days when you ve slept less than 3 hours, haven t showered in two days, haven t had time to brush your teeth, and one of your superiors comes and tell you that you are a lazy piece of shit because you didn t do the one thing they asked you to do (while still having 100 other things to do )

 just because my parents don t understand my outlook on life, doesn t mean they re right or wrong  only different 

 i am in charge of my philosophical journey  if i am going to grow, i must take the steps that lead me to the destination i want to arrive at 

 just because i can t find or don t have a mentor, doesn t mean i can t continue to learn and grow  

 resenting the past isn t changing it  i need to learn to change how i judge past events 

 i understand the concept of judgment value, i need to learn how to practice and apply changing the value of my judgements 

 i don t need to be anxious about believing differently from my friends  their beliefs are not in my control, nor are mine in theirs  they accept me for who i am and i shouldn t ask for any more 

 just because i feel incompetent doesn t mean that the work i ve done the knowledge i do have isn t worthless  

 i must continue to remind myself that pure happiness isn t the goal, contempt and virtue is 

 i need to learn to love myself so that i can move on to loving others in a way that isn t crutched by self loathing  

 no matter how long my relationship with my best friend has lasted, it is entirely possible for him to outgrow me  that is not in my hands, so it s ok

1,"the daily stoic and ryan holiday  their unstoic unreliability long story short  they took my money, never delivered my order, apologised for their mistake and said they would issue a refund, and then have proceeded to completely ghost me while never delivering their promise for a refund 

here's a timeline of the events  

  oct 18th    item ordered 

  dec 3rd    i send them a mail asking what happened with my order, and whether they haven't forgotten about it 

  dec 5th    since i never received a mail saying they shipped the item, i ask them to cancel the order altogether because i know longer want it 

  dec 9th    i send them another mail asking if i'm to assume that i'll be seeing neither my money nor the item i ordered, because of their total silence on the matter 

they reply back on the same day with this 

 gt  we sincerely apologize for the delay here  it looks like we missed your initial inquiries and have received your most recent email  we had some fulfillment issues with a previous fulfillment center we are no longer working with which caused a delay miscommunication about your order  we are working on getting tracking for your order now and would be happy to issue a refund for the shipping cost of your order as the very least  however if you still wish for a full refund, we completely understand  please let us know if you would prefer the full refund at this time or if you have any additional questions  thank you and we hope to hear from you soon!

i then reply positively, thanking them for the offer to refund the shipping cost, and ask them when i might realistically expect to receive the item 

  dec 14th    i send them a mail, asking them if my mail got through  i'm wondering about this, because in the one and only reply i ever received from them, they alluded to not receiving my other mails and only receiving the latest 

  dec 16th    due to the ongoing total silence, i let them know that i want them to cancel the order altogether and issue a full refund 

  everyday from this point on, once a day  , i have been sending small one line emails, hoping that they are ignoring me not out of malice but by a genuine technical error of some sort due to which they are somehow not receiving my emails 

  other steps i have taken to try to contact them    

  tried dming both ryan holiday and daily stoic on instagram, but i assume that they probably get flooded with dms which is why they never opened my messages 

  tried forwarding the email thread both to ryan holiday's gmail address, as well as to the other daily stoic contact mail address (""info"" rather than ""store"")  

  tried contacting  u ryan_holiday directly on reddit, both with a dm and a comment mention, assuming that he probably receives way less notifications on reddit than he does on instagram so i should have a fair chance of obtaining some kind of response this way  but no  he was active in the last day as his post history shows, which is honestly making me wonder whether or not i am being ghosted intentionally  still, i am patient, assuming outstanding incompetence and failure to do good, rather than unstoic ill intentions to steal  

i am running out of ideas on what to do  got any tips? 

some of you might want to tell me that money is an external, that it's no big deal, that i should just let go of my 44 dollars and take it as a lesson not to get tricked into buying overpriced trinkets (though my initial intention was to thank the daily stoic by buying their merchandise, rather than seeing value in the merchandise itself  obviously i've lost that feeling towards them now)  

  to these people i reply that it's not the money that is my concern, but justice   

i'm not angry, i'm not all that attached to the lost money, even though i would of course prefer it if i got it back  my main desire right now is to encourage justice, to encourage standards of behaviour, especially coming from people who claim to follow stoic principles  

whether ill intentions or outstanding incompetence, the daily stoic ought to hang their heads in shame for how they are (not) dealing with my situation "
1,"grateful just wanted to share that stoicism has helped me alot  in the past years, i ve always been the anxious person whose always afraid of anything  i m not always good with handling difficult people and situations but upon reading about stoicism and slowly applying it to my life, my fears have decreased even if the challenges that i m facing is still the same  i became more grateful about life and finding my own peace which is rare  in the next year, i plan to continue my stoicism journey and hopefully strengthen my new found values and principles "
1,"my mental framework, a bit similar to stoicism when i was a teen, i looked at my life as a sine wave(like this     )  my explanation was that, if my pursual of happiness success was large, the level of anguish hurt disappointment would be large too  so i mentally recalibrated myself to not pursue anything too much  to not be obsessed  to passively react instead of actively engage  

in my 20s i got a bit more ambitious  i opened myself up a bit and pursued a few things more seriously  even then, i never dived deep into almost any aspects of my life, career, relationships etc  i was always as close to the surface as i could, so that if something went wrong, i could pull myself out of the water quickly  i always had and have an escape route  

i also make it a point to never celebrate success so that i would be able to endure failure  

i don't really know if my mental framework is right  don't know how to measure it's worthiness  

i don't really know what made me adopt this approach  may be it's a coping mechanism to too many disappointments growing up? i did do something as a teen which left me a lot ashamed with my friends though

i get it and it makes perfect sense

i'm posting here to reaffirm the stoic belief that we control our own responses to external situations  in my mind, today and tomorrow are like any other day    i do not need a calendar to tell me when to celebrate life or to be thankful  those are attitudes i can enact on any day 

so, for those who might find this holiday season to be tough and rough, i hope this thought offers some solace  the public response in recent months to restrictions around halloween, thanksgiving, and now christmas are all about responding to external sources of meaning (i e , tradition)  in times such as ours, we must be critical of how much meaning we  choose  to give these aspects of our lives

2) ban images again  

3) allow filtering between two sensibly chosen flairs  (for technical reasons, users are pretty much limited to selecting either one flair, or everything, to view) 

i think the flair option can be good if we get the flair right  here's a few ways we might do it 

1) beginner   advanced

2) inspiration   discussion

3) image   text

4) offer a single flair  ""classical stoicism""

i start thinking about them with victim mentality and get depressed  it can ruin my days  music rarely cheers me up 

i don't know what to do anymore  i tried avoiding music altogether, but at the end began listening to music again  no matter how hard i try to avoid being triggered by music, it happens 

i even sometimes listen to music with an ""indirect"" intention of feeling that way   which is not healthy and i regret it afterwards, but do it again  it can distract me from doing daily tasks and studying sometimes

1,"the holidays are super stressful and at times depressing during a good year let alone 2020  i've added a few tips which help me make the most of the season, hope this perspective helps! for me, reducing stress, anxiety, and depression during this holiday season is about eliminating negative toxic influences and replacing them with positive and healthy ones  it also helps by staying present within awareness and being grateful for all that i have    without comparing what i had or what i did to celebrate the holidays last year   this is vital to ensuring my peace and joy through the season and beyond  

for instance, i can't travel to be with my family this year so i will do a zoom call    which is lame and depressing in comparison  so to help make it interesting i'll make the zoom call more fun by playing games with my fam, (jackbox, quiplash, etc ) and putting the screen on my family room tv so i feel like they're with me instead of on my cell phone screen  it's not about which is better, being with them in person or on a webinar, but making the most of my circumstance and adapting    finding the light so to speak and residing within the positivity of that adaptation    and going one step further and being grateful for it! many people will not even have the opportunity to have a zoom call with their family, i will  this is a blessing  

anywho, i just released a new video on yt sharing ten tips to help us all make the most of this holiday season  these tips will also help us just feel better by eliminating some stress and anxiety and help decrease the loneliness and  depression  i'm wishing you all a very peaceful and joyous holiday season!

1,"proposed rule change discussion thread the mod team has received a lot of feedback recently, and we have two groups of people here who are unhappy with the current situation  on the one side, we have folks are are dismayed at the proliferation of less serious posts, often image based, which seem to have displaced the more focused discussions of the past  on the other, we have a much larger community of people who are annoyed at what they perceive as nitpicking rules that cause many of the most popular posts to be taken down, even when these posts have generated useful discussion  the more we try to navigate the middle road, the more annoyance we seem to generate from both sides 

flairs were mentioned as a possible solution to the problem, which would hopefully allow users to filter posts and focus only on what they want 

the main obstacle to this approach is that reddit's implementation of flair filtering is poor, and only really works nicely for filtering one sort of flair at a time  happily, it turns out that this can work to our advantage 

our proposal is to require posts be tagged with one of only two available flairs     image media  , or   text    image media will include direct links to any media, including gifs, video, music, etc  text will be text posts, which may include embedded links to whatever we would normally allow 

users can gracefully filter out one or the other with a single click, and they can bookmark the resulting url   you can just click on any tag now to see how it works  (users of ""old reddit"" can use this functionally too, but in a slightly  less graceful way ( most apps support this single flair filtering as well 

the relevance rules could be applied with a somewhat lighter hand to the image posts, allowing more general content while still disallowing memes, unattributed quotes, and stuff that's really off topic or low effort  our rules will be applied more strictly to text posts 



this is not a bad idea, and crucially, we do not have a lot of other good ideas for how to make both groups happy 

let us know what you think, how we might alter this idea, or what else we might consider  a community vote on the resulting proposal will follow shortly 

thanks "

1,"the shortcut to virtue  dichotomy of necessity epictetus called the cynic way shortcut to virtue, as it was an intense regime of asceticism and poverty meant to test a person's resistance and commitment to a strong character  however, merely practicing poverty isn't really what is meant by virtue, it's the underlying principle that has the key meaning  a cynic isn't poor merely to be poor,  the cynic practices what i call the dichotomy of necessity  diogenes was said to have gotten rid of his wooden cup after seeing a kid drink water with his hands cupped  it was unnecessary, thus a burden  

this is the real practice that catapults people into wisdom  knowing what is necessary from what is superfluous  what is required from what is unnecessary  what is meaningful from what is vapid  this applies to all the things within your control  you already know how to separate what is up to you from what isn't   now you can learn what is necessary from what can be discarded, omitted, and ignored  

you're not going to abandon everything, wear a sack, and live homeless  what you will gain is the awareness of how much of your time and attention is spent on things you could absolutely do without that you thought mattered more than they did  and if you so choose to spend that time, or money, or keep those possessions be prepared to say ""this is my vanity, i keep this out of complacency"" in order to keep yourself honest  no need to make excuses, it's your self indulgence, nothing else  with time, if you keep your honesty about what you don't need, it will come undone painlessly "

yesterday i journaled about my wish for a car  today i am grateful for my life in general  although humans tend to want more and more, this will never suffice  we simply want more if we don t train our brains to think properly, naively thinking materialism will suffice for our despair and unhappiness 

notice on how good you live, to be able to connect to me from all the parts of the globe, to be able to take an antibiotic if you catch a disease that would likely kill you 200 years ago, to celebrate christmas and have food at the table, to be able to read and educate yourself, and so on 

not so long ago, kings would not have plumbing in their facilities, something for us that seems pretty basic and we take that for granted  in terms of material possessions, we have so much  my life is the dream life of millions of people in, say, the past (if time travel was possible) and in more impoverished countries  

i recognise we should be more thankful for what we have for others have wished it much more  don t think for what you don t have  rather, try negative visualisation and imagine not having the things you have and how you would be that way  be thankful  take 1 minute of your day and use negative visualisation  then stop, and smile for what you have imagined is not true for you, but it is for many other people  know that

in my opinion, each and every stoic philosopher has important teachings  as seneca says, it is the forest of wisdom that is to our benefit  how can we distinguish one tree from the other when we are looking to absorb the fresh air of the entire forest? we can t  however, if i were somehow limited to only one master to study for the rest of my life, or just one teacher to recommend to prokoptons new and old, it would undoubtedly be epictetus  not just because he s funny (seriously   out of 30 40 original philosophical works i have read, there are    only two    other ones that made me laugh out loud the way the epictetus s discourse and enchiridion did), but because epictetus cuts right to the heart of what stoicism is about  control what you can as ardently as you can, and forget about the rest  this is from his discourses ii 16 2

2020 has objectively been one of the harshest years in our modern history  between political turmoil, huge forest fires on two continents, civil unrest in many western countries (usa and france leading the way) and   oh yeah that covid thing, 2020 has impacted everyone in the world to varying degrees  we have all faced challenges, and even the most stoic (adverb, not philosophy) of us felt a deluge of negative emotions, depression, anxiety, fears, etc 

having feelings, anxieties etc is a normal part of being human  as much as we try to focus on the rational mind, we exist in these imperfect and all too easily fallible vessels that react emotionally to external stimuli  so we can t be upset over what we felt during the year   what we did when we were emotional   times we were not virtuous  we can t control these anymore than we can control blinking  moreover, all these moments of ignobility are in the past  both the body s reactions and our past choices are in the domain of that which is not dependent on us  externals 

by definition (as epictetus reminds us so succinctly) things outside of our control cannot possibly be good or bad  how can it? it s just luck of the draw  it may be preferred or not, but it cannot be good or bad  what can be good or bad is the judgments and choices we make now  and in the next present moment  and in the next one   ad infinitum until we have no more present moments  life   a good life is really that simple 

  so as an exercise this week, when you are reflecting on the past year, remind yourself that everything that happened (including your judgments and choices) have no impact on you today and in your future present moments, other than being a potential lesson learnt    look back, by all means, as we can learn from the past  look externally, by all means, for we can only make the best possible judgments and choices with all the information available to us, which includes all externals (like our emotions and what s happening around the world)  but always recall that these are data points to learn from in helping you make good decisions now  they are not good or bad in their own right  just data sets 

i wish you all happy holidays and the strength to view things the way you know them to be, not the way you feel them to be

you know that and huge project assignment s completion deadline is one month from now  you have 2 choice, complete now and perfect it throughout the month or wait until the day before and pull an all nighter only to barely finish  

the only reason you procrastinate is because you know you can complete it in a night  don t give yourself that option, it s only hurting you and the quality of your product  

and we know that there are times when the deadlines aren t fair  an assignment that would take at least a month to complete to perfection is due in 2 weeks  you have to give a big presentation and you only have tonight to prepare  

doesn t that kindle on the lines of momento mori? 

except this time we don t know when we re going to die, we don t have a deadline, we just have to know we are doing the right thing  

death is the ultimate deadline, don t procrastinate  

just because you ve grown a tolerance to poison doesn t mean it s good for you  

as stoics we know that when  picking your poison  the only correct option is no poison at all "

i have battled self hate and depression my entire life  ever since i could remember my mind would constantly remind me that i am not good enough  growing up however i was focused on goals  things like doing well in school and athletics  while i battled my self hate and the idea that literally everyone i meet is better than me i move forward in life  i did well enough in school to be accepted to a decent college and i played sports throughout high school and college  i was social and did well in nearly every aspect of my life  

even through college the idea that everyone has it figured out and is better than me was there but i firmly believe that my goal oriented lifestyle and doing what i enjoyed truly kept it at bay  

fast forward a few years  i am 31 the last few years i have no lived life  i truly hate myself  i got into alcohol and drug use and have done things in the past that i truly cannot forgive myself for  i am in constant fear of this coming to life  they were of a sexual nature when i was drunk and high  i didn't hurt anybody which is the only thing that i can hag my hat on 

i pushed all the woman i have loved in my life away because i convinced myself that i will eventually let me down and hurt them  i was lonely and desperate  i have been sober for over a month for the first time since i can remember and i am trying to tackle the idea of progressing in life  being in the moment, not worrying about what ifs and i simply can't  i have tried everything 

i feel like my life is over  i take stock of my life from a ration position and i truly am the biggest loser i know  worst part is i had every advantage anyone could ask for  i don't have any physical or mental ailments that hinder me in pursuing whatever it is i want to do 

now, there is evidence out there of how disgusting i was acting while doing drugs  the only idea that brings me any solace is death  not 'memento mori' but i am hoping i die soon  i would have committed suicide last year if it weren't the pain it would cause my mother  it is so hard for me to do anything positive as all i think about is my past, and how it defines me as less of a man  i am simply tired

he answered telling me it's useless that i try to study if i can't pay his course since if i'm ""that poor"" i won't  be able to afford education of any kind  i was feeling very uncomfortable and angry because of his assumptions, but i tried to remain polite  i just thanked him for his answer and left the chat shortly after

1,"is it at all contradictory to follow stoic principles and be an anti natalist? i have been applying stoic principles to my life and way of thinking for a few years now, but one school of thought i have always heavily advocated is anti natalism  in my own opinion i believe it is immoral to have children as in the modern world procreation serves little more purpose than to fulfil a desire for pleasure or purpose (if one should feel they are lacking it) and if we are to do that which is good and virtuous   which of course is all entirely subjective based on the individual   then from my perception to have children is to act selfishly 

in that same vein, we live in a world rife with unnecessary suffering  for a large part of my adult life i grew to resent my own existence as it was not my choice to be born to grow up in today's capitalist society in which people are valued more for time and labour than they are as individuals, and have to work the majority of their lives to merely survive  if i am to do what is in my perception is good and virtuous then i could not in good conscience make the choice to bring another life into this world for them to experience the same suffering i have endured  i know that we all need to find meaning and purpose in our suffering, but for the most part suffering is an unnecessary evil and to create life knowing full well that it will one day suffer as well is quite the opposite of virtuous in my opinion   


this is my justification at least for being an ant natalist  does it in any way contradict stoic philosophy?"

and how do you even choose among the many ways of pursuing a virtue if not by measuring subjective pleasure? for example, in pursuing wisdom i might have a preference towards reading history vs  physics  what to choose as a stoic?

  discipline of judgement  

today i journal about the discipline of judgement and to that matter, i use a quote from ma 

 amp  x200b 

anything we have, or feel, that s an impression of anything external  love, desire, fear, and so on 

just before writing this, i wanted a car  i still do, i would say that the desire of wanting a car led me to search on and on in youtube about all the models and types, i would say i have become obsessed in some way to the cars  

but i know that my desire is from a thing external that may never happen, so i make my peace with it  i won t let it control my life 

i have the discipline to know that anything that stresses us, as the quote goes, is not inherent but from the outside and we have the power to stand up  i won t tolerate more bad behaviour to my mind  enough is enough  enough is right now   and then, just stop letting the car control you  

 amp  x200b 

i advise you to read the quote, and again  reflect upon the meaning of it  if you feel bad because you have done something wrong or failed at the work today, or someone insulted you    what can you do about but make peace with it?

don't rethink past or overthink future(like i did in the car example) but rather have the courage to be in the present, revoking all the impressions that may cause you trouble 

i wanting a car and the fact that i am thinking of it all the time are not going to buy me a car  so i have 2 options  continue in my procrastination or work for it  if the work is impossible to do, say, you are still 17 and can't do anything about it, then stop  it's not in your control and if are to have one, or the perfect one, or your favourite one, you'll get it, when the time comes right "

1,"character is key  plato, aristotle, and a host of other philosophers, all destined to take different paths, derived more from socrates  character than from his words    letters from a stoic, letter vi

seneca implies to lucilius that no matter your words, no matter what you write, the real thing people learn from is your character  

all of what was written from socrates  teachings is still extremely insightful, but we re it not for his curiosity that was only shown through his character that we know the benefits and costs of questioning  

a philosopher isn t someone who just writes insightful things, it s a person who acts upon his insight  

marcus aurelius practiced his philosophy, we know that whenever he had unphilosophical thoughts he d go straight to his journal to affirm to himself that he, in fact, is a stoic  

seneca had a journal, but most importantly, seneca had a true friend in lucilius  

it s not always a journal, its not always a person

1,"death in harness stoicism is a philosophy that helps us build better lives and be more productive overall, that s why i started aspiring to become a stoic philosopher  

in one of seneca s letters to lucilius he states that a man should die in harness  a man should be so engrossed in his work, his philosophy that when death approaches, he is happy with all that he has achieved 

in the same letter seneca mentions that it may seem that he is at a current inactive state in his life, but in reality he s still working relentlessly  he only slept because his body forced him to, otherwise his whole day is him studying and advising  he found meaning in life by doing that  

not all of us can find a robust meaning like seneca did, but all we can do is try  we don t have to die working our 9 5, our last breath doesn t need to be in the office  seneca didn t earn any money doing what he loved, so we shouldn t expect our meaning to also be materialistic 

in ancient rome, the worst curse a person can wish upon their enemy is the curse of waiting for death  falling sick again and again, but always recovering, waiting for death, only a step away and yet you re crippled  

as stoics we don t want to die, we accept that is a natural feature of life, so because of the acceptance of this, we want to make the most of our short time on earth, after which we will be forgotten

to the right i close my eyes and envision something that creates fear spiders crawling up my bed, etc   open my eyes, see that it s not there and fear is gone 

to the left, i close my eyes and envision something that would make me sad (the ghost of my father at the edge of the bed)   open my eyes and nothing is there

1,"negative visualization tool  premature eulogies this is something i've kinda done my whole life, and just recently realized how powerful of a tool it can be when done right  a lot of posts here ask about death, and how you can accept it's inevitability  both for you and your loved ones  the practice is simple  if you find yourself upset by the prospect of someone's death(including yourself) think about what you would say at that person's funeral  this can trick your brain into thinking that they are already dead, and help you accept their mortality  and move on  you don't have to physically write it down(i don't), and i wouldn't suggest sharing the fact that you're doing this with the person, just think about it  envision yourself wearing your nice clothes, in a church or wherever, looking at that person in a burial container  think about what you would say, both to that person, and to that person's loved ones  with practice, you'll find it more and more easier to think about and process death as an external 

this practice has the added benefit of you appreciating that person more, because as a stoic you truly understand how inevitable death is, and that it can come for any of us at any time  

an important caveat to note  don't overdo it, as far as your emotional capacity goes  if you find it too upsetting, stop  negative visualization, as well as stoicism as a whole, is a muscle, and takes time and practice to develop

1,"how do i approach the thought of suicide with calm hello 

i have posted here before and it's been colorful 

something a little different from me 

i am pretty sure i am going to die by my own hand  don't worry, i won't ask for methods or something like that  i am actually planning to do it legally, just have to move to the right country, it would take a year or two, but hey, at least i don't have to hide my intentions  

what i want is not to be emotional about the past, i find myself ruminating what could have happened if this was different, that, if i made that choice  i cry and get mad for doing that to kid me, i still see that little me crying, what did he do to be get what he got  (it's a long story)

i don't want to dwell on what could have been, what's done, is done  i either have to live with it or die (i chose this option) 

stoics accept suicide as an option, that is why i am not against it, but i have my issues with it, being living according to nature and virtues  objectively, that can't be pinpointed, if at all 

but acceptance is what i agree with, but my stubborn nature always wonders why? i lived by the notion live and let live, i still got picked on, others trying to direct my life and generally shit like my health issues, finances etc 

well, the time has come to accept things my way, nobody can direct me if i am dead, i don't have the biological burdens, society's burdens and the of my own desires  

can't make the right or wrong choice, the true sens of freedom for me 

why does society even care if an adult wants to die, they go through lengths to stop you with psychiatry coercion    do i bring in so much taxes? haha

1,"suffering is truly a choice a few days ago, i took lsd with some of my friends and ended up contemplating philosophy for a lot of it, experiencing ego death, and what i would consider a state of enlightenment and came to some conclusions, here is what i learned 

no two people have the same perspective, due to the nature of language, it is impossible to be sure that someone has the same experience or perspective as you no matter how much they say they do  most people would agree that grass is green, yet what to me is  green  could appear to someone else as what i interpret as  blue   though it is  green  to both of us, i can never truly know what they see, unless i were to become them  

from this i realized that so much of my life is based on the opinions of others, and so is that of many others  in one moment, i may find myself suffering because of a perceived loss  why am i suffering? perhaps i lost my phone, or my car was wrecked, or something was stolen from me    are these things inherently worthy of suffering over? a stoic would tell you those things are indifferent, and they are  i suffer because i tell myself the things that happened are bad, but why do i do this? 

i realized that in this scenario, i think these things are bad simply because it s generally agreed upon, other people think it s bad, so i should too right? no  what s to stop me from labeling this things as good, instead? why should i allow anyone to tell me when i ought to suffer? 

all suffering is a product of perspective 

there are people who have less than you do, who live more difficult lives than you do, who have been born into circumstances that would cause you to suffer if you were to be placed into them now, but they are happier than you are  why?

so much of the modern human experience is constructed, artificial, and completely subjective  even the reality we experience does not truly exist in the way you think it does  there is no objective reality, because every living being perceives it differently 

infinity  all things that ever have, will, or might exist  the mantra occurred to me   be at peace, for all things are, none of them good nor bad   

recently, my entire life was turned on its head  i was given a weeks notice to leave my place of residence, removed from an organization i had to devoted the last three months of my life to trying to become a part of, having to say goodbye to everyone i know and love, and move to a different state to live with a family member with whom my relationship is troubled  i find my depression creeping towards me once more 

yet, i do not suffer  i do not want  i need only what my body requires  i do not fear  

how? why? because i simply choose not to  when i find myself experiencing negative emotions, i acknowledge them, but do not label them as good or as bad, and eventually they pass  nothing can happen my mind, nothing can harm my soul, unless i choose to be harmed  my body may be harmed by circumstances outside of my control, and if that happens i will do what i can to mend my wounds  what else can i do? suffering does not cause my condition to improve, so why should i?

it can feel like the issues have been discussed and yet to do harm by exiting the conversation  it can be even worse to have actually addressed the problems as well as we can, but we keep talking, finding new things to fight about, letting our hot states lead the way

1,"how do stoics view childhood abuse? i first learned about stoicism many years ago  i've tried applying the philosophy to my own life on and off throughout the years  however, there are some principles that i just don't know if are compatible with my own life  mainly ones about how ""if an assault hasn't harmed your character, then it hasn't harmed you at all"" or  how people who commit evil acts harm themselves more than the victim 

i won't go into details, but i was subject to pretty severe abuse as a child, which resulted in trauma that i've been dealing with my entire adult life  i'm not sure if the statement about ""a harmed character"" applies here, because the events in my childhood definitely caused me to become a bitter, angry person  i grew up without being taught any basic social skills and only learned how to verbally abuse others and be violent  as a result, i spent most of my youth being an asshole to everyone and treating people in ways that i'm now deeply ashamed of

much of this stems from a break up right before lockdown  i am able to get through the days effectively, it doesn t stop me from doing anything  but i m constantly experiencing some moderate background sadness, and every once in a while i m brought to tears  in those moments i try to let the emotion pass through me and reframe things, but it just doesn t feel like i ve developed inner strength  i ve developed the ability to cope with things without it changing my behavior which is nice, but i m still feeling significant emotional pain  

so what s the realistic goal here? does stoicism allow you to feel the pain and cope independently or does it actually reduce the pain? my issues all seem to stem from relationships, break ups, dating in general  i recently had a consultation with a therapist who specializes in relationships, loneliness, and quarter life crisis stuff(i m 28)  but i know all the wisdom needed to reduce unnecessary suffering is in stoicism  i logically understand where my emotional pain stems from and how the source is fallacious, but i still feel inner weakness

1,"music and stoicism a principle of stoicism, as far as i recall, is to be in control of ones emotions, to have power over how we react to certain situations without external stimuli  for example, when dealing with a traumatic issue, a member of the mob would act through drinking and indulging in fallacious behaviors, where on the other hand the philosopher would confide in himself as marcus aurelius would, or confide within a true friend as seneca would  
in islam, it is widely accepted that music is not permissible as it has an affect on a persons mood and it affects their reaction towards a notion, which i have found to be true  picture a poet reciting his poem, with music in the background, where the notes change and where the notes become intense affect the emphasis a listener would receive of a passage (go try it yourself)  
i have seen people publicly state that when they are in a bad mood or emotionally drained, they put on  sad  music and because of said music they start sobbing, such is a great of example of how music negatively affects ones control over their emotions, which in my eyes seems unphilosophical  

on the other hand, the examples i pull from, are examples from the mob, but as us aspiring philosophers, as readers, as people living in accordance to nature  though we live a similar life, our thoughts are far from alike

1,"what was the main catalyst which triggered your spiritual awakening journey? mine was the passing of my wife after 12 years together and a long, eye opening battle with cancer and therefore mortality  i never saw her death as an actual possibility (she was the so young, beautiful and thriving with passion and life) yet i was riddled with an intensity of fear, anxiety, and stress i cannot express in words  after her passing i quit everything and began traveling the world  volunteering, experiencing new cultures, healing, soul searching, learning, meditating, and just living life  she passed in 2014 and since then has helped guide me to a place of healing and truth    one of mindful compassion and self love  it's just so crazy looking back upon it all    like i'm trying to recall a bedtime tale i was told as a child instead of a life i experienced and lived  very surreal, very beautiful too

this subreddits was my haven for more than two years so far  every time i m going through hard times i d just scroll through this sub and read digestible small bites of reminders of how a good stoic should think and act  and then i d slowly fix myself and recalibrate then eventually get better 

so i really need you guys to tell me about other subreddits that would give me similar benefits  tell me your experiences with these subreddits and how you reflect on them as well "
1,"can someone explain stoicism to me in a way that is easily implementable? so i came across this concept a few times now and tried googling it but i'm actually having a rather difficult time wrapping my head around it  like, what is it about and how come people keep recommending this whenever you got problems with keeping a positive attitude and stuff?"
1,"issues with anger, and the harmful actions of others background first, shortened because it's not all vital info nor worth fuming over as i write  
 
my father in law is an ass  he's verbally assulted my sister in law in a restaurant some time ago, and my wife more recently  those are two incidents i know details about, but there are more  he hasn't gotten physical, but i fear that's only a matter of time (if i'm present for another such outburst, police will be called)  
 
as for amends, he's said nothing to his daughters about the incidents  he begrudgingly attended a few therapy sessions, as we made them a requirement if he wanted to be at our wedding  
 
both in laws are visiting for new years (yup during covid, and yup they're putting their grand kids at risk, they don't seem to mind)  they know he's not welcome at our home, and so they're staying locally with a friend of the family  
 
there'll be dining out, group stuff like brewery visits or something, the ball drop, and similar things that i'll be expected to attend  covid concerns aside, i'm not sure i can be near this guy  i don't recall ever before being this angry at someone  
 
the topic throws my stoic efforts to the wind, and it kind of feels like i'm loosing myself in the anger    and he's not even in town yet  
 
so my question is  how do stoics deal with this? both the external issues of such a volitile person, and the inner issues of such anger   
 
i realize i can't control him, only myself, but what direction to i control myself toward? forgiveness seems out of the question, as pretending it didn't happen is a sure fire way to let it happen again  conversation about the issues seems pointless, as he's in denial about them    i'm at a loss "

just yesterday, my boss received a notice from our state government saying the property tax of the house she currently owns and lives in has increased because said government has raised the estimated value of the house is worth 1 6 mil

first time post here so i hope this fits 

i've had a really tough time at work recently (haven't we all!) but i am dealing with it as best i can  some basic stoic practice has been incredibly helpful to me to process things  aside from morning and evening meditations i've been reading some marcus aurelius and every so often i come across passages that blow me away and really stick in my mind   one in particular is in book 4, iii 

""they seek for themselves private retiring places, as country villages, the sea shore, mountains  yea, thou thyself art wont to long much after such places  but all this thou must know proceeds from simplicity in the highest degree  at what time soever thou wilt, it is in thy power to retire into thyself, and to be at rest, and free from all businesses ""

1,"most of the world is irrational? i was just thinking about this while driving on the highway the other day  i live in florida, so the speed limit is 70 mph, but then everybody, and i mean absolutely everybody, drives at 80 mph at least  i've seen people getting pulled over so many times too, so they do enforce the law here   it's just that people keep breaking the law lol   sometimes i even get honked at for ""driving too slow"" as i always drive at 70 mph (like a good citizen) 

what got me thinking is that how much time it actually saves by breaking the law and risking getting a ticket  

assuming if your workplace is 70 miles away (which is unrealistic, but let's go with it for convenience of calculation), then it takes you an hour to get there if you obey the law and drive at 70 mph  if you break the law and drive at 80 mph though, it takes you 0 875 hours to get to work  that's 52 minutes and 30 seconds  so in essence, you would've saved only 7 minutes and 30 seconds if you break the law  but if your workplace is 35 miles away (which is appropriate for most people), you save even less time  in fact, you save only 3 minutes and 45 seconds  rationally, it's never worth it, but most people just do it anyway   every single day   it just makes me wonder "

 gt men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the country, seashores,  and mountains  and thou too art wont to desire such things very much   but this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men, for it is  in thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself  for  nowhere either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble does a man  retire than into his own soul, particularly when he has within him such  thoughts that by looking into them he is immediately in perfect  tranquillity  and i affirm that tranquillity is nothing else than the  good ordering of the mind  constantly then give to thyself this retreat,  and renew thyself  and let thy principles be brief and fundamental,  which, as soon as thou shalt recur to them, will be sufficient to  cleanse the soul completely, and to send thee back free from all  discontent with the things to which thou returnest  for with what art  thou discontented? with the badness of men? recall to thy mind this  conclusion, that rational animals exist for one another, and that to  endure is a part of justice, and that men do wrong involuntarily  and  consider how many already, after mutual enmity, suspicion, hatred, and  fighting, have been stretched dead, reduced to ashes  and be quiet at  last  but perhaps thou art dissatisfied with that which is assigned to  thee out of the universe  recall to thy recollection this alternative   either there is providence or atoms   fortuitous concurrence of things     or remember the arguments by which it has been proved that the world is a  kind of political community   and be quiet at last    but perhaps  corporeal things will still fasten upon thee  consider then further that  the mind mingles not with the breath, whether moving gently or  violently, when it has once drawn itself apart and discovered its own  power, and think also of all that thou hast heard and assented to about  pain and pleasure   and be quiet at last    but perhaps the desire of the  thing called fame will torment thee  see how soon everything is  forgotten, and look at the chaos of infinite time on each side of   the  present  , and the emptiness of applause, and the changeableness and want  of judgment in those who pretend to give praise, and the narrowness of  the space within which it is circumscribed   and be quiet at last    for  the whole earth is a point, and how small a nook in it is this thy  dwelling, and how few are there in it, and what kind of people are they  who will praise thee "

how do i deal with the mental pain that i constantly receive from thinking about all the societal problems (about which i won't go into detail unless necessary) over which i have little to no control?

it mostly annoys me because of how powerless i feel over it and that it may negatively impact people i care about, even complete strangers i don't know 

i know spending time and energy on pondering issues i have no control over is one of the things stoicism is against, but being completely passive about it sounds like a horrible alternative to me"

1,"dichotomy of control as a defense mechanism (state of the sub)   let me preface before i continue    i understand that there are different facets, a multitude of nuances that can be debated over and considered in vs  out of our direct control, and many of these situations are conditional, sometimes subjective, however this is not the discussion i want to make today 

after seeing multiple posts and discussions about the direction r stoicism is heading and the subsequent   it s out of your control, bro  but you re getting worked up about it, so that s not very stoic of you   comments on those threads, it seems that the dichotomy of control model that many love to drool over is becoming a tool to encourage a passive mindset, and worse  a defense mechanism toward a discussion that they disagree or are not comfortable with 

there is even a flavor of gatekeeping, implying that advocating for any sort of change to improve the quality of the subreddit makes you less of a stoic a person give in to their reactions than those who adhere to the black and white definition of the dichotomy of control 

as is mentioned multiple times by many, stoics are not passive  r stoicism was created as a space to encourage discussion and growth of ideas but if those ideas stray too far from what is generally considered stoic it is our duty to gently steer the conversation back on track  

sure, one  does  have the option to let it be, but you are allowing the other to foster their inaccuracies and in turn help spread it  it is one thing to have educated them about their mistakes and yet they stubbornly hold on to their misconstrued idea despite all you ve done, and another to simply let them go because you can t be bothered 

one is accepting the consequences of your action, the other is passivity 

when others call out something another redditor proposes to improve this sub as  it s out of your control, you can choose to ignore it  that is perpetuating this half baked practice of the dichotomy of control  

when you've exhausted all viable options to help improve a situation, and yet the result is the same,  that  is out of your control and when you accept fate

1    require a flair for all posts     this is super easy   the steps are as simple as mod tools   gt  post requirements   gt  post flair   once that's done, stoics on the subreddit can filter out posts based on flairs 
2    add ""humor"" and ""advice"" flairs     also super easy to do   nobody said jokes aren't allowed on the subreddit, but it's up to the mods to determine a quality joke from a meme or low effort joke   for those of us who are more sticks in the mud than the mods, we could then filter out all ""humor"" from the subreddit!  same goes for the advice posts   if some stoics here feel inundated by the advice posts, this gives them the power to turn the spigot, so to speak

1,"this subreddits low effort content which misrepresents stoicism has turned into the rule, not the exception i have been meaning to make this post for a while but i think its time now after seeing  this ( post  as a long time contributor to this subreddit for the most part i don't browse this subreddit anymore because frankly the quality of this subreddit is extremely poor  the current state of this subreddit content is a parody of stoicism, low effort posts that resembles bad and blatantly misleading representations of stoicism that flies in the face of the quality and complexity of the stoic philosophy displayed in the texts of the big three and the values of hardwork and dedication showed by them  

the post above is a perfect example of what i am talking about, a low effort completely misleading representation of stoicism should not be on the top of this subreddit  the fact is that the lack of quality control in this subreddit does not reflect ancient or modern stoicism but misrepresentations, bad takes are the rule of this subreddit not the exception  stoicism isn't about being unaffected or above it all like it is represented in that post, but correctly applying wisdom, justice, courage and temperance to every aspect of our lives but this is very rarely discussed in this subreddit  

the solution is simple, mods need to enforce their own rules which they constantly neglect by letting offending posts slide, and make rules to remove these low effort image posts or turn this subreddit back into text only  the mod team, i believe in this subreddit the mod team is far far too small to do anything, subreddits with 360k subs have vastly larger mod team  not only is it small but i feel like the mods want to make the subreddit immediately accessible and agreeable to every new comer  this policy might have accelerated growth but it has lost its stoic flavour in the process  i joined this sub when it had 30k subs and it is a dramatically different sub then it is today  i would like to hear the mods and the subreddits in general thoughts on this "

1,"stoic quotes aren't really helping you    i may sound as an ""orthodox reader"" but, as someone who spent over 10 years studying philosophy, i'm very concerned about so many people reducing it all to isolated quotes that are not only taken out of the broader context, but also misinterpreted through the same ideological veil that, ironically, is precisely what philosophy should help you overcome 

this is specially true with stoicism (it got really popular in 2020) and it's frightening to see how most of the online content about it has become extremely shallow and commoditized  it all functions as a mere palliative tool for psychological relief, overshadowing the whole majesty of this discipline

i'm aware that myers briggs personality tests are far from being a good assessment of an individual's personality, but they can give a kind of broad, low resolution idea of an individual's tendencies and thought patterns  i personally always turn out as the same personality type no matter how many times i take it, but i know the lines can be blurred for others due to its unscientific nature  

 link to the poll  (

if you also know where you stand on the big five personality traits, feel free to share your data if you wish to  

i'm an intj  my personal guess before any results come in is that stoicism probably attracts the ""intuitive thinking"" (nt) types more so than others, but we'll see what comes from the results of this poll  

    aaaand i should have googled this subject  before  writing this thread and poll  facepalm  though to be fair, none of the threads that have already been made on this subject seem to have a poll attached to them, so i guess that's a first  might as well submit for fresh new data "

1,"i just had a breakup    and i feel fine! only now do i realize the dramatic impact just beginning to get into stoicism has had on me  instead of giving in and wallowing in perceived loss, i realized that i didn't have control over the circumstances or events outside of myself (the long distance was the problem) or any person except myself  

i realized that i could accept and acknowledge the feelings that were present, but that i should also remember that i only have control over one thing  my reaction to these events  i determined that take what i could learn from it instead of regressing in character, and that i'd forgive and empathize with my former partner  this is the respect we issue to other rational beings and aligns with the virtue of justice 

furthermore, i can appreciate that we had enjoyable times  everything is temporary, thus we can acknowledge when we are allowed to indulge in moderation while also realizing that nothing will remain forever  

as a result, i feel far better than i think i would have if i hadn't gained this perspective  i didn't mean to make a big point and i'm new so you can point out something if you find it flawed, but i just wanted to remind you of the effect even a bit of stoic teaching can have on the uninitiated "
1,"stoic approach to dealing with passing up on your big break? a few months ago i was offered my dream job in my dream field  it likely would have been the perfect stepping stone to further, more advanced work in my desired field too  the only problem was that it required moving away from where i currently live and grew up to a small town in the middle of nowhere  it therefore would have required leaving my friends and family (who i had just reconnected with after 3 pretty miserable years at uni) and living on my own in a strange new place in the middle of a pandemic where opportunities to make new connections and build up a support network are limited 

while recognised how fortunate i was to have been offered a job given the current condition of the world, i ultimately decided that the costs outweighed the benefits and turned down the job, opting to take up a place in the reserve pool where candidates could be offered other upcoming vacancies  at the time i convinced myself i was acting virtuously because i wasn t abandoning my personal relationships and roles (i tutor local students and look after my young brothers) for the sake of career progression and financial gain, but i fear i ve both mislead myself and made a massive mistake 

not only have i failed to find any long term work in my local area, but the offer of a job through the reserve pool has been non existent  furthermore, as i have continued my studies of stoic theory i m beginning to suspect i based my decision on vice, not virtue  these quotes from book 2 of epictetus  discourses were particularly impactful 

 gt   27   every day you should put the ideas in action that protect against attachment to externals such as individual people, places or institutions   even your own body   
 gt   
 gt   29   after all, what difference does it make what a person is enslaved to, and cannot live without? you re no different from a teenager mooning over a girl when you ache for your familiar haunts, your club, your old gang of friends and former way of life

 gt   35   how can you associate yourself with socrates, who lived and died as he did, or with diogenes?   36   you cannot imagine either of them reduced to tears or tantrums because they weren t going to see this man, or that woman, or because they had to be in susa, say, or ecbatana, rather than athens or corinth 

in these quotes i can see that my decision not to move may have been based on attachments to my family and friends, and that, as a result, my decision was based in vice  as a result i ve missed out on a huge opportunity and i have no current prospects    


how would a stoic approach this situation i find myself in? how would they handle the anxiety and regret i feel? i m still quite new to all this and i would appreciate any guidance anyone could give  thanks "

the practice didn't count for anything this week at work  i was short with one co worker  i was blaming my colleagues actions for my frustrations  my heart was racing  i was in a rush to get somewhere  fumbling around trying to plug in a laptop charger felt as stressful as open heart surgery  i reacted to not being able to connect to a printer like someone had just stolen my car  for the first time i snapped at my other co worker  i found despite consciously being aware of my state that i couldn't control my behaviour 

he said ""you seem stressed""  i thought, and replied that i was, and probably need time to cool off  by the afternoon, i was calm and apologised for my actions  i don't remember experiencing anything like this in my adult life

  i'd had less sleep than normal 

  i'd taken a caffiene pill and had a coffee  

  i went into the office, for perhaps the 5th time in 10 months   in fact between that and the supermarket that's been it so despite speaking to others on games and over the phone i'd probably become unsocialised 

  on the way to work, i was having intrusive thoughts and emotions linked to some transgressions years prior 

now i'm wondering whether i'm not practicing stoicism well enough, or at least wondering what i could do differently  i was aware of my state  i wanted to behave better at the time  and yet it didn't change my state, and i was barely in control of my own thoughts nor my own behaviour "

1,the apps that will help your stoicism journey  removed 
1,"advice regarding involuntary expressiveness what's up, stoic circle?  got a topic for discussion   i've really gotten the hang of not allowing dispreferred events to bother me long term   it's helped stop me from developing holding grudges, reduced my overall anxiety about uncertainty, etc   however, it seems that i still have an immediate outward response to something, even if i rationally expected it to occur   you might call it an outburst   for instance, let's say i'm playing a sport and miss a point   i will outwardly react in a frustrated manner, but almost immediately after that initial reaction, i'm good to go   no lasting regret or disappointment or distress   but i want to make it so those involuntary reactions are less frequent or expressive 

i get that we as stoics are not supposed to be unemotive or literally stone faced   that emotions and expressing them is healthy   but i also recognize that allowing proto emotions to trigger an outward reaction before i have a chance to rationally observe them is problematic and can lead to false impressions about me 

i've started to just do a little cbt if that's the right word   if i have an outburst, i just mentally catch myself, make a note of it, and tell myself that ""expression is fine, reaction is not,"" but i'm still working on it   anyone have any techniques for lengthening the gap between proto emotions and outward response?"

1,"using an ungifted gift as a reminder of impermanence about 5 months ago, i was in a great spot  i was working out, had a relationship ""lined up"" (and yes, i am at fault for thinking it was 100  going to work out)  this was a girl that made me happy no matter what else was happening in my life  she was great to me and i felt comforted just seeing her  

i decided to get her a gift for our first official date  a nice blue and silver necklace  it's cheap and from amazon but she didn't have to know that  however, our relationship took for a turn after we both made some mistakes  a lot of fights, me being emotionally hurt (due to my expectations and desires)  a lot of self development, but you're not here for that 

i tried getting rid of the necklace a few times by asking friends if they wanted it but they rejected for one reason or another  now it sits on my desk by my copy of the discourses of epictetus as a reminder to not have false expectations  i wonder if anyone else has something similar and wants to share their story "
1,"seeking advice on framing, dealing with anxious thoughts as i deal with consequences of mistakes made that i cannot take back i am seeking some advice on how to be stoic in my current situation, as i feel as though i am spiraling  my family has recently dealt with our fair share of stressful events, noting that we're very new to the practice of stoicism and i am especially not very good at parsing what i can control, what i cannot  i suffer from anxiety disorder, and have only recently begun to address it through therapy  we lost our pet cat suddenly to heart disease 2 weeks ago  we are in the process of buying a home, and the bank has given us the run around on this, despite having good incomes and great debt to income ratios  we have had to compensate for the ineptitude of those we work with, and the inefficiency of the capitalist system  but i've had a good perspective throughout the whole process, understanding that there's a pandemic raging, and that the process of home buying can become stressful and expensive, not entirely because of what we did  i'm in the process of switching jobs after the home closes  for my new job, i had to apply for a corporate credit card  without thinking about it i applied, only to realize that there is the potential of a hard inquiry on my credit report which may affect my ability to close  of course, i reached out to them to stop processing it a little too late, and the credit card company already received the request  but since then i've been able to get a hold of some support staff who advised as to some possible next steps to ensure the cc application does get canceled  we close by the end of the year, and at this point i don't know what will happen  william b irvine's lesson on framing really is helping me some, because i am worrying about the outcome of something hurting me that has not yet happened  as it stands, the cc application has not yet gone through, the bank has not yet asked questions, and nothing has happened  but i have not been able to deal with this very well  i am looking for advice "

1,"negative motivation vs positive motivation? i used to be motivated by negative things   desires for fame and fortune, desires for revenge, to prove people right, these types of things  through stoicism over time, i've let these things go, and am happier for it  the problem is is that i'm almost completely unmotivated, and can't find any justification to be motivated  i am pretty happy with life overall  i really wish i had that burning drive and motivation to accomplish big things, but i can't find any positive ways to justify it and fuel it     
    
is there any fix to this? is there a way to justify a kind of nietzschean will to power, to have the drive of julius ceasar or sulla or elon musk or john carmack alongside stoicism? to want to try and conquer the world or accomplish as much as possible to prove to yourself you can do it, while also being content and level headed about life?"

1,"i was in a car crash today on the way home from work today i was in a 4 car crash  airbags went off, car is totalled and i was extremely lucky to walk away with barely a scratch on me 

i'm only 30, recently married, no kids yet and have always held a view of death with a kind of indifference  the only loss i have experienced in these 30 years is that of pets and an estranged grandmother who died when i was in my mid 20's who i had no contact with since i was around 6  i think this had lead to my indifference (might not be the best word) towards death  obviously i have been very upset when my pets have died but it's something that you deal with and move on 

anyway, after the crash today i was fine, got out of the car and checked on all the other drivers involved and during the whole experience i barely felt my heart rate increase to the point in which i noticed that was the case  i was calm 

i have had a bit of emergency training in the past which i believe helped but it is still weird to look back at how calm i was at the time 

it's been a little over 5 hours since the crash now and i think for the first proper time in my life, i am afraid of death  i am afraid of the things i could miss  i am afraid of not having kids  i am afraid of not being able to support my parents  i am afraid of not growing old with my wife  

you see stories of people everyday who die in an instant from some kind of freak accident and part of your brain always disassociates that from yourself  today i was reminded that anyone could die at any moment and to make sure you make the most of your time because you will never know if you have 1 day left or 10000 

carpe diem
memento mori"
1,"long term solutions  lately, i'm thinking a lot about long term solutions  i don't think they exist  even stoicism isn't or shouldn't be considered that way  whenever you start doing something because you think it affects your life in the long term, you're making assumptions about a future that is not in your control  

let's look at an example  say you want to implement some kind of practice in your life, learning an instrument, workout, whatever  you have a goal in mind, an outcome that you get when you do it long enough  but after a while, you stop  you think you don't get the merit out of it as you should  

you stopped because you thought about it as a long term investment  as soon as you get impatient, you only see the negative parts, the effort it takes just to keep going  it starts to be a battle of willpower  maybe you are strong enough to achieve what you planned, but more often you will stop because it doesn't seem worth the effort anymore 

but what happens, if we change the only thing, we all truly are able to  our mindset  if we think about something only in short terms, we get a completely different view  we start because it seems to affects us positively  if it doesn't, we stop, but if it does we do it again tomorrow  and the day after  it doesn't become tedious, because each day we see the positive outcome  and almost effortless we achieve things others would think be impossible without the daily struggle 

and i think it works universally  a while ago, i read a post about that people often search for short term solutions on this subreddit and that stoicism works only when you embrace it and make it a lifestyle  i dwelled on it for quite a while  who decides how long it takes to make something a lifestyle  to me, it sounds again like an assumption about the future  ""if i commit long enough to stoicism, i will   ""  to some point it's true, you won't get anything out of it if you do it once  but that's the case for everything  a single therapy session won't solve your problems either  but only if you see some kind of results, you will keep going 

i don't write my thoughts down in my journal, so i may feel better in a week  i write them down to reflect on right now  i meditate, not to get better over the next year, but because it calms me now and lets me observe my mental state 

i don't think there are long term solutions  only short term solutions, that proved to be successful  only in retrospection, one can see the long term effect  that's why it's good to keep track of once progress, so the improvement gets visible 

so, if you lay on your deathbed, reflecting on your life, and say stoicism was your long term solution, i might not disagree 

sorry, that was quite a long shower

1,"what are your thoughts and opinions on this? hello, was curious about this community s opinion   

i think at least we can change things by changing ourselves, that is, by finding our own self, or, by accepting some aspects and correcting some of them  in fact, we can inspire the lives of others, even when we think we are creating awareness in our own lives  but first we need to focus on our selves 

i also think that information that is hardly used at all won't do me much good  but, the information i can use in my life is useful  i am not a person living with the past, but, i can say that i have a concern for the future  i will do my best to overcome these concerns, because it makes it difficult for me to focus on other jobs  when i experience bad events, the events that i have mentioned as a reason for them, such as the death of a loved one, i tell myself that it is bad because i think badly, and that scene i call bad reflects as a positive thought and a good memory  our reaction to these events related to how we see and name things 

but, sometimes, thinking pessimistically becomes my feeding point  experiencing an event that saddens me makes me write better  maybe, it's because i think sadness makes me write better  but, sometimes  i just keep an eye on a flying bee, and travel the world with it "

1,"scholarship for a university i applied for first year students   essay prompt     describe an intellectual idea that has transformed your thinking    (i decided to write about stoicism as my essay answer, please give me constructive criticism  

the ability to maintain equanimity in an ever changing world is a powerful skill  it effectively recalibrates and strengthens one s mind  this is the primary foundation of stoicism, a timeless roman philosophy, which transformed my thinking  stoicism was founded by zeno of citium in 300 b c e and has encountered an immense following from the 3rd century to the present day  due to other famous philosophers such as seneca, epictetus, and marcus aurelius leaving detailed journals on stoicism combined with practices that many individuals embodied  the philosophy continues to grow  stoic exercises include an abundance of mindset shifts and daily phrases which have fostered my growth 

i first encountered stoicism during the initial quarantine (april 2020)  it was an extremely stressful time in which my reality was completely altered  consequently, i became heavily unmotivated and lackadaisical due to forces outside of my control  initially, remote learning presented itself as a hindrance to my scholastic progress  i completed school assignments but found myself clueless about the direction my learning should take because i was accustomed to classroom instruction  however, this changed once i read  meditations  by marcus aurelius 

in his journal, i discovered emperor aurelius  daily thinking which attributed to his mental toughness  he goes into full detail about his accomplishments and failures at the end of each day  by becoming dismissive towards things outside of his control, he expounds that failure is not negative but a new opportunity for success  immediately, i was given a new perspective on my lack of motivation towards remote learning  i then used this new learning experience as an opportunity to improve as a student 

merriam webster defines the stoic phrase memento mori as a reminder of mortality  every day i strive to embody this stoic principle  aurelius professes that one could die at any second and this fact should govern an individual s mannerisms  i was intrigued by such a concept and my viewpoint on time began to shift  i realized it imperative to make constructive use of each second because the next one may not be guaranteed  having integrated memento mori into all phases of my learning my studying habits and time management skill have greatly improved  in retrospect, remote learning created more time to fully devote myself to studies and career aspirations 

through stoicism, i also discovered amor fati  the english translation of this latin phrase is an embracement of one s fate  whenever i encounter situations outside of my control, i remain neutral and decide to love my destiny  in doing so, i do not become a conduit for negativity and make myself available for positivity  subsequently, in learning to love myself i have become more accepting of others  now understanding that each day all of humanity is being presented with situations outside of our control, my compassion has grown  stoicism has birthed within a new desire to learn more intellectual ideas  being my first stop in the realm of philosophy, i am elated to encounter what lies ahead "

allow me to clarify  i don t think being virtuous is a waste of time  i would misrepresent myself if i said it is  but, trying to be virtuous in this age is difficult  because, i tried very hard to be humble and approach people in a forgiving attitude, this experiment failed  in my opinion, stoic philosophy is interesting and useful  to clarify further  i am not against stoic philosophy, i just wanted to say the difficulty of trying to be virtuous, at least in this century 

i m sure what marcus went through was very difficult at that time  but first, i have to meet my own needs  in other words, there is unemployment and economic crisis, especially in our country  it is difficult to think about this because of financial difficulties  and i don't want to put myself in a mold right now  but, i value people's opinions, so i read the philosophies of thinkers  fortunately, there are philosophers, and fortunately, there are free brains to think differently 

and of course, anything is possible if you want and work for it  perhaps the excuse that i mentioned is the moment  but, as i m telling you, it's hard for me to focus on this situation right now  so, i will try to read and understand them  maybe i will decide on this path in the future and walk "

1,"stoicism for a better life   weekly exercise (december 13, 2020) hello there,

with the holiday seasons around the corner, i will keep the topic pertinent to the season  and since i recently re read some of seneca s work as a refresher and reminder, i ll stick with his words of wisdom to inspire us this week  here s a gem from his letters to lucilius, xviii 

 gt   a man gives himself the surest proof of his steadfastness if he neither goes nor allows himself to be led to the agreeable pastimes which involve self indulgence  it shows more austerity to stay dry and sober when the crowd is puking drunk, but more control not to make oneself an exception, not to be markedly different nor yet one of the crowd, but to do as others do, only not in the same way  it is possible to observe a holiday without self indulgence  

half of this quote is something i often speak up against, which is the false claim that stoicism is about austerity  self deprivation in and of itself is not virtuous  of all the ancient stoic teachers, seneca is the most vocal on this topic as well  he is the one that reminds us it is okay to be entertained  it is okay to have some wine  it is okay to indulge in the little things that help us unwind, rest and relax, for our minds and bodies are tools and just like any tool, overuse and discipline can harm it, damage it and be counterproductive 

but it is the other half of this quote that is interesting  he is reminding us that unlike our cynic older cousins, as stoics we do not remove ourselves from custom  we recognize the fictitious nature of this society we live in, however, we chose to participate in this fake construct so as to be able to help our fellow cosmopolitans  we cannot be on the outside looking in and try and influence people  we must be part of society to be able to have the greatest impact towards the betterment of humanity (the human community)  we re agents working from the inside trying to be agents for positive change as it were 

and this is what seneca is reminding us as it pertains to holiday gatherings  okay, so this won t be pertinent for most of us as we are on varying degrees of lockdown  personally, in montreal, we are on full lockdown so we can t be with anyone  however, the lesson is still sound and something we can all reflect on even in isolation  don t try and be too austere  don t overindulge  don t unduly deprive yourself  don t be reliant on externals  the name of the game is equanimity balance focusing on the only things that matters  our judgments and intentions 

  so as an exercise this week, reflect on your plans for the holidays, no matter what they may be  are planning too much on netflix? drinks? shopping? social media? self pity in self isolation? are you planning on ignoring the holidays altogether?   consider what it is you plan on and ask yourself    what value is this going to bring to me or humanity?   never forget that the starting point is always will this help me work towards the betterment of humanity? will this help make the world a better place  this is the starting point, even for the holidays 

i ho ho hope you have a great week (yup i m sorry for that i am a dad and cannot pass up a good opportunity for a dad joke)  we can all take the opportunity this holiday season to become a little bit more virtuous, without ignoring the customs of our society 

your friends

as we live virtuously, we aren't weighed down by guilt or the inevitable consequences of cutting corners  this allows us to have tranquility  we add more tranquility by letting go of things outside the scope of our control  having this tranquility makes it easier to live virtuously, as we all make better decisions with less stress and frustration

when i start my day, if i have the time i will meditate but nevertheless i'll embrace the mortality of my love ones and myself 

by doing this, i know that there is a possibility that i can die or my love ones can die  by embracing it, i size the  day

1,"a practical saying to say to yourself hello all, i saw earlier a post about a good practical saying to tell yourself when trouble comes about  arrian has also given us a good saying to work with whenever you encounter trouble in life  

""make a start, then, with small things  a drop of oil is spilled, a little wine is stolen  say to yourself,  such is the price at which equanimity is bought  such is the price that one pays for peace of mind   for nothing can be acquired at no cost at all ""

to expand on this, here he is telling us that tranquility, equanimity and peace of mind are not free  we all want equanimity but not all want to pay for it by practicing in troubled moments  so whenever you encounter adversity, remember that it is neccessary and by facing it you will get closer to equanimity "

1,"i'm greek, raised and living in greece  never once has stoicism been mentioned in school   i'm greek, born here, raised most of my life here, still live here (it's not as you think it's poverty and ghetto don't get excited)  for a long enough time now ""it is what it is, life moves forward"" has been my main quote dealing with everything from inconveniences to even tragedy, yes we mourn but we cannot stop progressing in life sadly 

anyway today i happened to stumble upon a video about ""stoicism"" with the title ""stoicism  the art of not caring"" i almost brushed it off as i already practice this most of the time but the setting and all seemed interesting so i said since i got nothing else to watch i'm gonna shoot it a shot might as well 

surprised to find out it's basically my mentality and my way of thinking, not only this  but it originates from my country's ancestors  now i'm really not a patriot, nor do i care about history, i believe in progress and history is the past, no need to know what cavemen and the romes did while our struggle has just begun, almost failed history  

but, i am 100  certain this has not   once   been mentioned in a history book here, i think the why is obvious, they do not want people to be oblivious, they want us to be stressed so we work as we're told  

we all know we're taught what they want to teach us, censor or even overwrite history, but i felt like this had to be mentioned here 

 proves they want us to care, they want us to be stressed, they want us to be controlled  "
1,"advice needed  i will keep this relatively short  my wife, who has suffered for many years of chronic pain and major depression has attempted suicide more times in the past several  months than i can count on one hand  although i have stopped her attempts, the stress of this living situation has taken a tremendous toll on my mental health, as i, instead of allowing her, have ardently tried to stop her 

i know the stoic view on suicide, a sort of indifference, i can paraphrase scenica as stating ""a man lives as long as he should, not as long as he can,"" and in her situation i imagine i would seek the same, yet knowing versus practicing remains to me two incredibly different things 

i'm not sure what i hope to get out of this thread, but your input is valued kind strangers

1,"health and wealth   in our control or indifferent? i'm currently reading ""the little book of stoicism"" written by jonas salzberger  he states that there are things that are in our control and things that aren't  when he first mentioned that health and wealth are not under our control, i thought to myself ""right, some people have a non curable diseases since their birth and some aren't able to work in fields that pay well""  

but during  20 pages he mentions this statement 4 5 times without talking about that for health you are responsible in a way that you shouldn't smoke, exercise some time, eat healthy etc  and for wealth one can invest, learn a new skill and so on 

so what bothers me, is that (at least in the book i'm reading) there is the narrative of health and wealth being out of our control  i get that there are things especially about our health that we can't change, but the majority of aspects are in our hands, at least in my opinion 

what is your opinion on that matter?"

basically i've been through a rough period in september and i've had a lot of trouble not ruminating on the same thoughts constantly  so i thought to myself, i've pretty much allowed myself to think about the matter enough and i will not profit by thinking any more about it  yet intrusive, ""empty"" thoughts kept coming back and i had a lot of trouble not giving them any more attention than they deserve once they had appeared  i've placed a rubber band on my wrist and now every time a thought about that particular period about the situation in which i had no control over someone elses actios comes up, i pull back the rubber band and let loose  this stops the unwanted thought process quite quickly  i don't think this is good on the long term but it can definitely help on short the short term for thoughts too intrusive due to making a habit out of thinking about them "
1,"acne and stoicism recently i ve been pretty concerned about my current situation with how my face looks and, in the end, i think i had the answer right in front of me  stoicism practice  

maybe not as the absolute answer but the way to see this situation  i ve been dealing with acne for years now, sometimes more sometimes less  i even had my face clear at some moments in my life  and i know that for some people that had it worse my face is really nice, so apart from stoicism i had to accept that i m not the only one on this journey 

learning about stoicism during the last two years had me resolving this problem with two perspectives that i ve been practising recently 

  one is amor fati  in this case i opted to ignore the way my face looks at every moment  it will be what future decides, not me  i even think sometimes my acne comes down to overthink the cause of the problem 

  the other is to focus on what i can control  i m doing things right (good health, sports, nutrition and calm) and there are times where i would get acne for no reason  so i know i m doing what i  supposed to do, and that s what matters

1,"a trick which has been helping me hi all  a lot of the time we understand the theory of stoicism but in practice find it difficult  one trick that is really working for me at the moment on the practical side of things, although it sounds very simple is this

to be clear, i do often feel the same emotion of the person i am in conversation with, but i rarely feel genuine in displaying the frustration, anger or sadness that they do or i suppose is usual in these situations 

i have not been challenged or questioned about appearing unemotional  it is just something i feel and it bothers me a bit  i would like to know how to explain and talk about why this is which is not ""i practice stoicism""  i want to be able to explain it in a more relatable and non preachy way "

1,"a nice moment of clarity today  

  gt       to the rational animal only is the irrational intolerable  but that which is rational is tolerable      blows are not naturally intolerable  how is that? see how the lacedaemonians   spartans in military training   endure whipping when they have learned that whipping is consistent with reason  to hang yourself is not intolerable  when then you have the opinion that it is rational, you go and hang yourself  in short, if we observe, we shall find that the animal man is pained by nothing so much as by that which is irrational  and, on the contrary, attracted to nothing so much as to that which is rational   (

i've found this to be a powerful observation  when something disturbs me, if i can see some sensible reason for it, it will likely disturb me much less 

the funny thing about this is that everything, if we look closely enough, is reasonable  why did that tree fall on my car? if was big and heavy and unbalanced, and it was rotting at the base and had a crack in it  you parked under it the very day that crack finally let go, because you couldn't see how precarious it was  there's always a sensible reason for everything   and i don't mean this is a religious way or a fateful way, i mean that there is just a simple chain of cause and effect behind everything, and each link in that chain is always just as reasonable as can be  

if we could see all of it, nothing would ever appear unreasonable to us  just the very fact that a thing has occurred is proof that it is a result of some sensible process 

so i was at home depot today, picking up some materials to finish a difficult project, and i encountered the usual sorts of annoyances there that might set anyone off  i did what most of us do, catching myself and checking myself, and taking the time to explain to myself that these things were normal and natural and nothing to make a fuss over 

and after a few seconds of this, for what felt like the first time ever, it just sort of clicked   _it was unnecessary to explain  _ of course this is reasonable, what else could it be? my usual practice was just chatter  everything is fine 

this feeling lasted maybe half an hour  various other minor challenges   an unstaffed drive in window at arbys, the discovery that a necessary part clearly won't fit without extensive modification   were just things to be handled, not argued with  perfectly sensible things, unobjectionable things, that plainly felt sensible and unobjectionable  it was nice

this brought an exceptional degree of stress to me, and for almost an entire day i was possessed with stress, anxiety, accusation and financial concern  my mind spiraled into a bad state, one which i felt powerless to escape from   as if caugh up in some chain reaction of anxiety or fighting against an ocean swell  that is until i heard a silent voice in my mind telling me to ""remember""    to remember my new found comitment to my stoic practice 

  lt b gt  the action   lt  b gt 

i took a moment to meditate on the situation, which lead to the realisation of ""things as they"" i reminded myself that the loss was materialistic    metal and plastic, a financial expense that came from a work bonus, a regreful loss but in the grand scheme of things   an inconsequential loss at that and a luxury that i can one day recover 

 i felt my mind settle,  as if a storm had subsided over a turbulent ocean  i segregated tasks into those under my control, those partially under my control and those things completely out of my control 

i patiently went through the steps to claim compensation (if any)  i spoke calmly and politely to the respective customer service teams and now remain hopeful of a positive outcome but i know this to be beyond my control in this case  when the task was complete, i let the issue leave my mind and felt a deep calm overcome me and i moved on with my day 

 lt b gt posterior reflection  lt  b gt 

while this is not by any means a catastropic event, it has provided a valuable lesson and exercise in reclaiming my mind from a manifested state of chaotic irrationality  

i also reflected on how i could have easily missed out on this opportunity if it was not for that little voice reminding me of my comiment to stoic practice  for this reason i have taken it upon myself to create a psychogical anchor, a conscious, inwards probing of my mind, and a reminder to check up on ""the inner stoic""  i will achieve this by repeating to myself ""remember your stoic practice"" several times a day and when faced with adversity     "" what would marcus do?""

1,5 practical stoic quotes on productivity 
1," the man in the arena,  a quote from theodore roosevelt "
1,"stoicism  amp  suicide   ""for he in whom there are many things which are in accordance with nature, his duty it is to remain in life  but as to the man in whom there either is or appears likely to be a preponderance of things contrary to nature, that man's duty is to depart from life ""   cicero from an excerpt of cicero's work on stoic philosophy, we have one of the most succint takes on the stoic view of suicide and how it doesn't contradict any of its tenets  as there is polemic and division on this particular subject, it is important to return to the sources and not merely a surface interpretation from a modern perspective 

 amp  x200b 

 gt  for he in whom there are many things which are in accordance with nature, his duty it is to remain in life    but as to the man in whom there either is or appears likely to be a preponderance of things contrary to nature, that man's duty is to depart from life    from which consideration it is evident, that it is sometimes the duty of a wise man to depart from life when he is happy, and sometimes the duty of a fool to remain in life though he is miserable  for that good and that evil, as has been often said, comes afterwards  but those principal natural goods, and those which hold the second rank, and those things which are opposite to them, all come under the decision of, and are matters for the reflection of the wise man  and are, as it were, the subject matter of wisdom  therefore the question of remaining in life, or of emigrating from it, is to be measured by all those circumstances which i have mentioned above  for death is not to be sought for by those men who are retained in life by virtue, nor by those who are destitute of virtue    but it is often the duty of a wise man to depart from life, when he is thoroughly happy, if it is in his power to do so opportunely  and that is living in a manner suitable to nature, for their maxim is, that living happily depends upon opportunity  therefore a rule is laid down by wisdom, that if it be necessary a wise man is even to leave her herself    

of which this is said to be a wise decision, taken for the sake of staying within the reason of nature  for even life can be laid down in the service of virtue, it can also be taken in order to deny it from vice   as in the case of cato who chose to deny caesar the pleasure of letting him live in dishonor to humiliate his adversary  this is similar to another popular form of suicide called sepuku from the samurai tradition  once the samurai is stripped of all honor and has no more reason to live, he is to die as it were to maintain dignity  

however this isn't an easy task, and for those who are foolish, it is recommended to endure and continue learning 

 gt  wherefore, as vice has not such power as to afford a justifying cause for voluntary death, it is evident that it is the duty even of fools, and of those too who are miserable, to remain in life, if they are surrounded by a preponderance of those things which we call according to nature  and since such a man is equally miserable, whether departing from life, or abiding in it, and since the duration of misery is not any the more a cause for fleeing from life, therefore it is not a causeless assertion, that those men who have the power of enjoying the greatest number of natural goods, ought to abide in life  

hence, it is not to be taken lightly, and to seek respite from that misery with the use of virtue, and nowadays therapy and counseling  which makes this not a subject of dogmatic adherence to life as if it were an absolute good, but a matter of careful deliberation guided by wisdom  

lastly, seneca's praise to cato 

 gt  i am sure that the gods looked on with exceeding joy while that hero, most ruthless in avenging himself, took thought for the safety of others and arranged the escape of his departing followers  while even on his last night he pursued his studies  while he drove the sword into his sacred breast  while he scattered his vitals, and drew forth by his hand that holiest spirit, too noble to be defiled by the steel  i should like to believe that this is why the wound was not well aimed and efficacious   it was not enough for the immortal gods to look but once on cato    his virtue was held in check and called back that it might display itself in a harder role  for to seek death needs not so great a soul as to reseek it  surely the gods looked with pleasure upon their pupil as he made his escape by so glorious and memorable an end!   

but perhaps all of these authors were wrong and cato didn't really understand stoicism  he should just have not cared at all about externals and be so above it all that he could have just accepted the will of caesar  after all, letting people dominate you and humiliate you is stoic because freedom doesn't matter, laws don't matter, nothing matters! just that you, uh, remain in virtue or something  which only means to not care  that's what reddit taught me, after all  the most stoic thing is to not care, so cato was not stoic  or so i hear  oh man, whom do i listen to, the philosophers or the users? anybody have a clue what the real answer is?"

1,mark vernon   why modern stoicism misses the point   idler 
1,"how to accept that you will not be able to help someone who doesn't want to be helped? i know stoicism is mostly about focusing on what i can control but really breaks my heart to think that i have to give up on my father  he's in his late 60s and is morbidly obese    he has been since i was young  for so many years i've tried to get him to adopt a healthier lifestyle, but his ego holds him back  he's a very ""traditional"" male, who often refers to himself as the alpha of the family, is extremely egotistic, and is the epithet of toxic masculinity  i love him very much, and he does have a lot of very good qualities, but his ego is causing his destruction  i've tried to help him ease into different diets by adjusting his meals and dedicating an hour every morning to exercise (gently   because of his weight) with him  however, he always falls back to his binging and unwillingness to move around  he sits for 14 hours a day watching netflix  understandably, he is retired and deserve his rest, but even with me asking him just to stand up for 10 mins per episode causes him to retaliate  especially these few months, when his weight has been the heaviest it's ever been, he gets extremely angry whenever i try to suggest that he move around or at least get his own cup of tea instead of bossing my poor mother around (because he still possesses misogynistic ideals that wives should serve their husbands)  he also orders a lot of fast food and desserts daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, despite my mother cooking up healthy meals for him because they ""aren't his taste""  whenever i try to suggest that he eat better, it just turns into an argument and blames it on my mother for ""cooking too slow""  the other day, we had a full blown argument (more of him screaming at me) because he told me to stop nagging at him, proceeding to throw in a bunch of insults at me and my own insecurities 

i realise now that i truly can't help him if he doesn't let himself be helped because i think it hurts his ego when i try to ask him to be healthier, because he feels i'm implying that i think he is fat, and he is extremely insecure about his weight  it's quite ironic because he was actually the one who introduced me to stoicism, but he believes that anger and ego are necessities to survive life  and yes, i gifted him ego is the enemy by ryan holiday but it has since been donated away  i don't know what else to do but to let him be and live my own life better in the hopes of influencing his own lifestyle  i know that nobody is perfect, and other than his ego and anger issues, i think he has been wonderful father (not necessarily a great husband, though)  he doesn't have any other addictions like drinking, smoking, having affairs, or drug abuse, and he was never violent  he just has so much anger and impatience and ego still, guilt is eating me up, and i've read from meditations some time ago that i shouldn't give up on people no matter how difficult they are (i can't find the exact quote, but that was what i got out of it)  it is so difficult to watch him destroy himself especially now that he's getting older  i feel like i have to help him, but i know i can't, and i just find that so difficult to accept  it's just like i'm letting him kill himself  i don't know what to do anymore "
1,"pleasures keep me from comitting suicide all these mindless pleasures like surfing the web, food, porn etc  i feel are keeping me alive as even though they numb me, they also make me keep going through this suffering that life gives me  the only people i really have are my family, who i think are also as suicidal as me  

the only reason i keep going is because i can't leave my family behind and also because i'm curious to see what is going to happen to this world  i'm gay and i know i'll never reproduce  

i've been reading stoicism alot these last couple of years and one thing that i can't seem to do is to give up these pleasures as i can't live without them

1,"you don't have 'control' but 'power' over your thoughts  there is a difference correct me if i'm wrong but

there are days where a hollow thought can't stop poking my in the head, even when i have reasoned with it rationally, i wrote it down, stripped down impression and reasoned with it and figured the next action or if the thought is not worth pursuing or doesn't meet virute  

i expected it to be eliminated, but i woke up with it every morning, it pissed me off for weeks (maybe i kept getting it, cause i wanted to get rid of it), it still comes around from time to time, but i learned it the hard way,  we don't 'control' our thoughts, but we can accept them, get detached by them, not give up our power,realize we are not out (first hand) thoughts but what we do with them, then think rationally(which i believe is us, our truly own faculties) stripping out impression, viewing as a third person or from the above  then act on it 

bottom line   we are not out thoughts and feelings, we are what we do with them  

i believe when marcus said 'the thoughts of our mind color our soul' , he meant how 'we choose' to look at these things which our vessel (body hence brain) provides us with, which has his human errors, thats why we need to practice stoicism to overcome our old mentality, stripping out impressions, thinking over thoughts and how do we feel about them, what does it mean to you  and then have the power to influence it in whatever way you have examined it 

so next time you feel strong about of any thought or a feeling, just be self aware, observe, accept and examine it first   detach yourself, apply your tools and wisdoms you have to the situation, then use the power you have over your thoughts to take back control and influence your will by motivation and the eventual action  

what i think i did wrong   i hated the thought's existence in my mind, it destroyed my peace after it kept coming back and back again, instead i should ve also examined this feeling and realised it being there in my head does nothing to me, so i should not feeling anything about, cause at it literally was a hollow thought from my own fear of having that thought  i cannot control this kind of thought, my mind is a monkey, i can only focus on peace and the real thinking me stripping out everything else "

1," you haven t been acting stoic lately  i introduced my friend to stoicism and have offered to borrow him some of the staple literature i own  he likes to refer to himself as stoic and i believe he watches a few youtube videos about it every now and then, but i sort of worry that he misunderstands it for not caring about anything (among other things)  i do feel as if he only likes to call himself a stoic for the purpose of feeling trendy cool (i e  when he has girls over i sometimes hear him improperly explaining stoicism and talking about how he s stoic which is a pretty silly thing to do) but it s not really my place to judge, all i can do is offer my collection of books surrounding the topic  

i ve had a few arguments with our other roommate due to some of his actions which i perceive to be grossly unjust  i deliberated long and hard over whether or not it would be the wisest thing to do in the situation beforehand, and decided i needed to speak my truth 

now the friend who says he s a stoic is saying  you haven t been acting like a stoic lately  to me and i don t know how to respond  i want to tell him that he completely misunderstands stoicism, and that him bending over backwards to please our negligent roommate and walking on eggshells to avoid confrontation at all costs is not a stoic thing to do, because he cares more about pleasing others than he does about doing what he knows is right   what someone who has respect for themselves would do  

i hate to say it, but him saying this to me has been bothering me more than anything else lately, because i m very passionate about the philosophy and do my best to maintain virtue while he doesn t take it as seriously but likes to stroke his ego over the thought of him being a stoic  i don t know if i should explain why i did what i did to him and try to teach him or if i should just let him continue to misunderstand "

1,"stoicism, therapy, and wise mind (sorry if the flair i chose is incorrect  please let me know if i need to fix it )

hello everyone! i m quite new here  i had heard about and watched videos of stoicism before, but i ve started diving much deeper into it only a couple of weeks ago  this subreddit has been very helpful 

before i continue, i ask the readers of this post to correct me if something i say falls contradictory to stoicism  as i said, i m a beginner, and i m still learning, so any feedback will be appreciated!

when i was reading on stoicism, i immediately recognized how heavily dialectical behavior therapy (dbt) was based on it  dbt is an incredibly effective technique that is used to treat highly suicidal individuals, emotion dysregulation, treatment resistant depression, and more  it heavily relies on skills such as mindfulness, nonjudgmental approach, radical acceptance of reality, and more  those who are familiar with dbt will recognize how closely these practices are connected to stoic ones 

one of the core concepts of dbt is that us humans have three states of mind  reasonable mind is that in which we are ruled by facts, logic, and pragmatism  it is the  cool,  rational mind that ignores values and emotions  emotion mind is that in which we are ruled by emotions, feelings, and judgements  it is the  hot,  mood dependent mind that ignores reason  finally, there s wise mind  wise mind is described as  walking the middle path   it is the dialectical synthesis of both reasonable mind and emotion mind  it is the intuitive wisdom that exists within every person 

a goal of dbt is to teach the student to recognize which state of mind they re in at a given time and to find ways to bring themselves to wise mind if they re not already in it in the first place  dbt teaches us how to act  from wise mind,  skillfully and effectively, which sounds a lot like stoic behavior to me 

while i was practicing wise mind several days ago, i noticed that it s quite difficult for me to bring myself back from, say, emotion mind without following predetermined steps, so i decided to sit down and create a series of questions that could help me determine if i am acting wisely at a given time and, if not, determine what i could do to fix it  i combined everything i knew about dbt and stoicism into it  now, whenever i m spending hours looking at my phone whereas i need to do something else that needs my attention, i pull up the list on my phone, read it, answer the questions, and change my actions accordingly 

i decided to share these steps and questions here in the hopes that i could get feedback on whether they fit well with stoic concepts and teachings  i also wanted to be able to give some guidance to those like me who might need it 

here it goes 

how to get to wise mind

observe your state of mind  ask yourself 

which state of mind am i in? reasonable mind or emotion mind? label it  describe it  experience it  radically accept it 

what would wise mind compel me to do?

are my actions virtuous?  i added this question to remind myself to consider if my actions are hurting a fellow human being  

do my actions constitute as living according to my nature?  this is for harmful actions such as sleeping more than my body needs, eating too much or too little, wanting to eat junk food, spending three hours after midnight surfing reddit, etc  

do my actions violate my personal moral compass?

am i acting effectively? am i acting skillfully?

will my actions improve my life in the long term, or am i just seeking short term relief?

am i acting willfully? if so, why? is there a threat? if so, does this threat fit the facts of reality, or is it just my own judgement or interpretation of present or future external events?

if there truly is a threat, is it under my control? if so, solve it effectively  if not, imagine the threat really occurring  accept that you cannot change it  imagine coping well with the threat, then move on 

if the threat is merely a consequence of your thoughts or emotions, accept that you are thinking or feeling this way  experience and describe the thoughts or emotions, then, when it is time, let them go 

remind yourself  memento mori  memento vivere   i added these classic quotes to remind myself that there s still so much i want to accomplish in life, and wasting time doing unnecessary side quests that keep me in my comfort zone won t help

1,"does stoicism have an equivalent similar to tao s  wu wei , a state of  flow  where man effortlessly takes action without thinking or rational thought, but spontaneously through intuition alone, similar to instinct? a state of intense creativity you tapped into momentarily without effort, where you re being devoured with this linguistic, artistic, inventive, or whatever feeling it may have been in your particular craft, that pops out of nowhere flooding you with incredible ideas and limitless energy that almost override your neural circuitry, and then quickly leaves 

we ve all felt this before  that split moment we enter where we write without stopping, the words just pour out effortlessly, and we re left thinking afterwards  what just happened to me?   when you re so  into the zone  that for a moment, time stops, and nothing else but you exists 

another simple example would be the last 30 seconds of a sports championship final match  your body moves on its own  you have no time to think, strategize, rationalize, or plan  you act purely in the moment on instinct alone, spontaneously

1,"how do i deal with negative emotions associated with sex in my mind? for context i'm 22m  now i was in relationship with a woman 21 of age  everything aside while writing my emotions i realized something and i am not sure how to deal with it  

it was sort of a long distance and i engaged in phone sex  i liked it  my gf didn't so much  and she just eventually backed out of it  i took it personally  it caused me great amount of suffering to know that my partner doesn't feel the same way as i do about something i enjoy  all of the negative emotions and attributes you can think of came to me  i became self centered (as in what i was not getting from her without asking her what she wants) , i was too eager for sex, i felt envious that she has so much sexual experience and i don't , i felt these emotions so much that it drove me crazy enough to affect other aspects of life  i realised i felt so insecure about sex as if i needed a constant validation from her  
even after break up, this emotion of inadequacy because of sex affects me  now, there is a reason i am a virgin it's just not culturally expected of me where i live and i didn't want to go against tide for something as trivial(or so i thought) plus the amount of effort i had to put for this and the risk i had to bear was not worth it  but now, my mind wanders between ""am i just making an excuse for not having sex? "", "" could i even do it even if i wanted to? ""   it is only now that i have taken the hold of my life back  but these thoughts still haunt me 

i don't feel sexual attraction to just anyone  infact i only felt sexually attracted to my gf after we emotionally bonded  and this is all over phone sex not even real sex  

i am having a hard time fitting sex into my value system  
i am very new to stoicism and want to know what would be the stoic perspective on my issue  

(additional information, i could conveniently forgoe sexual pursuit in past and even romantic relationship f or that matter because culturally i am expected to put effort into career first and then my family shall chose partner for me ( i know a lot can go wrong there as well but i didn't see a reason to fight that norm back then) )"

today, a few of these exact moments happened, so each it did i caught myself    with the cat litter, i looked at it, got angry and said ""why the fuck isn't it clea   "" but immediately stopped, took a deep breath, messaged my sister and said ""hey hey, when you're home please make sure your cat's litter box is cleaned"", she wrote ""sorry, forgot, will do""   
 
i can give a dozen other examples, but is this how stoicism is supposed to work? each time i got mad i would catch, breath, and tell myself that i won't get mad at it  i would think about the ""issue"" a bit but didn't get angry ruminating about it

1,top 5 best stoic quotes on life 
1,"david releases new  10,000 puzzle ,todd tries to swallow natalies face "
1,"something that has always rubbed me the wrong way ""avoid toxic people"" i don't know why this has aggravated me so much, maybe its just the pure dismissal of other humans and taking 0 accountability  but when i was reading mediations it became very clear 

 amp  x200b 

 when you wake up in the morning, tell yourself  the people i deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly  they are like this because they can't tell good from evil  but i have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own   not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine  and so none of them can hurt me  no one can implicate me in ugliness  nor can i feel angry at my relative, or hate him  we were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower  to obstruct each other is unnatural  to feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him  these are unnatural  

 amp  x200b 

saying avoid toxic people implies that you should build this safe space around you, and not acknowledge the reality that everyday perhaps everyone you deal with will be rude and arrogant and lying and hurtful, but always to work with these people and to learn from this 

 if someone is able to show me that what i think or do is not right, i will happily change, for i seek the truth, by which no one was ever truly harmed  it is the person who continues in his self deception and ignorance who is harmed  "

i think about it mostly in the context of determinism  but is there other scientific discoveries that have reenforced or debunked stoicism?

are there other stoic beliefs that perhaps have been debunked?"

1,"my mother, multiple sclerosis, and coronavirus hi all,

i thought about where i wanted to post this for a while and thought i'd defer to  r stoicism 

for years i have dealt with my mother's multiple sclerosis disease, slowing advancing and making her life harder, ultimately leading to a roller coaster of emotion where i'm told she will die due to complications   one year it was a high fever   another it was she had a cough and her lung capacity was lowered, so she was at risk of not being able to breathe   yet another incident she had to have a surgery to put her under anesthesia and they were unsure if she would continue to breathe while put under   i've felt her death come and go many times now (each time she survives), each time feeling like one of a thousand small cuts leading up to an inevitable conclusion 

this time i was informed she tested positive for coronavirus   she is asymptomatic right now   i'm trying to remain positive, but part of me knows this could be the final straw   i've tried to think about what my future self would want my current self to do if things go awry   tell her i love her, record her voice, express gratitude for everything she did for me growing up 

stoics deal with the idea of death frequently   i'm not new to this idea, but it suddenly seems more real   my question for you all is 

what can i do now, in this moment, that i will thank myself for doing in the future?

thanks   "
1,what is stoicism? the philosophy for a great existence 
1,"i m unsure whether to move interstate to live with my father or if i should stay  i wrote a similar post a while back  though,  now i have a clear understanding of the pros and cons and that of benefits  

at the moment, i live in queensland, australia  it s basically north east of the country  i moved here after my parents split in 2016  i live with my siblings, my mother and her boyfriend  i live in a nice, friendly city  in fact it seems to give a good vibe   everybody says that  the weather is usually nice   although quite humid  all year round which is a great difficulty especially in summer  i have just graduated high school and have nice friendships  those whom i have been seeing since graduation (so far)  

why, then, do i wish to move? 

i have many siblings, one being a baby, and the house is quite crowded and very noisy  my mums partner can often come down on me  sometimes he expects too much of me  i do my chores daily but it s never enough to him and always looks at what s lacking  if i tell him what i do and ask why cannot he ask my other siblings to do those jobs that he finds incomplete (sister  16 and brother 13) he will spike up in rage   just do it and man up  well, i have been doing that  you cannot reason with him   not even my mother when she seldom finds the will to speak to him  in sum, he parents my siblings and i but more so me and picks on us for silly, unnecessary things  

if i move interstate to live with my father in south australia, i will be in a quiet, drama free environment  this is the place where i grew up  while i like the city i live in now no doubt, i think i like this place slightly better and i do miss it   that is he bonus  the consequence will be that i will miss my friends, and, i will be rejecting a direct tafe (technical and further education)
 entry in which i will study a counselling diploma  if i move it just means i have to reapply and i will most likely be studying online considering the distance of travel  

i feel like, perhaps, it might be a little more beneficial to stay where i am  on the contrary i feel like i might be happier if i move  at least, there will be less dramas and headaches  

i m currently visiting my dad interstate   so i have a good decent idea of what it s like to live here  yet, i am still struggling to decide and i must decide soon  i m not so good at making decisions and i hesitate "
1,a marcus aurelius reference in the new game cyberpunk 2077 
1,"this might sound crazy, but what is there to think about if you stop worrying about the thoughts out of your control? hi everyone  i have had a serious anxiety issue all my life, and as i m now trying to adopt stoicism and cease pointless worries about things out of my control, i ve found myself unable to fill that void  and it leaves me drifting back to the pointless thoughts and worries 

it s like, i can tell myself  ok, this thought is just another pointless worry, nothing more than a product of my anxiety   and that can kill it for a few seconds, but then i actually can t figure out what else to think about 

i ve tried focusing on my senses, my responsibilities, friends and family, but i can t figure out what to think about it all 

i know, i know  this sounds ridiculous and this is, like, a fundamental aspect of being human  but i don t think it has been for me as someone who s spent his whole life worrying about everything  negative thoughts plague me, and in my efforts to replace them, all i ve managed to do is curtail them for a few moments 

does anyone have any words of advice or guidance?"

1,"epitome of stoic ethics, arius didymus started reading things outside of the big 3 and came across this in the first paragraph   


 gt those things exist, according to zeno, which participate in the substance (a k a nature)  of the things which exist, some are good, some are bad, and some are indifferent    
 gt   
 gt these examples of good things  intelligence (wisdom), self restraint(temperance), justice, bravery(courage), and everything which is virtue or participates in virtue    
 gt   
 gt these are the examples of bad things  stupidity(obstinate or willful ignorance), lack of self restraint(intemperance), injustice, cowardice and everything which is a vice or participates in vice  

what caught my eye was the listing of ""anti virtues"" which got me to thinking about what the ""anti sage"" would be like  my best guess is that the as would be the type of person you would least want to take advice from but who's advice seems most tempting  being obstinate would keep you from having to reason about things so would be obviously the easier path, having intemperance would mean you never had to fight against your willpower to do things  you would simply do them with no thought to your character  injustice would free you completely from having to worry about others  and cowardice would free you from risk   it seems to me that for most people the ""anti sage"" exists inside them with no effort, she he is the voice that talks you into the next slice of cake or taking the tip off a waiters table after the dinner   the actual sage has to be constructed mentally, she or he is ""built"" literally from teachings and virtue and requires effort  it was a small thing to fathom but it lead me to contemplate my own sage and anti sage and the internal debate between them  it helped me finally hang a name on what pressfield called ""resistance"" in the war of art  this resistance is the anti sage "

1,stoicism in dorian gray 
1,"friend is telling me i ""haven't been acting stoic"" lately in regards to an issue with our roommate, but i think he fundamentally misunderstands stoicism  i introduced my friend to stoicism, offered to lend him my copies of meditations, letters from a stoic, epictetus' discourses, etc  he's sort of into stoicism and i think he often watches youtube videos about it  however, i don't think he's really diven very deep into it, and it honestly seems as if he's fundamentally misunderstanding it 

for example, we recently got a new roommate who has caused some issues (not cleaning up after himself, being extremely loud at 3 am, etc)  i don't have an issue with the noise (can sleep through anything) but my friend does and complains to this roommate frequently  i don't necesarily have an issue with him not cleaning up after himself either, normally he does it in time   it just takes a pile of dishes for him to actually fix the problem  i solved the issue by keeping my cookware in my room 

the problem is that recently he has been telling us to clean dishes that i know for a fact were his own doing  this is a clear injustice in my eyes, how can you tell another man to pick up your own mess, and try to gas light them into believing it's their mess? whenever he does this i immediately ""call him out"" on it  i don't make a big fuss over it, i just tell him that they're his dishes and his mess to clean  he normally responds by immediately breaking down and screaming  i raise my voice in return and don't yell, and just tell him to clean up his mess before exiting the converstion  he'll usually scream outside of my room a bit more and one time he even put the dishes in the garbage can, to which i responded by removing them and placing them back in the sink (they are not his dishes to throw away) 

my friend has talked to me about this, and told me that i ""haven't been a stoic lately""  i haven't really responded, i just shrug because i geniunely believe my actions have been the correct way to respond to a situation like this  i think he misunderstands stoicism, and don't know if i should say something to him the next time he brings it up  from what i've learned, it is your duty to call out a clear injustice   in fact, not doing anything about it is letting your ego get the best of you, because you care more about being a people pleaser than you do about what is right  i geniunely do not care if this new roommate hates me, i just want him to understand the fault in his ways  am i wrong to believe this?"

we get our ambition from doing a good thing because there is a good thing to be done  not for fame and fortune  

the culmination of doing good, doing right in a virtous manner, in the moment we are in will always lead to what we are here for  to be a good human being  

the rest is nice, and we should enjoy it knowing it will be fine as fast as it comes  however it is not the reason for being ambitious, and driving to grow and be a better person  

the better we become, the more we can do, and the further we can help others grow  is there any other reason to do anything?

stoicism has a way of sucking the life out of people at times  especially when we reflect on how meaningless we are and how death is always at our doorstep  add to that the fact we are not supposed to attach ourselves to anything outside our will, worry not about what is outside our control, and let's not forget we should not desire anything    what a bummer  

so understanding ambition for a stoic follower is important because there is reason to carry on  there is reason to do well, work hard, and be better  that reason lies in the work itself, because if we do not do it, who will?

1,"meaning of everything i have been thinking a lot about the meaning of life    and i have heard the stoic response, even thought if you would like, you could elaborate  

still i believe there is an even bigger question  

what is the meaning of everything, the porpuse of everything  

do stoics believel the universe has no porpuse? and if so, do we have a porpuse? ir does this means that life also doesnt have a porpuse?? 

and if the universe has a porpuse, what is it? 


if the answer is that the universe has no meaning and its all in vain, doesnt this question tear down the need for morality ir virtue? 

what are the opinions of stoicism? and your personal opinion, if you would like to answer "
1,"i got angry with a long friend of mine  thoughts? so basically last weekend i was at a party with at a friend's house that lives far away from my home, and my friend had a car and lives very close to my place (we've been friends for more than 18 years, but 7 of them we haven't stayed in touch due to high school) 

when it was around 2 am i sent him a text saying that i wanted to get back from the party with him because if not i'd had to wait several hours until someone else decided to get back to their house 

he read the message, ignored it, didn't say a thing and left me to go and pick up his girlfriend at some other place (that also happens to be close to my house)  in the end i had to wait until 7am until someone could drive me back 

last night he came to my place (i didn't invite him), we smoked weed and then when we had time alone i told him ""what you did last weekend with me was really low"" and then he started giving the stupid excuses like ""i was drunk, my battery was really low"" bla bla and a attitude of ""it's not a big deal"" not to mention that he didn't apologize 

i know it's not in my control his reaction to what i told him and i don't regret what i've said, but i still feel mad at him  

i just feel like he's a kid in so many ways and that pisses me off  i want to yell at him ""grow the f ck up""

i'm sure a lot of you have been in a similar situation before  how can i apply stoic philosophy to this situation?

1,"how to deal with other people's opinions? i can't seem to find the right balance  so in short, my job is in a non profit that works for the local government  we initiate all kinds of projects to stimulate sports participation, inclusion, help local sports clubs, etc 

this job is fun but very very politically loaded  everyone seems to have an opinion on how to solve these complex problems and how tax money is best spent  

i often try to tell myself that i cannot change the opinions of others  that i should just focus on the goal and regard opinions as noise  however, i keep having doubts about this   technically i can assert influence over opinions, right? and perhaps sometimes it's even a good thing to do? for example, when discussing matters with policy makers, advisory boards, etc   

is that where the balance is? having the courage to voice my own opinion, while at the same time remaining indifferent to how much it will influence other's?

1,"my parents never respected me hi guys,

so i just wanted to get my thoughts out and i would like to know if there's anything i can do about my situation  i'm pretty new to stoicism and i would like to know what a stoic would do in my situation  i am a 20 year old and i have a bad living environment with my family  as i'm explaining this, i will do my best not to be biased to the situation that happened to make me write this  my family is nowhere near as terrible as some of the stories i hear on reddit  this post will probably only mention some of the bad things they did, but they are still decent people  ever since i was little, my parents have always been extremely competitive  they would discipline me a lot as kid and that controlling nature only grew as i got older  they would beat me if i did something bad (which i understand) but they would occasionally just do things to take their anger out on me and give me slightly over the top beatings for minor things  for example, one time i playfully told my dad to get out of my room and he wasn't in the mood to hear it and he started to beat me  he had (still does) lots of anger issues  he told me ""are you the one paying rent?"" no apology from him for being stupid  there were several instances where they would beat me more to control me instead of just wanting to discipline me  i don't think  any of the beatings really made me mentally worse as i got older, i only saw my dad in a more distant way  as i got older the beatings became less but the punishments were still ridiculous  they would ground me for 30 days without any electronics every time i said a bad word in front of them  i stopped having conversations with my dad when i got to high school  i think my dad genuinely regrets some of the choices he made with me as a parent, but i can't be too certain  my mom is incredibly immature and narrow minded  she acts innocent and probably genuinely believes she's innocent when she guilt trips me into doing anything she says  she claims that she wants whats best for me when she literally blackmailed me into doing what she wanted  she would offer me gifts and things like that but then threaten to take them away when i got bad grades or didn't do what she wanted  so i pretty much owned nothing  i threatened to run away and she said to go wearing a t shirt and shorts (which she bought) as a sign of her mercy  no food or water  she was probably thinking i would never do it anyway  she loves to monitor me over everything  i am 20 years old and i still share a phone with my mom  and we are not struggling financially either  my mom did not let me leave the house to go and hang out with friends growing up, she loved to control everything  i used to be very extraverted but now i just feel lonely  my brother was caught drunk in high school by my parents and he turned into a very rebellious person  he got angry at everyone and my parents didn't know what to do with him  i guess they became scared of making him mad so he turned out to be someone who got a lot of what he wanted  he joined the marines and he changed only a little but still is very easily angered  after seeing what drugs and alcohol did to my brother, they made me a prisoner at home and basically wanted me to forget about the real world and my friends  they used him as an excuse and because this happened early on in high school, i believed them relatively  until recently when i got into college, i was able to leave the house every now and then  they would always check my breath when i got home for alcohol or weed  you would think that because i'm home most of my free time, they would let me enjoy myself every now and then with a movie or vide games, but every time my mom comes into my room and finds me not studying, she would yell at how i've always been lazy and unmotivated   unlike  everyone in my family, i am very laidback  i'd rather move on because this bullshit happens so much its yesterdays news and i literally forget about it the next day  but i don't think i forgave my dad  not really  it could be because we don't talk more than necessary  i'm starting to think that my mom uses my passiveness to her advantage and tries to control me even more  i've practiced stoicism for a little bit but i find it very difficult to grow further in stoicism when presented in a living situation that always seems unfair  there is more potential to grow in stoicism but it's very hard sometimes for a beginner like me  i can't exactly move since i have no money and my parents wouldn't let me dorm in college  my question is how can i forgive people and how can i make my parents respect my wishes  thank you very much if you read all this "

1,"natural stoicism (discussion)(brainspill) how did you discover stoicism and did you practice it unknowingly before you discovered it? i am curious about who is drawn towards stoicism and why  i have noticed in my short life that men are definitely more prevalent in the community and i generally just have not met a woman that claimed to know of or practice (not that they do not exist outside the rock i live under)  i am also curious if anyone else had a 'coming to stoicism' the way i did, almost unknowingly practicing discovering the thought process 

as far as my time with stoicism goes, it came to me very naturally  i do not know what triggered what i would always describe to people as ""an ultimate contentness""  i came to realize there was no objective good or bad in the universe nor any power out there able to invent good or bad  to plenty of people in my life and in the world, thinking that way is dangerous  my mother hates that i think abortion doesn't matter  it is not that it does not make me sad to dwell on, i just do not think that is 'evil' or 'bad'  this realization led me to that feeling of ultimate contentness  yes, i still feel sad, happy, angry, but i feel more controlled about it and more optimistic about life  

""but how do you feel happy if there is no good?""

well that's just the thing, everything is subjectively good or bad  as the human race grows in age and size we also collectively evolve as a society  because of this we are able to learn together what is 'good' or 'bad' for a society in general  not that this would or will ever work perfectly but i think it is pretty 'good' that rape is illegal where i live

despite this, somehow, his priorities became so distorted that he lost perspective on all of this and something in his life tortured him so much that he threw all of that away  i don t know what crept it s way in and nested in his mind   there was a test he had attempted to pass and failed a few times and i knew it was bothering him  i still don t know what the cause was or if he even left a note  it s tragic no matter what but if it was over a goddamn stupid test        ?!

1,"getting left behind by professional peers i'm 25  i had a rather terrible job until a few months back which i ended up quitting  this was when the pandemic was raging on in my country  while people might argue that it wasn't the smartest thing to do, i still stand by my decision since it gave me a much needed break in my career  now, i'm planning on applying to law school     and changing my field, something that i've wanted to do since i graduated (some 3 years back)  

firstly, money is not an issue since attending law school is super cheap in my country (admissions are based on an exam that i cleared with ease, since i really like the field)  however, the thing is, law school is a three year, full time program here  even before my earlier job, i had feelings of inadequacy with regards to my career  i was a lowly researcher working for peanuts, producing papers on obtuse topics that no one outside my field cared about  my peers from my undergrad were consultants, bankers   doing what seemed (to me) to be interesting work  i also felt some envy about the 'status' factor that these people had with such jobs   something that was well and truly absent in my own job 

now if i do attend law school, that's three more years of being out of the job market  i'll 26 when classes start next year, meaning that i'll almost be 30 (!) when i graduate  my peers, who already have such great careers, will have left me in the dust by then 

my problem is as follows  although i really do want to attend law school, and practice law as an advocate solicitor, i'm rather uneasy about spending so many years away from the job market, and in turn, being left behind (professionally) by friends and acquaintances  when i was younger (in school and undergrad) i was a somewhat precocious kid   skipping grades, double majors, etc  so to be left behind seems like an extra scary prospect  what would be a healthy way of thinking about this? 

    i should mention that unlike the usa (for instance), a law degree isn't really a big deal in my country (and not comparable to a 'fancy' degree like an mba or something like that) "

1,"stoicism for a better life   weekly exercise (december 9, 2020) hello there,

with the holiday season upon us, we are all adjusting to a new reality and new way of living  for many of us, it will be a holiday season without having the opportunity to see our loved ones  then again, thanks to the advent of technology, we can still get some visual time with family and friends, and with the vaccines on the horizon, it is safe to assume we won t have to go through isolation next year  so missing one year isn t so bad, however, we can t deny that this dystopian reality is still having an effect on people 

my government releases study after study on the increased use of recreational and prescription drugs, as well as the increase in sales of alcohol over the past 9 months  people are finding coping mechanisms  one such coping mechanism is shopping online  although this may be to the benefit of jeff bezos  overinflated pocketbook, i thought i would take the opportunity to share seneca s words of warning from almost two millennia ago, when he urges us to heed the perils of excess  this is from his work on providence 

 gt  if a man has always been protected from the wind by glass windows, if his feet have been kept warm by constant relays of poultices, if the temperature of his dining room has been maintained by hot air circulating under the floor and through the walls, he will be dangerously susceptible to a slight breeze  all excesses are injurious  

seneca went through ups and downs  at a certain point, he was one of the richest statesmen in the roman empire, and at others, he was penniless and exiled (when he had to give up his enormous fortune to nero in the year 62   after burrus died   to    you know    keep his head attached to his neck)  however, regardless of how much or little he had in his accounts and estate, he tried to never associate his happiness or sense of self virtue with his possessions  i specifically chose to use the word  tried  as he was (by his own admission) as fallible as the rest of us  but i digress 

a simple life is a happy life  lest we forget that happiness can be found in living according to our nature, and although we are not as draconian as our older cynic cousins, as stoics we remind ourselves that luxuries, comforts and excess weaken the spirit and our resolve, and it also gets in the way of the virtue (i e  working towards the betterment of humanity) that we pursue  those of you who listen to my podcast will remember the example of my pillow (or lack thereof) when i sleep, and how this makes me more virtuous  you will also recall that i consistently speak up against self deprivation, as self deprivation does not make you more virtuous in and of itself 

the ultimate lesson here is that things do not bring or take away from happiness  but buying things to distract ourselves and fill a void can cause harm  it causes harm to your pocketbook (debt can ruin a life), it causes harm to the sweatshop and child labourers and the workers jumping out of factory buildings into suicide nets, it causes harm to the planet as the more we buy the more things go into landfills, etc  overconsumption, though touted by capitalism to be the only good, is an evil and categorically opposes the virtue we seek 

  so this week, when you re browsing online as to what to buy, stop  objectively ask yourself if this purchase is necessary, or if it will make you or someone else more virtuous    have the courage to ask the question    will this purchase make the world a better place   and have the strength to walk away from it if the answer is no 

i wish you a safe holiday season  we re all in this together, and we re all rooting for each other

so i'd like to dive deeper into this, and i'm reaching out to learn of what stoic teachings might've helped you through hard times  are there any books or audible teaching from eckhart or other's with similar viewpoints you would reccomend? or even, any pieces of wisdom that have helped you to let go, and refocus on my productive ways of thinking? any insight will be greatly appreciated"

1,"""marcus does not offer us a means of achieving happiness, but only a means of resisting pain"" this is from the introduction of gregory hays' translation of  meditations   he describes the stoicism of the  meditations  as a ""fundamentally defensive philosophy ""

i used to be obsessed with  meditations  a few years ago    it was more or less my guidebook for living, and was a gateway to reading other works of stoic philosophy  i have picked it up again to see how it resonates with me now  meanwhile, i think hays concisely put into words something i wasn't consciously aware of  what led me to distance myself from stoicism was mainly that it centers solely around suppression without commenting on how to proceed once that has been accomplished  it imparts a sort of ""leveling"" of the human experience to the benefit self control, but perhaps perceivably draining some color from the experience in the process 

what do you think? is there room in stoicism for joy? where? what do we do once we've resisted pain (generally speaking)?"

1,"decided to write a poem for the first time in my life, and made it involve stoic views  our ship of peace rocked by waves, forever trying to uncoil,

yet they lie beyond our control, mankind forever in their bind,

ride not against them, for against the wind yourself you will only embroil,

solely steer yourself where you can, and to the path to peace you shall be aligned 

like an encroaching fire, ahead looms life's suffering and toil,

unbearable is but opinion, and by opinion we need not be defined,

peer earnestly inside, and one may unwind that this struggle you may foil,

discard judgement's counsel, and in yourself   a source of strength you may always find "

i'm trying my best to get started but i'm having a hard time getting started, i can't really buy anything online with the cash i have in my bag 

most banks won't even accept me because of my lack of information, i live with a family member so i don't even have any proof of address  i can't even get a drivers permit because of having no proof of address  i have a drivers license from the country i came from and law says i can use that for 30 days, but i couldn't get an insurance because i had no online bank account (they wouldn't accept the debit credit card from my country) 

i messed up and bought a pre paid cellphone number because its cheaper, but it turns out i should of bought a legit cellphone number because they would put my address on the bill, which i could of used for proof of address 

this, along with me missing all my friends and my immediate family back home is causing me a great deal of stress throughout the day, especially when i'm not doing anything 

i just think that i can't control most of these things, and i have a job lined up for me next week so i can use the address from there to get things started, but how do i remove the anxiety i just get out of nowhere in the present moment?"

gun owners  understand that you must be calm at all times while armed  stoicism is the way

1,"help a young aspiring stoic? college dilemma i am currently 18 taking classes remotely due to covid at a top tier university and i am paying almost nothing  sounds like a great situation which is why i feel bad for hating it  i was never studious and got in by the skin of my teeth after studying for the sats for ever (at the time i found passion for biology and wanted to turn things around and get into a good school)  but i have no passion and every career path through college i research just is boring to me 

at the same time i am super pumped about the prospects of becoming a real estate agent  i am starting the licensure course right after i finish finals week and hope to begin that path soon  i also have interest in starting a small service business, as i have done so before but in a field i dislike  but interest for schooling that leads me nowhere i am excited about? zilch 

i am maintaining decent grades but it is painful when i don't know what i want  i am certain i can get stellar grades if i were chasing a path i like, so i want to take a harmless gap year to explore my two options i discussed before  if i decide i do want to go to school instead, i could return with the same credits and fin aid package next year, no harm no foul, and i could actually go to school since covid should be over by then, if thats what i choose to do 

i personally think this gap year idea is great, the problem is my parents  they are open to my brothers doing whatever they want, trade school, etc, but when it comes to their eldest son, they want me to simply go to college no questions asked without regard for what i think  i believe it is because they are so excited i did well on the sats and got into a good school, and want to continue gloating about their high achieving and miserable little star student 

to make matters worse i am living in a goddam living room downstairs because i was ""supposed to leave for college"" as my brothers and even parents say to me  i saved 8k for them (they are paying for my college as of now which makes it even more complicated) by staying home since my college is tiny and has massive covid restrictions which i want zero part of  my younger brother took over my room since i was going to leave for college and he routinely treats me like shit  in fact, everyone does sometimes 

i am certain that even if i go against their will and take a gap year i would be allowed to stay in this household for free, but even if i were booted i have a car, macbook worth 2k, bunch of other valuables, 4k in stocks, 2 5k cash, and i worst comes to worse i can live in my grandmother's free tiny house for free or rent cheap and work a part time job  again i would seriously consider a return to the same school next year if things don't work out 

idk, please somebody tell me if this idea is smart or dumb or whatnot  i am even a bit situationally depressed and need some light at the end of the tunnel   "

 nature of any kind thrives on forward progress  and progress for a rational mind means not accepting falsehood or uncertainty in its perceptions, making unselfish actions its only aim, seeking and shunning only the things it has control over, embracing what nature demands of it the nature in which it participates, as the leaf s nature does in the tree s    except that the nature shared by the leaf is without consciousness or reason, and subject to impediments  whereas that shared by human beings is without impediments, and rational, and just, since it allots to each and every thing an equal and proportionate share of time, being, purpose, action, chance    examine it closely  not whether they re identical point by point, but in the aggregate  this weighed against that

1,"any advice for failing to be stoic in an extreme (for me) situation? hi there, so i(19m) have been trying to apply stoicism for about a year now and i have been making good progress  with many things, my natural response has been very stoic, and i have been quite happy with my progress 

however, on sunday (it s tuesday as i right this) i was admitted to hospital with a nasty infection in my leg  i am still here  the antibiotics didn t have much of an effect at first and the doctors seemed confused, and i just lost it  i started thinking that i was going to die, or lose my leg, and have spent a lot of time crying recently, both from fear and from pain  this is obviously not very stoic of me  now that my condition has been showing improvement i am much calmer and able to think logically about things, but am quite ashamed of myself for my initial response  i haven t been allowed visitors due to covid, so i have gone through this alone, which hasn t helped  

one thing that has come out of it is a reaffirmation of memento mori  i have genuinely (if irrationally) feared for my life since being admitted  additionally, i have seen some very sick old people  in fact, the person that occupied my current bed (i was transferred to a different ward today) before me died today, and were wheeled past me on their way to the morgue  i feel sure that life will seem much sweeter and more meaningful once i get out of hospital 

i was just wondering if there s a way to deal with feeling like you have let yourself down in your philosophy, as i have done in the past few days  i m quite ashamed and embarrassed about it  thanks in advance "

1,"best response to the disappointment of life author and speaker jim rohn on the best response to the disappointments of life 

""let s face it   people and events are going to continue to both hurt and disappoint you  among the people will be those you most love, as well as those you least know  seldom is it their intent to purposely hurt you, but rather, a variety of situations mostly beyond your control will cause them to act, speak, or think in ways which can have an adverse effect upon you, your present feelings and emotions, and the way your life upholds  it has been this way through six thousand years of recorded history, and your hurt or grief is not the first time a human has been deeply hurt by the inappropriate actions of another 

the only way to avoid being touched by life  the good as well as the bad  is to withdraw from society, and even then you will disappoint yourself, and your imagining about what is going on out there will haunt you and hurt you  knowing this, there is but one solution that will support you when people and events hurt you, and that is to learn to work harder on your personal growth than anything else  since you cannot control the weather, or the traffic, or the one you love, or your neighbors, or your boss, then you must learn to control you   the one whose response to the difficulties of life really counts ""

my thoughts 

first time posting here, long time lurker 

this reference was cited in the atomic habits newsletter, from the author of the book by the same name 

atomic habits uses quite a few stoic principles of analysing your actions, adjusting your perception of them adjusting them accordingly in order to develop better habits that support a more eudaemonic lifestyle that serves you and those around you better 

i felt this reference was interesting because it acknowledges that even though you only control your own actions, you can still disappoint yourself  the key is to how you deal with that and improve each time, so that next time you are a better person as a result of it "

1,"is there an exhaustive list of virtues? i've been exploring stoicism since early this year (before covid), and have come to understand that being a virtuous person is at the core of this philosophy  

wisdom, courage, justice an temperance are 4 virtues i see referred to as core virtues  i've seen other virtues recognized as well, kindness for example 

my question is, how are these virtues selected? i heard one explaination claiming that wisdom was the chief virtue, and all the others were derivatives of wisdom  christians, as myself, would claim that that which is aligned with the will of god is virtuous, and then many others have their own definition of what is virtuous 

everyone seems to have their own thoughts on what is virtuous  there seems to be no concensus  for that reason i must wonder, is a virtuous life up to the definition of the individual? i don't believe virtue is subjective, but i don't understand how a concensus could resonanbly be met  

i understand the question 'what is virtuous' is an ages old question, and has been discussed at length by philosophers "

i have to say how wonderful of a book it is, with many fantastic teachings  a majority of the verses(chapters) are on average half a page long  its really refreshing as someone who has a couple of mental health issues to read and ponder 

if you ever needed help with learning stoicism and applying or pondering in you life  its a great option  my favorite verse is 10, page 14  the literal 1st line is helping me conquer alot of shame i've held onto for 15 years 

""whenever a challenge arises, turn inward and ask what power you can exercise in this situation ""

1,"setting goals and shooting bows  when an archer shoots a target, there are three parts to that action  
 
first, the goal of hitting the target  it s fully under the archer's control  he will set the intention (why i want to hit the target) and decide to perform the action  
 
second, the action  making the shot  also fully under the archer s control  he can do everything in his power to make the perfect shot   check the wind, prepare the bow, take the correct stand  
 
third, it's the end  the reality of the arrow actually hitting the target  here, the archer is no longer in control  anything can happen   the wind can change, the bow can break  this is not under the archers  control and thus not something he needs to spend any time thinking about  
 
the only two parts you control in the progress towards your goals are having the right intentions (setting the right goals) and performing the correct action in the best way you possibly can  the rest we leave up to the universe to figure out  
 
it s not the results that count, for it never depends solely on us  it s the intention one has when seeking the result and the action we take to get there

1,"what s the point of being benevolent when others don t do the same? life is like the game survivor, in order to win, there has be a level of manipulation  in meditations, marcus aurelius mentions that there are 3 kinds of people  1 ) who help someone and immediately look for reciprocity 2 ) who are slower to look for something in return but who feel like the person owes them something 3 ) who, like a vine which bears grapes each season, move from one good task to another without expecting anything in return  if we believe that we must be aware of the good we did and also make the person whom we helped aware of it, he believes we belong to the 1st category  our duty is to be part of the 3rd category   help people without expecting anything in return 

however, what i have found practicing stoicism, is that you end up just being a good solider to the situation and end up getting all the work while other reap the benefit of complaining and getting no work  in a way, you end up being a pacifist  i also feel that you gotta remind people about your good deeds otherwise they go unnoticed  as the saying goes, the squeaky wheel gets the grease first  in politics, most decisions to get things passed is quid pro quo  i don t know, is my worldview just dark?

i know this for one thing because i am currently suffering now and while stoicism principles are relatable personally, i feel it is not helping me  it's a high level form of help 

talk to a person, preferably a person who is compassionate but would discipline you enough  i stay away from r relationship_advice and similar subs as i think these subs are full of people who just wanna feel power over others (how they write their responses, in my opinion) which would just put you down further

1,"memento mori  a dream that terrified me more than it should have i don't remember how the dream started  i certainly don't remember every little detail, so if it appears as if i am taking a little bit of creative liberty, then i most likely am  

the first thing i remember about the dream is the realisation that i have a token with the number 18 written on it  as i looked around, i saw that the room is a sort of waiting room with only a few other people in it  

i could see one of my friends partying it up in a house across the street and remember thinking to myself, well she still has time  i thought this because her token no was about 47,000 

but what is the token no for, i think to myself and what place is this? i closely inspect the people sitting there and find out that almost all of the people there were really old with the only exception being me  i was a 20 year old sitting amongst septuagenarians  amp  octagenarians  some of them were so old and weak that they were just waiting out their turn  but what were we all waiting for with tokens in our hands? it still didn't make sense to me 

some time later on, a person came into the room and announced something  an old lady rose up from her seat and followed the person out of the room but before she left, she threw her token on the floor  although i was surprised by this, i still looked at her token on the ground  it was no 13  i then looked around and found all the numbers leading upto no  13  like the number 11 in the corner  no 5 besides it  no 1 behind the leg of a chair 

i was still confused and was looking around but by this time, another person well into his nineties, started to stand up for his turn  he stared at me from across the room and whispered in his feeble voice, ""so young   so young"" 

this is the point where it all clicked into place and i understood what was going on  i just froze in my seat with tears welling up in my eyes  after some time, i looked across at my friend still partying and drinking  doing the things she wanted to do because she had time 

but i had run out of time  now, it was my turn to follow the person out of the room   as i was following him, all i could think was there was so much to do and so much to see   "

i'm not angry at ryan, i'm sure there's a perfectly good reason for all this, and it's all just externals anyway, but i think i've been pretty patient thus far and deserve at least some kind of response    i did after all spend 44 dollars (live outside the us, shipping is almost as expensive as the item itself) two months ago and got nothing in return for it so far, not even a mail of apology or explanation, nothing    

very curious as to whether or not i'm the only one experiencing this problem or if others are in the same boat as me  sorry if this post isn't appropriate for this subreddit, i have no idea where else to talk about this issue with other people  

i don't want to assume any bad intentions on the part of the daily stoic, but i'm really wondering what an appropriate wait time for a response is, whether i've waited long enough or if i'm being impatient, etc  because their website mentions that most of their orders are shipped within 2 days (!)  

i decided to ask for a refund and to cancel my order because by the looks of it they never even shipped it as i never got a follow up email saying that they did  

all i'm met with so far is silence  anyone else, or is this really just me facing these problems?"

i keep on having repetitive thoughts about the future not even in a good way  my brain had found it easy patterns to project those thoughts and keep repeating it again and again  even though it hurts, it would still keep on repeating again and again  i cannot explain why my brain keeps repeating a thought that it knows it hurts other than, it's an easy pattern and neurons firing together like a way for it to loop in the circuit  i am trying to be more present with my own self other than getting overwhelmed thinking about someone else  i feel like i am investing too much energy in someone's life that i am not living my own life  i cannot explain that but i am never in my own self now  even while writing this, i am thinking of someone else  does that make me multi tasking into many things at the same time  i keep on trying to bring back my attention to now than worry about my actions in the future and it's consequences  i am a firm believer in the energy of the thought and how it manifest itself in my physical world "
1,"""whatever, it happens"" i saw a post on here recently about the stoic art of shrugging   someone talked about how, after starting to practice stoicism, they started physically shrugging and using the shrug emoji         _( ) _   more   i think it can symbolize a lot of stuff   acceptance, contentment, wisdom, etc   and an overarching understanding that things aren't always gonna go your way, but the best way to deal with it is to understand that and move on   

to this, i would like to add the phrase ""it happens,"" which i've thought a lot about recently   it's a saying that i've heard all of my life but never really thought about   

you missed the bus?  it happens 

the water bill went up again this month?  it happens 

someone did something to you that made you mad?  it happens, people aren't perfect 

it happens   it happened   it will happen again to you or someone else 

most of the problems we face in our life are issues that have happened to others before   that doesn't mean they don't still suck or that you aren't allowed to take time to deal with it, but you should remember that you're not alone in the world and many people have survived that same situation   it happens, it's in the past, and now what you can do is decide how you will recover   

this isn't an excuse to justify your bad behavior, ie  ""why are you mad that i cheated?  it happens   ""  but it is a way to take a step back from whatever you're facing currently and find some perspective   tunnel vision is real, especially in high stress situations, but the sooner you're able to see the bigger picture the sooner you'll realize that maybe the world ending problem of the moment isn't as big a deal as you thought 

the next time you get up in your head about the inconvenience of the day  stop, take a deep breath, shrug and say ""it happens """

1,"the stoic party   ? i've long thought about going into politics but just can't see myself putting a r or d behind my name  i've even very seriously thought about running as a libertarian as i feel most aligned with their platform but i'm just not sure they're taken very seriously  sorry to any libertarians out there, i vote libertarian about 80  of the time but i'm still on the fence especially since many still view them as fridge or extreme  i mean joe exotic is arguably the most well know libertarian in 2020, just sayin

i'm also a student of stoicism and just finished  lives of the stoic s by ryan holiday and stephan hansleman and it was enlightening how political most of them were, some even claiming public service is required to be a good stoic  that got me thinking that we really need a stoic party  i know i'm not the first person to think this and even found a short article on the same but the question still remains, why isn't there a stoic party?  it seems that the simple principles of stoicism would provide a strong platform  and would be widely adopted in today's enviroment

1,"distinguishing philosophical branches from cult like ideologies? at what point does reliance and belief in ideologies become unhealthy? i understand that human psychology allows us to become completely enthralled in cult behaviors, closed to external criticism (giving us a sense of moral superiority in a way) and i was wondering how stoicism allows us to not fall into that trap? i find myself happy within my beliefs and ideas about the purpose of life, the meaning of life etc but how can i ground myself and keep my relations with the world healthy? i don t want to become too lost however i need to keep myself sane and content 
i ve always heavily criticized religions and cults etc for not wanting to  face reality  about the pointlessness and sadness of life but now i m worried that i will end up falling down the same delusional hole  maybe i ve got the complete wrong idea, but that s why i m here asking because i don t know where being a stoic stands "

i've been trying to let go of these dream worlds since they have essentially become a safe haven for all of the jealousy and ungratefulness i've been trying to remove from my life however i've found great difficulty in doing this as its become almost like second nature 

well i intend to continue training my self to stop this habit i wondered if perhaps others had come up against a similar problem and perhaps would have some words of advice for my situation  as of this moment my only real strategy has been to draw my self out of these fantasy worlds and consciously acknowledge that this was something and done and not something i want to continue doing, as well as not allowing myself to voluntarily and consciously slip into this state of fantasy, although it does sometimes still happen as i've mentioned its often become second nature when my mind begins to wonder "
1,"losing time    our greatest vice  

   i say, let no one rob me of a single day who isn t going to make full return on the loss       seneca   

would you give 1000 euros to a stranger? just like that, for no apparent reason, would you? or, if you had 86400 euros and lost 10, would you spend it all away in return of those 10?

no, you wouldn t 

this is a metaphor for money and time  the first question introduces the topic of when we lose time for no apparent reason  we procrastinate all day instead of getting closer to our goals, our objectives  or even, we procrastinate all day to avoid having goals and by doing so, avoiding failure  that s not only cowardliness as it is senseless 

our time here is not short, we just waste most of it  did you know that a normal person who has a regular job can, by the age of 60 have  professional  skill in 10 different activities, following the 10 000 h rule?

this means that by the age of 60 if haven t done anything but work and procrastinating, you have lost 100 000 hours  think of that number, 1 year has 8760 hours 

no one is about to become good at 10 different hobbies but think how much time we lose  find something to follow  become your master and don t serve the bad habits of your emotions  don t suppress them but do your thinking 

moreover, if someone says something bad about you, don t let the whole day be changed by that person  will you waste all of the time overthinking about a thing that is not of your responsibility? you simply cannot control what people say 

you can control if you care  don t

marcus has an entry describing an event occurring not as unfortunate but fortunate that it has happened to you, as you were prepared for it  example below 

my wife and just finished grocery shopping and got in line to checkout  the cashier we had was a new employee with a large  trainee  sticker over her name tag  she was older woman in her 60 s at least  we could tell she had a hard life, and i assumed she must really need this job to have been a new employee in a job like this at her age  it was very crowded, and i live in a region where people are well known for being rude and unfriendly  i find this stereotype to be generally true unfortunately  

there was one person in front of us, it was the shortest line by far  when we got up to her, she was clearly frazzled, in over her head, and furiously trying to make up lost time because of her errors which only caused more errors  she restarted our order several times as we pointed out mistakes that she was oblivious to as she was scanning items and keying in produce  at one point she keyed in a bag of loose apples as 1931lbs, i assume that it was the produce code for the apples  she restarted our order as she didn t know how to fix it  it took her close to 35 mins to complete  most customers behind us scoffed and changed lines  

we were patient and kind with her  she apologized a few times  i ran the above stoic wisdom over in my head as it was happening  i began to think of all the impatient and unkind customers she will or have likely had  or her leadership, which to my observance had virtually abandoned her  

in the past i don t know if i would have been as patient or as kind  i felt a mix of emotions afterward  sadness for this lady who is likely having a very rough day, and gratitude for stoicism allowing me detach from my own inconvenience and treat this stranger with kindness and patience  

i hope this comes across as introspective and not as virtue signaling, as that was not my intention "

now i truly understand the pain of losing both these senses, i am not able to smell a fresh cup of coffee in the morning, freshly cut grass, the scent of your partner, or the taste of their lips  it s as if i m numb to mother nature and now i feel a longing for my senses to return, it truly is saddening once the reality sinks in that you will not be able to smell your favorite cologne or perfume, taste your favorite food, smell the wet asphalt after a rain for the foreseeable future

2  i treat everyone equally and with respect 
3  i never get involved in conflict  always been the one to give out positive and happy vibes 

 i think these are good qualities to have, but unfortunately these qualities can be misinterpreted as weakness and an opportunity to be taken advantage of  

i have always been like this because i was taught from a very young age to be friendly and nice to everyone 

my whole life i have felt like i have never respected enough because of these weak qualities  i sort of get treated like how a person treats their servant  

i done being nice and friendly
i'm done smiling all the time
i dont want to be that person anymore
so here are my questions  

1  is it possible for someone who has been nice and friendly their whole life to change completely into someone who doesn't express emotion? (sort of like a tough guy kind of vibe)

1,"what would a stoic do (in this situation)? over time in quarantine, i befriended a person, and that person and i got along quite well  we had our arguments but we resolved them accordingly  towards the end of this year, i was fortunate to befriend another individual  at first, both of them got along (almost)  however, with time and situations, i somehow started to cause issues with each other (unknowingly)  each of them has an undertone of a problem that they ""dislike"" each other but never have shown while they speak to each other explicitly    


i wasn't a very good friend to the first friend i had made, and i will be re evaluating my friendship with that person as time goes on  furthermore, the second friendship that i had made argues that the connection between the person themself and i should be demoted to just acquaintances because it's causing an issue with the first friend i had made, which is stupid because it isn't really      


it is a triangular of friendship where i don't understand whom to be friends with and whom i don't  i have mentioned to both of them that i either stay friends with both of them, despite their relationship with each other, or none of them    


i am not going to go into r relationship_advice or anything  i just want to know how to approach this dissonant issue with the mind of a stoic  i live in a student accomodation building, and i will be leaving soon  i don't want to leave with any bad blood and wish to resolve this maturely    stoically  )"

1,"need help resolving anger towards repeated stupidity committed by my wife  so it's 4 23am for me right now  i have a final exam on quantum mechanics tomorrow, and i can't fall back to sleep because a fan in the bathroom fell down 2 hours ago  why would a fan fall down you ask? well, there's been smoke smell coming into the bathroom of our apartment  after trying everything to no avail, i decided to just seal the fan with duct tapes and it worked  the smoke smell stopped  but then my genius wife still kept turning on the sealed fan for the past few weeks, despite me telling her that it makes no sense  so tonight, once again, her stupidity culminated to waking me up the night before my super important exam  (after i was so very careful with my sleeping schedule for the past month or so no less )

well, maybe now you're thinking that it's probably not a big deal  people make mistakes   well, my wife here just could not understand how to keep the printer ink stocked no matter how many times i try to teach her, keeps locking herself out for 7 times in a row, drops her phone into the toilet and having to pay for repair multiple times   these examples are just the tip of the iceberg   would take too long to list all of her blunders   though some of them are actually kind of funny  anyways, you get the gist  

so right now i'm just like at the end of my rope here  trying to act stoic and push down my anger  still, it's just so very hard  this time i actually did not yell at her when it happened and calmly fixed the fan again  so there's progress, but seriously, thoughts of getting a divorce in the future still linger in my mind   are there any stoic advice on something like this? i honestly could use some guidance on anger "

i have been at a training for the past few months and live there sunday friday and get little to no free time during this time  i am now quarantined at home, alone in my apartment, and i have found myself with an excess of time  does anyone have any good readings, practices, or simply things to do with this time that will be productive and positive? thank you in advance "
1,"dear practicing stoics, what do your ethics say of this topic? as a reader of the texts of seneca, epictetus, and of course our main homie marcus aurelius, i find myself enthused by stoic ideals  (shout out to my boys chrysippus, zeno and rufus )
i've been reading and finding comfort in these texts for most of a year now

why do you choose to infringe upon the ataraxia of non human animals unnecessarily?

1,"according to stoic philosophy, why should we strive to be virtuous? trying to improve ourselves in regards to the four cardinal virtues can be very hard at times  it s at those times when i ask myself why i am trying to hard to be virtuous  and i haven t been able to ground a good answer  what does stoicism have to say about this? why should we strive to be virtuous?"
1,"just a thought about stoicism the hybris to accept this condition called life and just to move according to nature is merely a disguise for our attempt to stand above all if this  which eventually will be shattered through the mundane and we convince ourselfs to believe again 
otherwise we brake this circle  just walking without going anywhere, just further from the doubt "
1,"stoicism is good my for my life, not for my aspiring career tho it seems(music), how is yours? i want to become a rapper, before stoicism rap was all i had  my emotions rode on it, i vented through writing still then, but in creative way and it was for the music, also pouring emotions out were eizy pizy  

now i write in the journal, first thing in the morning but obviously, i write about my life and revise stoicisim, my emotions are all settled (though i need to work alot alot on mentality), my life is sorted, i 'm literally doing well, i feel like i have all the answer up till now in life  but i can't write or think like before or pour my emotions out, cause i don't dwell on it now, i just examine my problems and fix shit, cause now i got the tools  

i know stoicism obviously doesn't cover music, but i was wondering if there is anyone here who had any different kind of 'loss of something' which they had before or any other musicain?"
1,5 thoughtful stoic quotes on death 
1,"extreme ownership vs stoicism i've been a firm believer of the extreme ownership mindset for most of my adult life and i'm intrigued to know other people's opinion on how this relates, balances and clashes with stoic teachings  

idea 1  one should take responsibility for everything that happens in your life (no matter if it was you it fault or your assigned responsibility)  

idea 2  we only have control over the effort we extert into a task not the result of that task  we should try out best to live with virtue while knowing that the end results are not within out control  

to me these two views seem to somewhat contradict each other with idea 1 stating that you should bear the weight of all outcomes on the shoulders while idea 2 stated that you should bear the weight of no outcomes, only the effort 

i have my own thoughts of how they reconcile but i would be interested to know other studying stoics' opinion too

1,"giving in to emotions or dealing with them? i've gone on an undertaking to fix the situation i've placed myself in  occasionally i find myself overcome with emotions with the strong urge to cry  i've never, and will never, cry in public or around people  when i'm alone and struggling i cry all the fucking time  i don't know whether i'm dealing with my emotions by crying and letting it out, or if i'm being irrational and letting my emotions get the best of me  remaining stoic i understand emotions come and go whimsically, but i find myself at a crossroads of whether i'm letting these emotions out or being weak by giving into them

1,"""a sound mind can neither be bought nor borrowed  and if it were for sale, i doubt whether it would find a buyer  and yet unsound ones are being purchased every day "" i recently finished re reading the robin campbell translation of seneca's  letters from a stoic  and would like to share my thoughts on the following quote 

 gt ""a sound mind can neither be bought nor borrowed  and if it were for sale, i doubt whether it would find a buyer  and yet unsound ones are being purchased every day ""   
 gt   
 gt letter xxvii  seneca  letters from a stoic (classics) (p  75)  penguin books ltd  kindle edition 

i find this quote very relevant in the context of modern society  wherever we turn, there is someone offering a quick fix for our lives  whatever the problem, goal, or desire, someone is ready to sell us the solution  this could be how to advance your career, deal with anxiety or depression, find meaning in your relationships, optimize your productivity, lose weight, stop an addiction, etc   a lot of this advice is actually harmful and motivated by profit, yet we eat it up  perhaps this is because it is easier than looking inward, being honest about our flaws, and then putting in the hard work to correct them  cultivating a sound mind is not easy and no one can do it for us  even if it were for sale, no one would buy it  this is because our values and aims are often so out of touch with the values that actually lead to a happy and contented life

all right, but there are plenty of other things you can t claim you  haven t got in you   practice the virtues you can show  honesty, gravity, endurance, austerity, resignation, abstinence, patience, sincerity, moderation, seriousness, high mindedness  don t you see how much you have to offer beyond excuses like  can t ? and yet you still settle for less

while reading, i completely shifted my approach and perspective to life, and began a journey to approach life with equanimity, learn to realize that i have complete control over my opinions and happiness, and vow to live each day virtuously  despite making many other changes to my lifestyle, i believe that my adoption of stoicism has been the single greatest contributor to my current happiness  i can honestly say, that despite all the uncertainty and lost opportunities that the pandemic has brought on, i have never been happier, more content, and my stress and anxiety has virtually disappeared  anxiety episodes and regularly occurring ocd feedback loops are a thing of the past

1,"good description of stoicism i've been trying to practice stoicism for a bit now, but now i have a presentation in school and need to explain stoicism because the poem i am presenting talks about it  i feel like my definition doesn't really give a fair description of it, nor does wikipedia, so i am asking the community for it, if you could please send me a good definition i would appreciate it "
1,"ruminations about my current challenge   alienation of spousal affections i'm sure this is not an original post, as i am facing a thoroughly un original problem  i've done my searching through previous threads, which has been helpful  i've also started reading and seriously thinking about stoic teachings 

my facts  i am married to a spouse who is no longer physically attracted to me, although we share some social interests and are still cordial to each other  i have improved my health over the past year, and her affections have not rekindled  absent physical intimacy, we are seeking therapy both as individuals and as a married couple  we agree so far that the prospects of reconciliation appear to be distant, and we do not understand why she has lost her interest in me  without physical intimacy, i will not remain in the marriage and will pursue divorce, so that i may find another match who will be happier with me 

i am seeking ways to look upon this from a stoic viewpoint, to remove the unhelpful emotions and to find the best solutions overall 

a few of my thoughts 

 1  accept ephemerality of circumstances and also of my own emotional responses  

it is difficult to put the personal negative responses   bitterness and anger   behind me, but this is nonetheless a worthwhile goal  bitterness and anger do not help me deal with the situation, and they tend to only worsen the quality of the choices i make, and distract me from actual improvement  yes, i can recognize that i am sad about the situation  yes, i can accept that i am in some degree of pain  now, i must choose how to act upon this input  self pity on the one hand, all the way to unrestrained anger to the other hand, are all equally useless in moving forward  acknowledge the pain but seek to rise above it and return a stronger person 

 2  take a larger view, from above (outside of my own head)  

maybe i contributed to the problem myself  it is not clear what role i myself have played in the diminution of my wife's affections to me  i may have taken actions that made myself unattractive to her  it is worth the therapy to learn more about what actually happened, and in so knowing, ""know thyself""  even if this marriage is irreparable, these lessons are worthwhile to better build future matches  given the choice between blissful ignorance, vs  the knowledge to stop making the same mistakes repeatedly, which one would i choose? the choice is obvious 

 3  practice poverty and misfortune 

prepare for the worst case scenario so that i can accept it, if it does come to me  it is entirely possible that, despite our best efforts we cannot reconcile physically  this would mean that, despite our otherwise positive relationship, a fundamental definition of our marriage is gone, and we can no longer be married 

if this does happen, it is not productive to dwell on recriminations  ""if i had tried   "" ""if she had tried   "" what's done is done and we need to move forward  also, as a legalist outlook in today's modern world, this means taking care of the divorce procedures in a responsible and adult fashion (including virtuous conduct on both sides) 

 4  recognize what i can change and what i cannot change 

if my own conduct as a life partner was responsible for her alienation of affections, then it is in my power to change my conduct  (and it is not within her power to do so, so the problem and the solution both lie with me )

if, however, it is an internal change specific to her, then some element of the solution will forever be outside of my own control  she may, or may not, resolve this in a way that reconciles us  i cannot control this and therefore i should not concern myself with this 

also, as long as i behave virtuously and honestly to her, there will always be some element of her own happiness which lies beyond my direct control  i should not assume responsibility for her happiness  years of doing so has not actually made her happy as a result 

 5  memento mori   remember that my days are limited 

if i end this relationship ranting and railing at fate for my ""lost youth"" and ""throwing away my best days of my life"", does that help recapture the time? no  however,  i still have a decent number of days left in my life to work with ( it is within my control to choose to leave this marriage and seek another match (hopefully armed with better self awareness so that i do not poison that relationship the way i may have done here)  yes, perhaps the loss of my bygone days is now beyond my control  but the thousands upon thousands of future days are entirely mine to apportion as i see fit 

 6  distinguish between an indifferent external circumstance and a moral good or vice from my own reaction

it's possible that, even if i comport myself virtuously and generously, this may still end up in the dissolution of my marriage  this is not a failing, since the end result is beyond my control  i must work to not be distressed at setbacks and failures from circumstances  i must work to be master of my own responses, to treat my spouse with honor and honesty while we work through this difficult challenge  i must accept the possibility that her natural end state has no room for a husband like myself, but nevertheless to help her find the end state and be honest and true to herself 

what i can control is my reaction and my outlook  do i seek to stand firm for my true self and hers, or will i cowardly bend myself out of fear of losing her (or aggressively force her to yield to satisfy my base selfish desire to possess her)? if she must depart, will i seek to give her a solid foundation to be happy on her own and to allow myself to be happy on my own? when she needs my input for her own quest to ""know herself"", can i give her support and assistance honestly without self serving and self interest?

 7  discipline and repeated practice even when times are difficult 

since i started reading stoic thought, my mindset and mood have improved tremendously  previously, my attitude towards my marriage was primarily betrayal (""years ago we thought our love would be one way, and now my wife has changed and our love is gone"") and bitterness (""she has done this to intentionally harm me and i wish to see her in distress for revenge"")  stoicism has allowed me to step back, to accept that the universe and the people in it can change for seemingly inadequate reasons (or indeed no apparent reason at all)    and that i can accept this without rancor, without impugning my own existence, and without needing to ascribe some malevolent motive to the person undergoing the change 

so far, stoicism has provided me with many beneficial insights   perhaps because i was coming to it from a place of minimal perception, except for the perception of pain all around me 

however, it is possible that i may suffer bad days in future  where the message of stoicism is lost in emergent events or a rush of emotions  i have constructed a short daily routine of reading and thought (although i'm trying to get better about writing) and it is my plan to continue this even when the message of stoicism is drowned out temporarily 

it is easy to adhere to a discipline when its fruits and bounties are numerous  when the discipline's fruits are more implicit, or when they require patience, then the true exercise of self control comes through 

 gt  my pain is not unique  it is not even original 

 gt  to the uncountable millions passing by, my pain is of no consequence 

 gt  if they can set it aside so easily, then someday so can i "

1,"should virtue be put on a pedestal? let's use humility and napoleon bonaparte as an example 
  
in my study of napoleon, i've realized that the man did not have much humility  he was capable of being nobel, wise, inspiring, and sometimes empathetic, but he rarely had humility  he always strived for power for a good cause he would say  i'm not particularly dissecting the man himself, but the result of his actions  
  
the first half of his career was glorious, creating a republic revolution throughout europe and having all of its people question the aristocratic system  eventually paving the way for democratic republic governments and abolishing the aristocracy  his lack of humility helped pave this way 
  
the last half of his career was devastating resulting in catastrophic losses  napoleon sold new france (which was almost half of america) to spain to build a french navy fleet that was eventually obliterated by the british  and the horrific loss in the russian campaign, which led to the loss of 500,000 men and ultimately the french republic  his lack of humility also paved this way 
  
i feel that if napoleon was at least balanced in humility then things would have ended way better  but if he had too much humility then he wouldn't rise up in the ranks to push the french to become a republic  so my question is  is it better to put virtues on a pedestal or should it just be a balance?"

on one occasion i started writing every problem i was going through at that time  every sunday i would find the time and write each problem i was having during that week  maybe this will keep them off my mind a bit  as the weeks came by and past, i would read through what i had written from previous sundays just before i write down the current week s problems  i then started to unconsciously strike off the problems that no longer existed as i read through  

to my discovery every problem i had listed over the weeks that still existed or crossed out made me look back with shock  either those problems i resolved easily or they were plain worries that dissipated all on their own  over a period of 44 weeks, i wrote down 138 different problems  today, on the last month of the year none of those problems holds any weight on me  this does not mean that all of the problems disappeared no, even those that still persist today from over the weeks have not unfolded as ugly as i had perceived them in my mind  

this led me to a simple calculation  imagine on average how a human gets worried sick about 2 or 5 issues a week and gets to live 56 64 87 years  how many of these problems do carry weight on you? now if i tell you to stop worrying, that will make you worried  you will worry not to be worried, or when will i stop worrying about the futility of life and the loop keeps going  ultimately, we never stop worrying  even as i crossed out previous problems and wrote new ones something always bothered the soul until it didn t, and that is ok  that is because we are alive and life teaches us in our own ways how to adapt to our own situations, to move on, to live until we don t "

1,"tame impala, kevin parker makes songs with underlying stoic lyrics and or principles i love them him but only just came to realise the lyrics and titles are of ""embracing"" nature than ""fighting against"" 

before i begin, i understand songs are open to interpretation and you have your own subjective take on it  here's mine   

 amp  x200b 

  1)   take    let it happen   ( for example  the song title speaks for itself  

the lyrics explains how fighting against something over and over again feels  hollow, empty  the more you fight against it, the more it's going to want to eat you up from the inside 

so just     let it happen  straightforward

 amp  x200b 

  2)   this one goes under the radar because it's not on any album and was released as a single     patience   (

look at his songwriting  it's transcendence, for me

 ""just growin' up in stages   
 livin' life in phases   
 another season changes   
 and still my days are shapeless "" 

embrace all the seasons  

people like the idea of reminiscent, i like it too and i'm no different 

however, it feels like people dislike what they are living at the moment 

young people wants to be old and mature  or at least look old and mature 

old people wants to be young again  youth that could never be returned  this is a sentiment i'm getting lately 

 amp  x200b 

  3)      nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control   ( this! this is the epitome of it 

it goes back to 1), the more you fight against the current, the deeper you'll be in despair  this song could also be his existential crisis tipping point 

"" hey, what are you doing out here?   
 you're thinking about everything, aren't you?   
 i know it's crazy, but just don't think of it like that   
 nothing has to mean anything "" 

this song could also be a breakup song as well  

"" lose the fight, yeah   
 but it's alright   
 it wasn't our decision "" 

there's  a variety of interpretation here so just take it at its superficial level 

 amp  x200b 

  4)      sun's coming up   (

i took this comment from genius, a prominent lyric interpreter 

"" i wasn't daring, not much a chancer "" 

most actions beset for kevin are those that happen to come to him  not much of a go getter or an opportunist, he lives life as if it were a wave and continues it in a casual flow  this explanation of being a realist and letting life take it s own path can be later seen in  currents  in the first release   let it happen  ( 

 amp  x200b 

  5)   my personal favorite,    alter ego   ( not just because of the tune but the depth of the songwriting  i couldn't even put in words what i feel about this, but he managed to write a song and produced it 

"" get them to love you   
 while they may, depending on your words and wealth   
 the only one who's really judging you is yourself   
 nobody else   
 nobody else "" 

it's introversion writing, where the lyrics are dialogue happening in his head, and then put in words  he lived in his own head producing album, innerspeaker, to which i dare say it's one of the most intriguing songwritings i have ever come across with 

i could take everything too seriously by incorporating so many different meanings and ideas into the lyrics, when in fact, he didn't mean any of these  these are definitely the most interesting parts of music because it's open to interpretation and everyone's vary according to them, and that's okay for me "

i'm angry because he gave me some advice that blew up in my face  but i understand he was only trying to help, and the advice was based off of his own experiences  he could not have known our situation to be so different from what little i was communicating back then  the worst part is this was years ago

thoughts?"
1,"being stoic when things are going very well is just as important ive found that a big part of being able to control my emotions and reactions to bad events is how i handle the happy joyous ones  i find it easier to remind myself that good times are temporary which makes me cling to them less, it allows me to enjoy them in the moment for what they are without trying to keep myself in them longer than is possible or healthy, and prepares me for when they inevitably end 

it also, conceptually, builds inside of me the understanding that i often have little part to play in constructing the good events, and therefore the same with the bad ones 

obviously good habits can engender good outcomes and vice versa but ive found that if i focus on my behaviour too much, i find mysrlf wondering why bad things happen despite good behaviour  so i default back to nonengagement with those kinds of feelings and focus only on present action and present mind  each day trying to do the kind of work that is necessary for me to grow as a person, make the right decisions and live the right way

i m going to try my best to describe this, hopefully this helps someone 

imagine your life is a box  inside this box, you have a ball  we will label this ball  grief   also inside the box we have a button  we will label this button  pain  

when the event that causes grief first occurs, the  grief  ball is large, almost the size of the box itself  no matter what you do, practically just by living life, the ball will hit the  pain  button  and it will hit it over and over again due to the size of the ball 

as time passes the  grief  ball gets smaller  as it gets smaller, it is less likely to hit the  pain  button  but even after a long time passes, there is still a chance that the ball will hit the pain button, no matter how small the ball is  the button never changes, the pain will always hurt the same  and the ball never goes away, it just gets smaller  

eventually we must accept that this is the case  our pain never goes away, it is just less likely to surface as time passes  what we can do is try to control our thoughts about the pain "

 amp  x200b 

i was a nobody my freshman year of high school  this was due to me coming from a smaller middle school and not knowing the bulk of the school's population  my sophomore year came and i learned the social dynamics and just kind of naturally became friends with the popular kids, putting me in the popular ""group""  parties, girls, drugs, and constant social stimulation dictated my life  i was living in the moment and hadn't thought much of the future  the end of the year comes and my middle school bully somehow finds his way into the group and publicly picks me on me to the point of me disliking my friends for not standing up for me (i was skinny and part of my bullied middle school experience was being physically hurt by this individual)  my ego was shattered, as my top position in the stupid high school social hierarchy was falling apart in an embarrassing fashion 

so i win some random essay competition at the very end of my sophomore year that my english teacher made the class enter for a grade  i only did the work for the grade, so the fact that i somehow beat out whole school district surprised me and made me feel a little better about myself (i was completely isolated from everything at this point)  the prize was a partially paid summer trip that i could choose from a number of locations  from cooking in italy to sports in brazil  i chose to go to tanzania and live with some tribes because i really wanted some adventure   the first time i was ever on my own i was drinking goat blood, living in a mud hut, dicking around with maasai warriors, eventually living in a commune that was run by a black panther who had to flee the country, and shot a music video for one of the largest swahili coasts' up and coming rappers after developing a relationship with his videographer   that summer i also met a girl who coincidentally lived relatively close to me and fell in love for the first time  i was completely secure with myself for the first time in my entire life  i hold nothing but gratitude for the experience 

i unfortunately come back home when the trip is over after seriously contemplating burning my passport and running away to work on the commune (my role models and influences were free spirited authors hunter thompson and jack kerouac)  i learn the girl is extremely smart and we officially begin our relationship  my high school schedule for junior year has 6 ap classes on it (i think it was a mistake by whoever came up with it), so i go to the senior class's guidance new and unexperienced  counsellor (mine was out of town and very stubborn so i jumped at the opportunity here) and had her sign some papers that switched 5 of my classes to dual enrollment (classes at the local community college)  i'm now in high school taking a full load of college classes on top of the 2 classes i had at my high school  i have   0   friends, and i was only with my girlfriend once or twice a week due to the commute 

i get a job at a movie theatre because of the night shifts' compilability (made up word but it works) with my schedule and form some loose but fun relationships with my co workers  the biggest issue is that my bosses scheduled me for 39 hours weekly until i turn 18 and it jumped to 40, really causing my work to take up much of my ""awake time""  my schedule for the next 2 years of high school follows 

wake up at 7am and head to first period  (had a first both years)

leave high school and go to college, any time between classes i was pumping out work or studying

finish studying and eat a meal around 3 4

random things i had to get done 4 5

work 6pm to 1 2 am depending on the day

eat dinner between 1 2 30am 

sleep by 3 at the latest 

i fucking loved all of it  i loved the grind, the exhaustion, and the fact that i was doing it for myself (this is literally the first time i've given an account of my life which is why it's likely sloppy)  i just graduated last spring, but skipped the graduation ceremony because i'm still a little salty about sophomore year and didn't want to risk my family to covid  i'm still with my girlfriend, who will being going to an ivy league school next year for international relations, (she was a year younger) which she chose all because of our experience in tanzania 

my freshman and sophomore year grades were not great, and i didn't take the sat seriously because i knew i would get into the school i've always aspired to because of the associates degree i gained right before i graduated high school  while i wish i could go off with my girlfriend at the ivy, i understand i was a very different person at the time i made the grades that i did (just b's and a c in chemistry, but it's enough to knock you out of the admissions process)  i'm currently at the top state school that only 4 others in my class of 320 got into, but i feel somewhat guilty because i got in on different merits while they worked their asses off academically  i shouldn't have been in this situation to begin with because it's so unorthodox  i  hated  school until i took my college classes and easily fell in love with academia  i walked into high school half assing everything and holding the intent to piss off my institutionalized teachers and graduated with admission to a great school  nonetheless, it wouldn't have happened if i wasn't bullied some years ago

because of my love and drive for work and virtue, i should be excited about entering this new period of ""adulthood"", as it would mean i have more of a capacity to do the work that  i  want to do  i could choose items off the list and them some to do, as i would not be having schoolwork dictating my life 

but 20 is scaring me  it's just a thin symbolic line in our perception of time that ultimately means nothing between the day i turn and the day before  but it is scaring me  i understand that this could get worse with each ""big"" birthday, and don't see that as a reason to ""unjustify"" my opinion  i'm ready to do all these great things, but i'm not at all ready to be 20

1,"stoicism for a better life   weekly exercise (december 2, 2020) hello there, 

for this week s exercise, let look to marcus aurelius' wise words from his meditations iv 7 

 gt ""efface the opinion,  i am harmed , and at once the feeling of being harmed disappears  efface the feeling, and the harm disappears at once ""  

an oldie but a goodie  we're going right back into the core of stoicism with this one  all is opinion  there is no ""good"" or ""bad"" as far as externals are concerned, but thinking it makes it so  no one, no event   nothing can go inside your squishy bits you call your brain and make you think something is ""good"" or ""bad""  the decision and final judgment is ultimately up to you  it always has been and always will be 

this is why  two different people from different walks of life can look at the same thing (say a 2008 toyota corolla) and think two different things 

 gt ""what apiece of junk  i mean it works, but all my friends are driving shiny new cars  this is something a grandmother would drive  i hate it!""  
 gt   
 gt ""sweet i have a car! it works perfectly and i have heat in the winter, airconditioning in the summer and i can leave at my own schedule without waiting for the bus  i love it!""

it's all a matter of perspective and you have a choice over that perspective    so as a practical exercise this week, when you feel harmed or are upset, identify the opinion   then remove it  it really is that simple    nothing in the universe is telling you to feel upset over the issue, and there are most certainly positives in it as well  you're just not looking for them  we tend to focus only on the negatives and compare our reality to a better and non existent one  so when you are upset, just take a step back and remind yourself, you are the one making yourself upset   not the thing  and if you want freedom from this opinion, it is entirely in your power to do so 

share your stories with me, i always love hearing about them and they help inspire others

1,"my first basic duty as a human being ? when to give up on others?  

i have some people in my life which i really have had respect for  but cause of our differences in the past we are not the same anymore, i found stoicism and they just became difficult  when i talk to them, they are just really really difficult to talk to, so much that it really pisses me off sometimes in the moment, yesterday night was the same, but now looking back  it doesn't look that much of deal, and after revising my stoic wisdom, i just feel pity torwards them 

i really can't understand this person at all, sometimes i think they are playing dumb with me coz i can't believe how on the earth someone (age21) can be this difficult and stupid to talk to, but i see, i don't blame them, after examing the situation i really pity them, i feel empathic and compassion torwards their solitude, though they are acting tough 

my old mentailty tells me to just give up, but my stoic self tells me to be the bigger person, be unharmed and charge in adversity with courage , and most important my first basic duty as human is to give comfort, relief and be kind to people  but they are just plain rude to me only attacking me(only words), they say they don't need anyone else and what not, they have changed in a major way  i know trying to change someone for the better, even though they don't want our help, or even don't see their problem is major, or worse don't even see us as a friend, is literally an impossible task i e trying to control external things 

i know there is no right soultion for this thing, i can only have realtionship with my intents, but its like in the outer world, i look like a very ugly desperate person which is not helping the solution, i feel like i have wasted a lot of time and emotions on this thing which my future self won't be proud to look at past as seneca talked about once,

so what ? should i just give up coz my intents are literally very impossible like, i really am starting to worry for myself time, cause i have wasted it so much, should i care about self respect too or should carry out my duty and be strong and help people  i dont wanna break into their life, and it also feels like im spending too much of life on them

1,"discussing stoic practices the first book i wrote on stoicism, in 2009 or something, reviewed all the psychological practices i could find in the ancient stoic literature   there were about 18 distinct psychological strategies, many of which could take the form of several different specific techniques   so, in other words, there are  lots  of stoic practices   but very few of them are actually discussed in modern books and articles on the subject, for some reason   we still hear people saying over and over ""so what do stoics actually do?""  stoicism was always known as very much a practice, though, not a bookish theoretical philosophy   it's philosophy as a way of life 

so which stoic practices are most fundamental?  well, i would say there are about six that really stand out above the others   

1    the dichotomy of control  , or carefully distinguishing between your own voluntary actions and everything else, i e , the events that befall you   arrian makes this the opening sentence of epictetus'  encheiridion , the stoic handbook, for a reason   it's also the topic of the first of  the discourses    it's a foundational psychological practice of stoicism as a way of life 
2    cognitive distancing  , to borrow a term from modern psychology, or remembering that ""it's not things that upset us but rather our opinions about them"", by which the stoics mean primarily those opinions that contain strong value judgments about external (to our volition) events   this presupposes the practice above, actually, but it is also supposed to be developed into a continual ""tension"" of the mind, which the stoics called  prosoche  ( seauton ) or paying attention to yourself, specifically to the use you make of your ruling faculty ( hegemonikon ), i e , your value judgements and how those affect your feelings and desires   we can also call this ""stoic mindfulness"" therefore   this is passage 5 of  the encheiridion  
3    the view from above  , as hadot called it, by which we mean the attempt to broaden the scope of attention temporarily and spatially, in any number of ways, but typically by visualizing the world seen from above, like zeus looking down from mount olympus, or, in fact, the view from the athenian acropolis looking down upon the ancient agora, or city centre   it can also take the form of trying to imagine the whole of space and time, and our place within that context   this is an important stoic practice, as it brings together many elements of other practices, i e , it necessarily forces us to contemplate the transience of material things and our own mortality 
4    the reserve clause  , which is a technical term found in the greek stoic literature ( hupexhairesis )   we're told all actions are undertaken by stoics in accord with this principle, which acknowledges that the outcome is not directly ""up to us"" and would therefore be like adding the caveat ""fate willing"" or ""god willing"" (i e ,  deo volente  or  inshallah ) to every intention to undertake some action 
5    contemplation of death  , which is implicit in the view from above anyway but probably deserves to be considered separately   stoics are supposed to contemplate their own death every day, which seneca does, for example, by telling himself each night as he's going to sleep that he may not wake up in the morning, so he makes his peace, and views the next day as a gift or, as stoics say, ""on loan from nature"" 
6    contemplation of the sage   ( sophos ), or hypothetical perfect wise man or woman, which is a common stoic practice although, paradoxically, they were known for denying that a perfect sage had ever existed   even zeno, the founder of stoicism, is not considered to be perfect   nevertheless, the sage is the individual equivalent of the idea of a utopian ideal in society   (stoicism was founded on a utopian text called zeno's  republic , which described, ""as though in a dream"", a hypothetical community of ideal sages )   this is one of the three main sources of stoic joy that marcus aurelius describes   we must learn to take enjoyment in contemplating what is genuinely good in life, i e , wisdom and virtue   the clue is in the name  philosophy , meaning ""love of wisdom""   we are to learn to cherish and contemplate the idea of wisdom and examples of it in other people   sometimes that means looking for traces or ""seeds"" of virtue even in those who are flawed   marcus aurelius can be seen doing this in book one of  the meditations , and he even describes the rationale for the technique he's using there later in the same text 

as mentioned above, there are many other stoic techniques, some of which are also very important, but these are probably the ones that every novice stoic should be learning and practicing on a daily basis, combined with study of the ancient texts, etc "

i've read some stoicism texts, listened to discussions and podcasts on in, etc  i understand the principles  i've also studied many of the adjacent philosophies (other classical philosophies, secular buddhism, etc)  but one area that eludes me is that which i've asked in the title

1,"hope vs  anticipation vs  expectation good day everyone!

i wanted to lay grounds for open discussion about three similar terms    hope, anticipation, and expectation   

here are the definitions of our terms, taken from  lexico ( (an oup and dictionary com collaborative site) 

 gt   hope  a feeling of expectation and desire for a particular thing to happen     
 gt   
 gt   anticipation  the action of anticipating something  expectation or prediction     
 gt   
 gt   expectation  a strong belief that something will happen or be the case   

at first glance, these three terms sound identical, with varying degrees of  expectation  as well as different modes (action as opposed to belief as opposed to a feeling)  however, i was not satisfied with a singular point of view, and instead dug up other definitions from different perspectives 

  anticipation vs  expectation

  however, there is a clear connotative distinction between the two     anticipation is looking forward with excitement to what is coming   , resting in the assurance that it will be good regardless of what form it takes     expectation is projecting an imagined reality onto the future     ( source (
  what s the difference between anticipation and expectation?     the difference is in our attitude  one is hope and one is entitlement     hope allows for any number of things to happen  hope keeps us open to possibilities we couldn t even imagine  entitlement usually has a very specific outcome  it relies on other people to react and behave in the way we want them to  ( source (     they chucked in  hope  in this example, so please roll with it

  expectation vs  hope

  while    expectation is the assumption that something is actually going to happen   , false or not,    hope is the wish for something to happen     hope is flexible  ( source (
  having    hope means you are trusting the process     having an    expectation means you are trusting the results     having a    hope means that the future is uncertain     having an    expectation means that you are predetermining the future     having a hope is an action of humility  having an expectation can be an act of pride  having a hope does not disappoint     having an expectation often falls short     ( source (

  hope vs  anticipation

    as nouns the difference between hope and anticipation   is that   hope   is (uncountable) the belief or expectation that something wished for can or will happen    while   anticipation   is the act of anticipating, taking up, placing, or considering something beforehand, or before the proper time in natural order  ( source (

the above is by no means an exhaustive list, as i could have easily lost myself in differing opinions of  what is what  and  why it is such   however, i did my best finding results that compared each term to each other (a lot of the results for hope  amp  anticipation were regarded as partner terms, especially within religion, and hardly defined either of them individually) 

after reading through these, the three terms' definitions become more muddled  as such, questions can arise such as 

  are hope and anticipation just sub branches of the umbrella term expectation?
  is hope a milder version of expectation and anticipation its fail safe?
  could one be all right in anticipating an outcome, yet have no expectations?
  can one give up their expectations so as to not be affected by the result, but still hope for it? etc , etc 

let's say for example, you were driving on the freeway highway what have you  with the knowledge that there are bad drivers, would you anticipate them or expect them? would one expecting bad drivers on the road anticipate them? or because you are anticipating bad drivers, would you expect to see one zoom past you? would you hope not to run into any?

so how does this tie in with stoicism? many on this subreddit will know, passion is something all stoics try to diminish or even eradicate from their lives  as a refresher, passion is defined as thus, taken from the  faq (

 gt passions (      pathological emotions) are emotions caused or reinforced by a belief that something not up to us is either good or bad  they are symptoms of mistaken beliefs about good and bad 

  
and here are some quotes from ancient stoics about expectation 

 gt  the result is, consequently, that    when a man finds that some of his plans have turned out contrary to his expectations, he becomes impatient with men and things   , and on the slightest provocation becomes angry now with a person, now with his calling, now with his place of abode, now with his luck, now with himself     seneca, ( essays,  on anger, iii  vi  4 vii  2)

 amp  x200b 

 gt     seek not that the things that happen should happen as you wish     but wish the things which happen to be as they are, and you will have a tranquil flow of life     epictetus ( enchiridion , section 8)

 amp  x200b 

 gt           if you can embrace this without fear or expectation    can find fulfillment in what you re doing now, as nature intended, and in superhuman truthfulness (every word, every utterance) then your life will be happy  no one can prevent that     marcus aurelius ( meditations,  book 3, chapter 12   gregory hays translation  )

 amp  x200b 

 gt  when you show a cake to greedy persons, and swallow it all yourself,    do you expect them    not to snatch it from you?    epictetus ( discourses , book 1, chapter 18   george long translation  )

from casual observation, a lot of negative emotions and by extension, passions stem from a thwarted expectation of a certain outcome to a situation  would a person's reaction to the aftermath be different if he or she were to instead hope or anticipate? or would the approach not matter?

notwithstanding their perception of their emotions afterwards, could a stoic successfully bypass this process by changing whether to hope, anticipate, or expect? or none at all?

  this is not so much a question seeking a single answer as it is picking your brains and your take on hope vs  anticipation vs  expectation  i look forward to or dare i say anticipate everyone's thoughts   "

allow me to explain my situation as briefly as possible   i'm a 15 year old and was introduced to stoicism last year  however no one i know practices it or knows about it, which is fine  i have noticed some differences that trying to apply stoic framework to my thinking have created between my reaction internally and externally to any situation as compared to my peers  most recently example, my best friend (whom i love dearly and is like a brother to me) got diagnosed with covid  i was definitely surprised when i found out but i didn't panic immediately cuz me panicking doesn't make a difference, it's stupid right? but in my head i kept thinking if i should be panicking? like i am 'supposed' to react to things in a certain way but when i don't, internally i feel like maybe something is wrong with me but i know there isn't but i just can't ever be sure!!

1,5 realistic stoic quotes on control 
1,"understanding epictetus' athlete story quote from epictetus' discourses, book 1, chapter 2 

 gt a certain athlete, at risk of dying unless his genitals were amputated, made a comparable choice  his brother, a philosopher, went and asked him, 'well, my brother, what's it going to be? will you have them amputated, and return to life in the gymnasium?' the man refused to submit to the indignity, however, and summoned the will to die   
  
 gt   
 gt someone asked, 'did he choose death as an athlete or as a philosopher?' 'as a man,' epictetus said, 'one who had competed at the level of the olympic games, where he was a familiar figure, and a victor more than once   no occasional visitor to the local gym  someone else might have even allowed his head to be removed, if his life could have been saved thereby  that's what i mean by having considerations for one's character  and it shows how weighty a factor it can be when it is allowed a regular role in one's deliberations 

firstly, if the athlete could have nevertheless continued with his career (as per his brother proposal to return to the gymnasium), where is the drama here? the only explanation i found is in  this article ( which claims that 

 gt the   dignity   loss is greater, because it was believed that eunuchs could not perform well in the games due to side effects linked to their loss of genitals

secondly, i don't really get is why epictetus makes this sound like ""losing one's genitals is an indignity only for athletes""  i mean, wouldn't  any  man go trough similar pangs when confronted with this situation?"
1,"regret is such a wonderful object for stoic humor was just discussing a past choice of mine in another sub, thought some of the conclusions we came to could make a good exercise 

about 5 years ago, i worked with a guy who was a competitive bodybuilder   quite popular in the local scene and even trained with a few pros  i've always been into it as well, but at a very hobbyist level  

one day at lunch we were talking about training and he mentioned that he thought i'd do well if i competed in physique (a division of bodybuilding that's geared towards a ""male model on the beach"" look, rather than the extremely muscular look found in open bodybuilding ) my reaction was just to say i wasn't cut out for it, wouldn't do well anyway, etc etc 

thought back on the exchange earlier, and how i'd probably be further along in bodybuilding if i had instead answered ""never thought about it, can you help me get started?"" well, i didn't and i'm not  

here's where i think we can get stoic about it  isn't it silly that i looked my friend   who by every measure knew far more about the subject than i   dead in the eye and essentially said "" you're wrong, i would know because i fuckin suck "" the combination of self loathing and wilful ignorance is absurd on its face! let's consider that a lesson learned, and laugh at my nonsensical response rather than dread it "

it is not a small choice to make  my hesitation stems mainly from the freedoms you give up in the military as opposed to the jobs themselves  if i don't land a pilot slot its 4 years commitment, if i do, it is 10 years  the hope is that i love the job either way, but of course i can't be sure 

stoicism has helped me in getting to where i am now  it has proved valuable to me thus far  but i'm not sure how the philosophy applies to huge decisions and uncertainties like this? anyone know?"

1,i bought 2 books about diogenes and seneca  any other recommendations i m looking to read more besides mediations  also what books should i read by epictetus 
1,"human life (meditations book 2 xvii) duration  momentary  nature  changeable  perception  dim  condition of body  decaying  soul  spinning around  fortune  unpredictable  lasting fame  uncertain  sum up  the body and its parts are a river, the soul a dream and mist, life is warfare and a journey far from home, lasting reputation is oblivion  then what can guide us? only philosophy  which means making sure that the power within stays safe and free from assault, superior to pleasure and pain, doing nothing randomly or dishonestly and with imposture, not dependent on anyone else s doing something or not doing it  and making sure that it accepts what happens and what it is dealt as coming from the same place it came from  and above all, that it accepts death in a cheerful spirit, as nothing but the dissolution of the elements from which each living thing is composed  if it doesn t hurt the individual elements to change continually into one another, why are people afraid of all of them changing and separating? it s a natural thing  and nothing natural is evil "
1,"understanding epictetus' burning down of the capitol excerpt from epictetus' discourses, book i, chapter 8 (emphasis mine) 

 gt  you know, i once said the same thing to musonius when he reproached me for not discovering the omission in a certain syllogism    i said, 'it's not like i burned down the capitol ' and he said, 'idiot, the omission here is the capitol '  
 gt 
 gt  i mean, are these the only crimes, killing your father and burning down the capitol? but to use one's impressions recklessly, carelessly and at random, to fail to analyse an argument as either valid proof or fallacy, and, in a word, to  fail to see in the act of question and answer what agrees with your position and what conflicts   is nothing wrong in all of that?

i suppose that capitol is a name of a building on  the capitoline hill  1  in ancient rome, but i nonetheless struggle to understand epictetus' message here 

is it 

 1  a simile? not observing that a premise is missing from a syllogism is as grave as burning down a city?
 2  a literal correlation? that omission from the syllogism was about the capitol?
 3  if something else, what?

now i have a question because i dont fully understand the concept behind it 

would a stoic wise man help another person in danger? 

i mean, because of the ""divine providence"" (hope i used the right word in english) you would not really care  am i right? whatever happens, is because ""god"" made it that way  so why even try?"

here s the thing though, even when you start over, you never really go back to square one  it s not a failure, it s not a loss  if anything, it s taking the wisdom you gained  amp  knowing what shortcomings and mistakes to leave behind   

this leads to something that took a long time for myself to realize  your past isn t all bad  it, for better  amp  worse, brought about this change in your life  as such, there s some good in that! for me, it was learning to appreciate silence  amp  stillness, the importance of taking full use of the present moment, and learning to forgive others  amp  myself  

if you haven t already, i highly recommend reading  thelonestoic s post ( on making a fresh start  we all have control to change some things in our lives  don t wait to change them  i wish you all the best  amp  leave with this quote from seneca   


 putting things off is the biggest waste of life  it snatches away each day as it comes, and denies us the present by promising the future  the greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today  you are arranging what lies in fortune s control, and abandoning what lies in yours  what are you looking at? to what goal are you straining? the whole future lies in uncertainty  live immediately

1,"stoic way to deal with a childish roommate trying to harass me everyday  hi everyone  this is my very first post here  english is my 2nd language so please forgive me for any grammar logical mistake 

one month ago, i (f26) made a mistake to my roommate (24f) and since then she has been harassing me everyday as a revenge for that mistake  we are living in the same room  one night at 4am i left the bedroom door opened and the bathroom door opened while i was brushing my teeth  that made her woke up and immediately she slammed the bedroom door so hard that i think there's someone falling down the stair  i know that's my bad because i cannot go to sleep before 12pm  i've tried and it took me 2   3 hours to fall to sleep on my bed  the day after, she warn me that she would tell the landlord about my behaviour  and even though i apologized to her and moved all of my bottles for personal hygiene to the living room, to not make any noise when i go to sleep, she keeps taking a revenge on me by  (1) ignores my presence in the house, (2) always slams the door when get in and out the bedroom, slams every cubboard door when she saw me (3), try to making noise with her slippers at the morning as she wakes up before me 

the last straw was that last week, i get out of the bedroom after closing the door and didn't recognize the door was opened again (the door handle is ruined by being slammed too many times i think)  i was still standing outside in front of the bedroom while she slammed the door so hard that i had a heart attack right behind my back  from that day i decided to move 90  of my belongings out of the bedroom to the living room  i couldn't have only one peaceful day staying in that bedroom 

plus, we used to clean the house twice each week  and now i've always been the person who clean the house first in the week, and i saw her barely clean the house properly (next to doing nothing) after me  i planned to move out of this house in 1 month  but it still seems unbearable encountering her in this house 

now, as i'm studying 8 12 hours  day to finish my online courses, i don't want to waste my time arguing with her  i'm new to living in a shared house (less than 2 years), and so is she (less than 1 year)  this situation (she taking a revenge on me) has not been happened once but 3 times, and i've been always the person who say sorry (even it's not my fault when i want to open the window (her side in the room) and she ignored me for 2 weeks) and break the ice to maintain the relationship 

tl'dr  my roommate has been taking a revenge on me in one month  how to stay calm and focus on my study?"

1,"leisure without study is death, a tomb for the living person  seneca when i read this or some of the other things from the stoics it always makes me wonder what they were like in everyday life    would they have been no fun to be around because they were never able to stop studying or working?   if they were around now would they stop to go to the park to play or pull out the playstation and play some cod with their kids?   would any of them belong to a softball team or bowling league?

1,"what do you think? do you think that socrates choice to die rather than escape was stoic? i have often imagined myself in socrates' shoes  will i also make socrates' decision to die rather than escape?

i have read about socrates death and the circumstances surrounding it a couple of times but lately, i have been listening to the performance for about the third or fourth time in an audio book version  this version even further gives a clearer picture of the events that led to his decision to die  

one of the soundest reasons socrates gave for his decision was that he was right for the sake of obliging to the law 

but my concern is,  isn't it possible for the law to seem to support some vice? and in this case also, shall we oblige?

or for example, if the law forbade socrates to speak and live like he did, would he have also obliged?

these are some of my concerns, i'd appreciate any opinions "

1,"wheaton college lecture of stoic philosophy   focus on metaphysics from a christian pov some features of the lecture include the stoic conception of the soul and the order of the universe, cleanthes' hymn to zeus, paul addressing the athenians (both epicureans and stoics), christian responses to the stoic logos and what they liked and disliked about it  

since it is a lecture addressed to a christian audience it focuses on the more subtle and obscure aspects of stoicism that most people ignore nowadays that appeal to people interested in theology  so it's a good lecture to watch if you're interested in digging a little deeper than the popular quotes often repeated  it's a philosophy after all, interested in all aspects of human knowledge, not just journals or therapies, as good as they can be  it may not be a religion by the popular dictionary definition of religion, but it certainly influenced religion in the west

one key takeaway i got from it is to decouple my mind from pain and pleasure, these things aren't inherently good or bad but i shouldn't allow my mind soul to be corrupted afflicted by them and instead focus on directing my thoughts, words and actions to the ""common good"" 

but what exactly is this common good  lessening people's sufferings? allowing people to experience more happiness? if we de value pain and pleasure for ourselves, would it not be a contradiction to pursue the common good through these things? 

are we supposed to only apply these ideology inwards while helping others achieve these same things we condemn?"

you can t just apply   stoic philosophy   to your life in ordre to feel better just like you would take a painkiller to make the pain stops  stoic philosophy is not a short term option

1,"how would a stoic deal with sociopathy psychopathy? unfortunately, it is quite common for people to run into sociopathic or psychopathic individuals even when you are not aware of it  in the real world i believe that business leaders, managers, executives are commonly psychopathic or sociopathic and many of us have to deal with them on a regular basis either directly or indirectly in our jobs or even our living situations with landlords rental managers 

here are some sources for my assumption 

 

 

 

i myself am a business owner and i am almost positive i deal with sociopathy and psychopathy on a pretty regular basis with other managers business owners  i am sure employees have at least one psychopath or sociopath on their establishment's management team  i am sure your landlord or rental manager(s) have at least at one point been socio or psychopathic to some degree 

i myself am also humbly new to reading about and trying to exercise stoicism, so i am reaching out to this community seeking those more learned than i on the matter  how would a stoic deal with sociopathy and psychopathy in their own lives? are perhaps stoic ideals not effective when it comes to dealing with them as sociopathy and psychopathy i would argue are not in accordance with nature virtue reason good "

1,"has anyone thought to radically apply the practice of stoicism? pardon the rambling  i feel a compulsion to turn aside from the world's expectations and return to the roots of my humanity  i feel like walking a path of hundreds if not thousands of miles  bringing my struggles with minimalism into focus, head on and radically developing my sense of appreciation for what i have left behind on my journey 

i don't know if anyone else has found themselves in struggles to break socially cultivated addictive behaviors prevalent in today, but i have  i find myself in good health with unique circumstances and facing a calling to walk into my natural environment and seek a territory that holds psychedelics in more legal esteem 

i recognize that this compulsion matches up with much of the stoic philosophy  self deprivation, testing what you can control vs cannot, gaining mastery over the mind and immunity to the influences of contemporary society  etc  a brief and challenging separation from the heart of consumer society may do more to advance a stoic practice than anything  

has anyone else considered such a thing?

1,"how does a stoic perform self control and achieve virtue through it? hi, first of all   


i often find myself struggling a lot with personal desires and often avoid work for school and important duties due to it  this mostly happens with things such as watching youttube videos or similar 'activities'   
i do think that many find themselves in a position of thinking 'i'll watch just one more video and then work' and then never actually following up on it, at least i've heard so from friends   
ever since i discovered stoicism i've become uncomfortably aware of this lack of control over my 'desires'  currently, i'm reading seneca (which is a wonderful book, by the way, i find it to be a lot easier than meditations) and it has finally given me the last 'nudge' so to speak, but i still can't get a hold of myself  i've read the quote (which i only have in german and thus don't know how to quote it here 'xd) about lust being only temporary and virtue forever countless times and i'm in awe at the idea behind it, but still can't find the motivation to carry out these ideas in my day to day life    
i found that this 'addiction' to social media, youtube, etc  is probably the single most disruptive part of my life and since this is something fully in my control i really wish to change myself for the better   
being a member of this amazing community for a few months now and being inspired by it constantly i thought that i might find a bit of help here  )

ralph waldo emerson said this   make your own bible  select and collect all the words and sentences that in all your readings have been to you like the blast of a trumpet   this has reverberated in the caverns of my soul  i highly recommend doing so 

honestly, i don't think anything makes me more giddy than a really simple and  good  sentence  some examples down below  definitely get the book, it has more than 600 really great ones 


   we are never as unhappy as we think, or as happy as we had hoped  

   we are never as fortunate or unfortunate as we imagine  

   how can we predict what we shall want in the future, since we do not know exactly what we want at the moment? 

   you cannot answer for your courage when you have never been in danger  

   the inertia of laziness casts a secret spell over the soul, which suddenly halts our most zealous pursuits and our most stubbornly held resolutions  finally, to give a true idea of this passion, it must be said that laziness is like a blissful state of the soul, which comforts it for all its losses, and which acts as a substitute for all good things  

   when you cannot find peace within yourself, it is useless to look for it elsewhere  

   we more readily set limits to our gratitude than to our hopes and desires  

   when we have the strength to admit our faults, that in itself should be some compensation for them  

   we should not be offended that other people hide the truth from us, since we so often hide it from ourselves  

   we readily criticize other people s faults, but we rarely use them to correct our own  

   a true friend is the greatest of all possessions, and the one that we give least thought to acquiring  

   we are more able than willing  often we imagine that things are impossible because we want to excuse ourselves in our own eyes  

   however brilliant a deed may be, it should never be taken for a great one unless it results from great plans  

   our minds are better employed bearing the misfortunes that do happen to us than anticipating those that could happen  

   often what prevents us from giving ourselves up to a particular vice is the fact that we have a number of them  

   we forget our faults easily when they are known only to ourselves  

   there are people of whom we would never believe evil unless we saw it  but there are none in whom we should be surprised to see it  

   someone who thinks he can find enough in himself to do without everyone else is greatly deceived  but someone who thinks that other people cannot do without him is still more deceived  

   gratitude is like good faith in business  it keeps commerce going  we do not pay up because it is right for us to discharge our debt, but so that we can more easily find people who will lend to us  

   few things are impossible in themselves  we lack the diligence to make them succeed, rather than the means  

   men s virtues have their season, as fruits do  

   sometimes in life there are events that you need to be a little foolish to handle  

   if there are men whose absurd side has never been revealed, it is because no one has looked for it properly  

   our wisdom is no less at the mercy of fortune than our possessions are  

   circumstances reveal our nature to other people, and still more to ourselves  

   we ought to treat fortune like health  enjoy it when it is good, be patient when it is bad, and never use drastic remedies except in a case of absolute necessity  

   nearly all of our faults are more forgivable than the means we use to hide them  

   we often think we are being constant in a time of misfortune when we are merely downcast and endure it without daring to face it, like cowards who let themselves be killed because they are afraid to defend themselves  "
1," love now  breathe now   that line is from the song screenshot by swans  i am putting it here because it struck me as very stoic and i had a realization that i thought i would share  but to preface, i highly recommend this song but it s not for everyone  swans is a very intense band  

in the song that quote is yelled near the end during the climax as a sort of mantra  the music sonically gets very, very intense and  epic  if you will  very heavy instruments and it speeds into a whirlwind of chaos  but it s so juxtaposed with that lyric,  love now  breathe now   

that s when i had a realization today, after listening to that song countless times  in life, it is vital to respond to situations in our life properly  we already know this  it can be hard  however while it is important to do this every day, it is especially important to do this when chaos is thrown our way  

in my interpretation, to  love now     is an outward projection to those around us  and to     breath now  is an inward response to those situations and chaos  so no matter what happens, whatever situation you are in  whatever chaos is thrown your way, love now  breathe now "

1,"how could i apply stoicism to this situation? currently do to covid, i work from home  my work involves repairing electronics and i use a work bench and soldering equipment and various odds and ends  i live with 5 others in a pretty large space and rent a room  i asked about moving my work bench into a corner in the living room that nobody uses for my repairs   which consist about 2 hours of my work a day and the rest are various other tasks like prep, customer service, research, and shipping that i would still do inside of my room as those do not require my tools or a separate work bench as the repairs do  i was met with gracious approval from 4 out of the 5 roommates, the fifth roommate who is also the lease holder and manages renting out all of the rooms was much more on the fence about it  he has been blowing me off about it with no concise answer to my ask and told me he wants to ask all the roommates about it when i already have citing that ""they're all agreeable people but might not actually want you to "" he also brought up the possibility of extra rent for a 15 sq ft space in the living room which i can kind of understand, however i also do find it offensive because i also have the worst room in the house and i pay the same rent as the other same sized ones and  200 mo less than for the one double the size of mine  

this roommate has also blown me off for other issues in the past  we live in a multi family home with a mom and teen underneath us  this teen was blasting music late at night and screaming at video games when i first moved in which i dealt with at first, and then i began to knock on their door constantly and asked this roommate if he can do anything about it but he kept putting it off  it wasn't until i called the police a few times that they finally stopped, but this roommate also threatened to kick me out if i called the police again 

as i'm writing this it's becoming a bit apparent to myself that moving out may the best option   but where i live is still a good deal for what i'm getting all things considered now that the noise issue was resolved  

i'm wrote this situation down myself to try and determine what i'm more irritated by   the disapproval of my ask, or the way this roommate is handling my humble ask 

i came to the conclusion that i find his answer to be very self righteous and offensive to myself and the other roommates (adults who are 25 and over) and it is pretty offensive to make value judgements on all of them by saying they're too ""agreeable"" to tell me no  it is not a big deal to me if i can't move my work bench out in the living room  i can carry on being cramped in my room and working that way or find another way to better utilize the space in my room or move to my own bigger space  

obviously now i want to tell this roommate my perspective on what i perceive as his unnecessary handling of my simple ask  but would a stoic do that? what would marcus aurelius do? would he just stick to the facts when engaging?"

background is, i've been having a lot of anxiety that i've realized has to do with the fact that i don't trust believe in myself that i am making the right decisions  logically i know there is no reason for me to be anxious  i know logically that i am making the right decisions based on the information that i have available and that i spend too much time looking ahead rather than being in the present moment  i tend to not be in the present moment and so i get caught up in thinking about the ""logistics of the future"", not even daydreaming about possibilities, but just mapping out in my mind all the little things that i need to do to achieve something  for example, thinking about moving to a new apartment, i'll be up at night not being able to sleep because i'm thinking about where each furniture item will go and which new items i need to purchase to outfit my apartment  

i want to be able to get away from this thinking because it's taking up so much mind space and not allowing me to be in the present and be grateful for what i do have, and to be able to trust myself and appreciate how far i've come  any tips? thanks!!!"

aside from all of that, i have been a stay at home mom for 6 years  we d agreed on that until the kids went to school  so, i don t have much and i m literally rebuilding from the bottom now  which is okay, but he s making things worse  we re now going to court and things have gotten nasty  we can t seem to agree  in some ways i feel like he s trying to hurt punish me and i m not really sure why

i chose the wrong (study) path for myself!

i chose the wrong field of study and i went to college for that  it was my 2nd option (and still science related) and i thought i liked it before college, but after a year in, i realized i did not like it, and it wasn't what i thought it would be  and it did not have the future and work environment that i wanted 

i wanted to quit and retry many times, but my family told me not to do that, as it is was a good major, and i accepted 

all those years was like hell for me and i tried to let go of that hate  i finally graduated and the regret and guilt came back again  i still can't stop blaming myself for that and i still have nightmares about that 

i wish i had tried more to get into my first option  i didn't care about it much back then, but now i do  it suits my personality and my expectations  i keep thinking about past alternatives in which i made right choices and it just makes me feel worse, knowing i can't get back it time to fix it and to convince myself to make the right choice 

i can't retry and get into my favorite (and more suitable) field  i mean, i'm in my mid 20s and i have to be in a class with students much younger than me, which would be weird (to me)!

1,"help me overcome my young sister's suicide 4 months ago my young sister killed herself  our family dynamics, placed me in a position of a proud, and influencing older brother  i put a lot of effort in to giving my time to provide fortuity to my young siblings 

since her death, i have been plagued with realisation, and fear, of death  i instantaneously feel life is so short  

i have followed this sub for a long while, and as a rationalist, i seek to take life one step at a time, and overcome many things, to accept what i can, and cannot do in my short existence  

however, now, on a daily basis, i fear death  i fear i am rapidly aging (31), and i am past my peak, and i keep trying to convince myself to stop thinking about the totality of life and that i will indeed, one day, die  it feels rather close (meaning old age)  i feel like i wont have enough time for everything   a family, career etc  

i think i can accept her death, but i am struggling to come to terms with my position in life  we grow up with a grandiosity of what we will achieve  my mind flashes back to such happy times when i was a kid, but with so many close deaths in my small family, and the dissolution of my family wellbeing, i know that contented dream is kinda faded  

do you guys fear death? how do you overcome your knowledge of your guaranteed death? how can we feel content knowing our time is limited? age old questions, but only questions which have become ultra real as a result of my circumstance  my world perspective has been truly rocked  how can i wake, and go to sleep, without feeling my death is too imminent?

i m not afraid of death  what i am afraid of is the intense physical pain that would come in the process of a slow and gruesome death 

i guess a more mild example would be having my leg cut off  i m not afraid of no longer having my leg  i know i would have no choice other than to accept that my leg is gone and that i would have to adapt and adjust my life accordingly  but what i am afraid of is the physical pain that would come during the act process of my leg being cut off

1,"vanity  amp  social media make me believe that stoicism is more relative and helpful today than it ever was in the past  what do you think? just began my journey with learning more about and exercising stoic philosophy last week  i'm in the middle of reading  how to think like a roman emperor  by donald robertson and the more i'm learning the more apparent to me the issues with social media are  not that they weren't apparent before or aren't to anyone else, it just feels like with learning stoicism there's a constant reminder floating in front of my face  

i scroll through instagram and all i see now are people seeking validation and what i would call being vain  stoicism teaches that vanity prevents yourself from looking at yourself objectively and recognizing your own faults to improve or change them  i of course engaged in this as well at various points in my life, but now i can definitely see both within myself and in others that it certainly did prevent myself from recognizing my own faults and changing them  instagram or facebook or even reddit gives you a false sense of validation that is often unearned or without merit  even youtube videos of stoicism itself, i'm sure the vast majority of people watch on 5 minutes stoicism video and then feel like they know everything about the philosophy when marcus aurelius constantly studied and exercised the philosophy nearly his whole life  i suppose a true learner of stoicism would have a real advantage compared to the majority people in this regard if you look at it this way  

i also could be wrong to be looking at what others are doing on there and judging according to stoicism (not completely sure on that since i am still a stoicism noob)

 gt treat it as a puzzle  you know that some accepted ideas will later turn out to be wrong  see if you can guess which  the end goal is not to find flaws in the things you're told, but to find the new ideas that had been concealed by the broken ones  so this game should be an exciting quest for novelty, not a boring protocol for intellectual hygiene  and you'll be surprised, when you start asking ""is this true?"", how often the answer is not an immediate yes  if you have any imagination, you're more likely to have too many leads to follow than too few 

 gt   more generally your goal should be not to let anything into your head unexamined, and things don't always enter your head in the form of statements  some of the most powerful influences are implicit    how do you even notice these? by standing back and watching how other people get their ideas 

 gt when you stand back at a sufficient distance, you can see ideas spreading through groups of people like waves  the most obvious are in fashion  you notice a few people wearing a certain kind of shirt, and then more and more, until half the people around you are wearing the same shirt  you may not care much what you wear, but there are intellectual fashions too   

 gt      

 gt it seems to me that it has three components  fastidiousness about truth, resistance to being told what to think, and curiosity 

 gt   fastidiousness about truth means more than just not believing things that are false  it means being careful about degree of belief    for most people, degree of belief rushes unexamined toward the extremes  the unlikely becomes impossible, and the probable becomes certain  to the independent minded, this seems unpardonably sloppy    

 gt the independent minded thus have a horror of ideologies, which require one to accept a whole collection of beliefs at once, and to treat them as articles of faith  to an independent minded person that would seem revolting, just as it would seem to someone fastidious about food to take a bite of a submarine sandwich filled with a large variety of ingredients of indeterminate age and provenance 

 gt      

 gt the second component of independent mindedness, resistance to being told what to think, is the most visible of the three  but even this is often misunderstood  the big mistake people make about it is to think of it as a merely negative quality  the language we use reinforces that idea  you're unconventional  you don't care what other people think  but it's not just a kind of immunity  in the most independent minded people, the desire not to be told what to think is a positive force  it's not mere skepticism, but an active delight in ideas that subvert the conventional wisdom, the more counterintuitive the better 

 gt      

 gt the third component of independent mindedness, curiosity, may be the most interesting   

 gt in my experience, independent mindedness and curiosity predict one another perfectly  everyone i know who's independent minded is deeply curious, and everyone i know who's conventional minded isn't   

 gt   the three components of independent mindedness work in concert  fastidiousness about truth and resistance to being told what to think leave space in your brain, and curiosity finds new ideas to fill it   



this really jives with my understanding of how we examine appearances, which is a critical and essentially non stop task  it's nice to see it as ""an exciting quest for novelty, not a boring protocol for intellectual hygiene"" "
1,"is controlling the times when you let yourself loose a good idea? we all must be angry and mad at something or someone,but is it a good idea to do it knowingly at times where it is silent and cant hurt us  i find myself to want to be angry at someone and rage even tho i dont agree with those thoughts  have you guys ever done this, what do you think about this way of letting yourself off?"
1,"always treat others with respect  reflecting on my day brought me to the thought process of when dealing with any person, no matter how they are behaving, you should always treat them with respect  sometimes people are difficult and rude and it is easy to react in a defensive or aggressive way  though we should treat each interaction precisely and calmly  i do not mean to be a pushover and let people walk on you but rather deal with things with dignity and understanding, because otherwise you are compromising your own virtue  lead by example, treat others well and they are inclined to treat you that way  also this shows true maturity and integrity   )"

i am physically crippled, i cannot work, i can barely walk, but for some reason i feel that i must shoulder the worlds burdens and have a want to reshape the world for the better, both of which i know are impossible for me 

i avoid websites like twitter, facebook and tumblr which have toxic communities, but i still end up looking for contraversy that makes me dislike a person, or seeing people act entitled which makes me judge them, i wish to live internally, to live for myself, i myself need selfcare, but i am not providing it, i don't want to care about what others think, especially when i know they cannot realistically affect me "

1,"i turned 23 today and made sure as few people knew as possible for context, i'm 23 years old today and viscerally, birthdays meant a whole deal to me, which is why as a challenge to myself, i've removed my birthday from all social media, including linked in, as a kid, i remember i always felt disappointed about how my birthday went, didn't feel "" special enough"" had cringey facebook posts when i was 12ish saying things like "" tomorrow is my birthday"" lmao  

years of disappointment when it came to my birthday i came to realise that the problem wasn't the situation, but my perception of the situation, that is not to say that people didn't disappoint me, with my ex on her birthday, i made sure i conveyed how important that day was for me, with gifts, time spent, my words to her etc, and she couldn't even do 1 4th of all of that for me, and i don't blame her coz she isn't the affectionate and expressive type, she couldn't even do that for her mom  plus they say exes are exes for a reason right? ( i made it sounds like i broke up with her but that wasn't the case  p, though in hindsight i'm glad she did)

i'm the funny guy, the clown of any group im part of and been told that i should try standup comedy, but hardly anyone knows that this humour has developed as a defense mechanism from always having an innate sadness, maybe it's been a generic predisposition  i objectively have everything, a family i love more than life itself and a couple of close friends, but i'm still not passing the vibe check but i'm working towards it

i used to look at people celebrating their friends birthdays with loads of stories on instagram and i was always jealous, i wanted the whole shebang too, so this year i completely toppled my own expectations and so far i've cut a cake with my family got wishes from them, got a wish from one friend, another knows since he's been pointing it out for a week but hasn't wished maybe because i said i just want peace and quite and will be chilling at home on my birthday to him  

now it looks like this has nothing to do with stoicism but stoicism is my major reason for doing this, it is to show myself that at the end of the day i only need myself, i have to be a better friend to myself, and as seneca said   "" expectations are the greatest impediment to living"" i have curbed my expectations of being celebrated on my birthday, snapchat has harassed me everyday to put a birthday icon on my bitmoji or something but i didn't give in  i'm weirdly proud of myself

1,"my experience with stoic principles i had a test today in which i could have gotten full marks but because of my stupidity it did not go very well  
what followed was dismay, panic, anxiety and headache  i was tempted to turn to porn to distract myself 

but all through this, i kept telling myself that the test is over and the result is not in my control so i shouldnt fret over it and i wouldn't have reacted this way if some other person told me that their test went bad and turning to porn is non virtuous  
initially, it did not work and i got more and more depressed but i kept on going and then calmed down

1,"a non judgemental stoic perspective i'll jump straight to the point  i am deeply concerned about the change taking place in my country, britain  not only are we building extensively on green areas, our communities are transforming and, as far as i can see, this isn't exactly having a great effect on cohesion    


i live in what was a pretty small market town in the midlands and over the past few years houses are shooting up everywhere and countryside is being built upon  the face of my town is changing fairly quickly, taking its sense of community with it  when i look at what has now taken place in both large and also smaller cities, i fear that this will only get worse here    


now, marcus spoke about accepting change and how change is  natures delight   he also wrote about the foolishness of trying to resist change, but like most things in the modern world, this is far from natural  i try to block it out, i try to go further within myself and appreciate what i have  i try to remind myself that most individuals are good and that this is all completely out of my control, but it's something that is really draining my emotional wellbeing  i try to fight it but thinking about my town in 5, 10 or 15 years really drives my mood down   especially given that i have a two year old and, like any parent, i worry about what she may face    


when i take my walks i find myself being disturbed as i watch these housing developments spring up all over the place, taking green and pleasant land with them    


so, anyway, i'd like your thoughts on this  i suppose we all have our weaknesses and this is one of mine  how would you approach this and avoid despair in my situation?"

1,"when are things good? things are good when you can face life confidently, knowing that you can take on any challenge that destiny throws at you 

things are good when you focus on the present  you live today and do your best work here and now 

things are good when you deeply accept and love your current position in life  you re happy about the person you are today, the people around you, and everything else in your life    good  or  bad  

things are good when you are not doing anything immoral  you re not screwing people over to get a personal benefit  you re a social being and focused on committing social acts that benefit other people 

things are good when you don t let your future ambitions distort your present  focus on doing your best work now and leave the rest to the universe to work out 

the only real benefit in life is to be a good man  to enjoy every moment you ve been given, commit good acts, and fulfill your role in this universe without blinking an eye in the face of adversity if it should arise

it has been a somewhat tough year   first my grandpa was diagnosed with a relatively mild prostate cancer, followed by a rare and serious cancer on my grandma just two months later  you know how it goes, sometimes nothing happens and sometimes everything at once  obviously covid is making everything more difficult 

my grandpa, someone i look up to and consider very wise (i dare say he comes closest to being a natural stoic) faced his diagnosis with strength and perseverance, but the second, larger blow that is my grandma's diagnosis hit him really hard  i see the sadness in his eyes as he slowly comes to terms with the inevitable  his spirit is not what it was, and it hurts seeing him quietly suffering in his sorrows 

i know we've been extremely lucky to enjoy the company of my elders well into their 80s  stoicism has helped me a lot this year and i do feel prepared for whatever we may face  however i do not know how to communicate my courage and perseverance to my grandparents, especially grandpa (my grandma does not understand well enough the serious nature of the diagnosis, and as of now still has high spirits)  how do you give courage to a man who knows his and his loved one's end is near? how do you help him find peace and comfort?

i keep telling myself that how i feel shouldnt affect my duties and that i should keep going but it is very difficult  is this just me or has anyone else experienced this too?

how do i cope with this? people have coped woth worse things without wanting to look to other people for comfort  

what should i do?"
1,"inner citadel brief book review the inner citadel is an interesting book that deeply analyzes marcus aurelius and stoic philosophy    pierre hadot displays a great deal of knowledge about stoicism and marcus's life that is much more than you will ever find by just reading the meditations or any other primary stoic source   he systematically breaks down stoicism, and shows how the meditations is actually a grouping of certain key virtues, rather than random sayings   

what i found most interesting was hadot's analysis of the key virtues and disciplines, and i specifically took note of the exercises that stoic's like marcus used to achieve these disciplines, such as the reserve clause 

i definitely would not recommend this book to anyone new to stoicism, since it is quite dense and can easily put you off on such a great philosophy if this is your first exposure to it   you're better off reading meditations 

i would recommend this to anyone who is interested in knowing more about stoic philosophy from a historical point of view, and anyone who wants an overall better understand of stoicism   

although, i think this is an interesting work that people should definitely check out if they're interested, i just want to give a heads up that the book can become quite dense at times and be very slow to read   this is due to all of the historical information that hadot gives which can be overwhelming at times   i think the most important part of the book is hadot's analysis of the philosophy and it's structure which is in the middle of the book, so remember that if you ever get the book and feel like it starts slow 

hope this helps anyone thinking of getting the book "

ask yourself why you are doing x, y and z

1,"growth through tragedy a couple years ago, after grandma had died and before i came out as trans, i lived a horrible life of anxiety, depression, and ungratefulness  i spent most of my days being angry and resentful and not accomplishing anything  this culminated in breakdown that left me unable to think clearly or even leave my bed  but when something is broken it must be fixed 

it was not through practice but necessity that i started to practice stoicism  even before reading about it  it was through suffering that i built an unbreakable willpower  

only after i recovered from this depressive episode was i able to see how truly beautiful the world is  i learnt to have complete control over my emotions  i learnt to forgive but not forget 

it is through hardship that i, without even knowing it, adopted stoicism "
1,"was diogenes mentally ill? i know diogenes wasn't a stoic but of course he was one of the main reasons why stoicism came about  what i would like to know is, would be classed as mentally ill by today's standards and how much so? he seemed like someone who was able toc completely detach himself from his own ego, which i think is a really good thing, however i'm not sure how anyone completely sane could actually achieve this to the extent that diogenes apparently did  he walked around barely clothed, lived in filth with dogs and shouted at passers by  whilst i think that it shows a good example of how we should not care about the external world, especially in order to be happy these really don't sound like the actions of a sane person  was he happy? we should believe so from what we've heard about him yet it s hard to believe that someone who was a cynic and not an actual stoic could be so happy without any external sources of happiness whilst also being mentally stable "

1,"it's never to late to start again hello my friends  i would say that i am new to this sub but that would be me lying  i have created this new account after deleting my old one because if i am being honest, i did not like the person i was becoming and i felt that one of the largest obstacles to be becoming the man i am want to be, was my original account  

that being said, i wanted to essentially make this post in order to give some words of encouragement to those who believe that it is impossible for them to turn their life around  i wanted to take a second to remind those of you feeling this that it is never too late to turn your life around  we live in a crazy world, one which is filled with all manner of nastiness, harshness, and all around absurdity  so, it should come as no surprise that sometimes we as people let some of this get into the inner sanctum that is our minds or as many great stoics call it, our inner fortresses  i understand this, it is a natural thing for we are humans and we worry  but sometimes this worrying and this turmoil becomes to great and begins to consume us which causes us to go into a depression  it's than that the thoughts of doubt begin to surface 

""why is my life not what it should be?""

""why am i such a failure?""

""can i ever change?"" 

these are some of the various thoughts that cloud our minds and they are extremely difficult to shake   but i am here to tell you all, that yes you can turn your life around, you can be the person you want to be in this world  all it takes is the right blend of self belief, community, and the constant need to improve upon yourself with grit and determination  each and every one of us in this world has the ability to change and become better  we are stronger than we know, you dear reader are stronger than you know  

so while there are things within this world that we cannot control, one of the greatest things we can control is our will to go on and our will to be better people than we were yesterday  so i want to wish all of you and your families a happy and safe thanksgiving much love to all of you and last but not least

1,"life is like a dog leashed to a carriage you either get dragged by the carriage, or you could choose to walk, and let it take you places  

if you let the carriage drag you create resistance for the carriage but walking gets harder and harder, and it may actually cause more harm then good  it is like being constantly anxious about death, it may actually do good, since you will avoid things which are deemed dangerous, at the same time the constant anxiety will slowly take more years off your life, and you will become more anxious as you have been fighting time your whole life, and now going with the flow is difficult as your legs have been battered by years of resistance  but if you choose to walk, nothing good happens, you just choose this way, and at the end, you stop walking

1,"another stoic exercise in gratitude inspired by the previous post, and various articles i'd read on psychologytoday, i hope that this is a good place to carry out an exercise in gratitude  the last post gave me some things to think about (though of course thanksgiving isn't something we celebrate across the pond) 

i am grateful for having such a challenging and varied job  if it wasn't challenging, i wouldn't get to strive towards self actualisation  it's in those challenges that i find the opportunities to practice and refine my positive coping strategies  if it wasn't varied, i wouldn't be learning  to me learning is a part of every virtue and a life without learning would hardly be called living  

i am grateful for being alive and having a job to go to and food in the cupboards, when this year it could have easily gone so different 

for my senses i am more than grateful, allowing me to absorb these experiences of everything around me and find the beauty in it  where they start to fail me, i am glad that they reminded me of how rewarding it is to have them at all 

in the style of mediations (book i) 

from my relatives  set reminders to check up on people rather than care about them in secret 

from my colleague who lended me his ear  maintaining the awareness to recognise and emphasise with the state of others, which will take extra effort towards those you don't always see eye to eye with 

from my employer  for recognising the efforts of others before the efforts of your own  

from my manager  for never boasting about lost sleep or lost weekends 

from my father  answering the phone with a bit of humour which sets a positive tone from the start "
1,"if many people eventually die off ill or forgetting who they are, how does everything they have done previously matter? don t know if this is the right community, but i thought stoicism would definitely have some sort of perspective on this  to clarify, i mean that if life comes to a terrible conclusion, how does everything that happened before mean anything? i would appreciate comments or thoughts from those more knowledgeable about this subject than i am  thank you"

1,does anyone have any tips to make someone else stop complaining so much? friends of mine complain constantly and do nothing to solve the issue  i m tired of hearing it 
1,"stoic rationality in order to develop stoic rationality, we need two things 
1  clarity
2  discipline 

anyone who reads and understands stoic texts gains clarity  how to control anger, what does it mean to be a good human being, how to do one's duty etc are all addressed 

what remains is the life long commitment to these principles and that requires discipline 

so this is a post on how i think discipline can be built 

for the past 1 week, i wake up and within 1 hour complete my workout, my bath, make my bed and sit down for class  for the past 1 week, i haven't watched porn and today that i did, i didnt go for a round two  i dont say these things to boast but i say this to highlight a very basic fact  little efforts make up for big results 

a 20 min workout is not big deal but as the day roll by, the novelty of waking up early and working out goes away  same for making your bed and any other task you undertake  these are simple tasks and require no effort  but if that is the case, no problem will occur if i dont do them right?
here is where i would like to disagree  every day that you make your bed or exercise, you do a thing which you didn't want to do (sleeping in late is so much more appealing) but you did it anyways because it was good for you  everyday that you dont lose your temper because the reactions of other people were never in your control, you distanced yourself from your base tendencies and gained a rational distance  
thus doing activites which are good for you like working out, reading a book, interacting socially while remembering stoic principles consistently prepare you for bigger challenges  in my case it was porn and the subsequent food binge  

so when the urge hit today, i resisted for 4 hours, ended up watching porn and fapping but did not go for a round 2 and did not binge on food  instead i chose to review some stoic concepts and get back to studying 
yesterday, my sister offered me some oreos  my mouth watered but i took only 2 biscuits and declined the rest  
today, i told my mom not to disturb me while i was attending class 

are these ground breaking things? no  but was i doing them earlier? no 

so my advice is to start with small things
1  making your bed 
2  speaking 1 less lie (the kind we tell implicitly to gain praise)
3  working out 
4  refusing junk
5  controlling yourself just once to name a few  
6  resisting porn
these activites are drawn from my life and you could name different activites  but do things consistently and you will gain discipline  the kind which goes beyond motivation and emotion and reaches towards duty and rationality 

ps  i have been posting here for a few days and i wanted to thank everyone who replied "
1,"does anyone else struggle to hate or blame others? i find myself seeing a lot of hatred and blame around me, especially as i browse reddit  through a difference in politics, race, religion, etc  even despised people like murderers and rapists i struggle to truly hate  no doubt is murder and rape wrong  and no doubt some political decisions are wrong and harmful to society  but whenever i think of the people behind these things, i can't help but think ""but they're doing what they think is right""  i'm with socrates in the belief that everyone does what they believe best, they follow their own version of right (which can often be wrong)  so for the racist shouting slurs and threatening others with violence, i can't help but feel pity because they believe that is the right way to do things and the right way to act  everyone is the subject of their biology and their environment, both of those things you ultimately cannot control  i think stoicism is largely what influences me to think this way, though i have had similar feelings even as a kid

1,tom and jerry embody stoicism 
1,"wool and fermented snail mucus if you have been interested in stoicism for some time, you will likely know that its founder was a merchant named zeno, who was ruined   all but ruined financially, when his ship sank in a storm 
what you may not know is that the commodity that made him wealthy was the murex snail, then prized for its use as a source of purple dye for imperial and senatorial robes  
the source of his wealth (the sea) and the means by which he lost it were one and the same  

years later, the emperor hadrian, (famed for his intelligence, but also his insecurity, argumentative temperament and pettiness) recognized the son of a patrician as his  verissimus  at court (he that speaks most truthfully  both a play on his surname of verus, and his inclination and fondness for laconic, economically direct speech) 
hadrian so admired the young patrician that he wanted him to be his immediate successor, though he was still but a boy  
that patrician s son went on to become marcus aurelius antoninus, arguably the greatest emperor rome ever had 

consider if zeno had arrived safely with his shipment of murex snails, had not met crates (the cynic philosopher) and had not founded his school in athens  marcus would have likely continued his education in rhetoric and sophistry as all young patricians men did  perhaps he might even have embraced cynicism, and abandoned politics entirely!
had he not, would he have even risen to the notice of hadrian, at a time when all at the imperial court vied with each other in pursuit of glory and acclaim through fanciful and verbose rhetoric, rather than eschewing such empty vanities, choosing instead to seek a deeper understanding of truth and purpose? 
imagine how rome and the world at large would have suffered, had the thoroughly inept lucius verus become sole emperor, instead of co emperor alongside marcus 

marcus didn t want to become emperor, he would have much preferred to dedicate himself to academia  he abhorred violence (so much so that he decreed that gladiators ought to fight with dull blades rather than edged ones) yet he spent many years in command of the legions, defending rome s borders against hostile invaders  he was frequently ill, yet he travelled constantly during the antonine plague, bolstering his people s morale, ensuring that they had their emperor s love and that he would do all he could to steer rome to safety  he eventually succumbed to illness himself, most likely the very same plague that so ravaged the empire 

we cannot hope to avoid the unavoidable, so long as we do, we will be wretched 
as marcus aurelius himself said
 the impediment to action advances action  what stands in the way becomes the way 

tldr  zeno of citium was wholly invested in a shipment of murex snails, used chiefly to dye robes purple, the royal colour  
the ship sank  he survived  having nothing to do, he sought out a philosopher and became inspired to found his own school of philosophical thought  thanks to his suffering and psychological fortitude, marcus aurelius and countless others had, and still have a system to look to, by which they can learn to bear their burdens more gracefully and to rejoice in the ability to do so"

if you dont want to do that then just put up with them (ignore them), there's no reason to downvote anyone  or if you do then you should explain why like said earlier

i don't think so  not really 

rationally we understand that  negative  things like that are a part of the experience 

and yet, we act surprised when something like that happens 

and decide to react, get mad

 gt superstition

it should need no explanation, we all know what it is, but unexamined superstitions are still common  not everyone is a full time scientist or logician dedicated to understanding every aspect of the world, so we still commit to superstitious ideas from time to time without noticing  the practice is to be aware that we can still grow more if we try to replace them with proper understanding 

 gt

 gt suspicion

by this i mean the kind of suspicion that fuels conspiracy theories, political polarization, prejudices and fear of the ""other""  this kind of media is everywhere on the news, from all sides of the spectrum  everyone will want to make you be part of the in group by demonizing other groups  have you noticed if you're doing it already?

 gt intuition

every time you just ""feel"" you know something but haven't really given it a proper thought  it sticks in the mind and it seems almost harmless, yet it isn't  without reason to tame it, intuition can make you believe all sorts of nonsense  as an extreme example, flat earthers believe the earth is flat because it looks flat  that's about it  if their intuition says it, it must be true  right, you think it's funny, but aren't you doing the same but with different ideas?

 gt tradition

we keep doing something because we have always done something because it's what we've always done ever since we started doing it because it's something that we have to keep doing in order to maintain our traditions  you see? sure, it's not that traditions will make you ill all of a sudden, but so many frivolities and nonsensical ideas are simply maintained out of tradition  if you are to cultivate your mind, you must either find their real purpose or change for the better  

 amp  x200b

1,"stoicism for a better life   weekly exercise (november 25) hello there, 

diogenes laertius was a biographer and wrote extensively about the lives and philosophies of the ancient greek philosophers  the book of his we have today is the translation  lives of the eminent philosophers,  which contains a lot of the information we have about the predominant philosophers of ancient greece (which was in ionia  a region on the central part of the western coast of anatolia in present day turkey)  for this week s exercise, i will seek some inspiration from a snippet in his book regarding heraclitus ix 7 

 gt ""heraclitus called self deception an awful disease and eyesight a lying sense ""  

we lie  you lie  don't deny it, you do it every day  and worse, we lie to ourselves more than anyone else  but today's exercise is not about earning a badge of honesty  it is about earning the strength and courage to view the world more objectively than we have ever viewed it before  because we do lie to ourselves about it constantly  our lies are especially potent and poisonous regarding our impressions of our external world  

we see the world through our own perceptions and ""describe it"" in our own internal narrative  so we can't really be faulted for having an ego centric view of things  all we have ever known is the world from our perspective  but what our ancient guides try and teach us and remind us is that this view is very subjective by its nature and that we cannot make good objective choices based on a subjective view of the world around us  therefore, we must try and try hard to see the world as objectively as possible  with this objective view of the reality around us, we can make better decisions for our own lives and the greater good  

  so as a practical exercise this week, don't rush to conclusions about what you see, hear or observe  don't rush to conclusions about anything, especially your judgments, because your senses are often wrong, your emotions are overly sensitive, your hopes overly optimistic and your fears overly pessimistic    your time is valuable and your efforts are important and impactful  so make sure you take the time to absorb the pertinent information around you as best as you can (i e  as objectively as possible) before you make a judgment or decide on an action 

i wish you a productive and tranquil week  if you feel like it, share your stories and accomplishment or challenges  these stories always help inspire others

1,"i've been following a stoic philosophy without even knowing it thanks to a facebook post when i was a teenager spending hours looking at memes on facebook, i saw an image that really resonated with me, the concept was ""do not worry  can you do something about it? if yes, there is no need to worry, if no, worrying won't help""  

ever since then i've been following this philosophy, without even knowing about stoicism  with the lockdown in my country this year, i've felt like i've started to lose my peace, so i read and found out about stoicism  

i will be buying my first book on stoicism this week, meditations  i hope that this philosophy will resonate with me and that it will accompany me in my life  wish me luck!"

1,"insight into praise, hate and honesty this dawned upon me after a fight with my gf 

she was upset with me for a reason i thought was stupid  but despite being tired and in pain, i tried to keep my emotions in control and listen to her  yet she remained angry with me 

so it dawned upon me that even doing my best doesn't mean people will like it  similarly, the most atrocious people in history get praise too  example, hitler 

so, in accordance with with stoic principle of not giving value to things you can't control, i realised that getting upset after being treated badly and getting happy after being praised are all wrong reactions because praise blame and admiration is as fickle as the crowd that gives it  this lead me to believe that as long as i am doing the best i can, i shouldn't be bothered by reactions of other people  this further made me realize that if that is the case, then i have no cause to lie to anyone  

this made me realize the meaning of detachment  if all that i value is my own action, then external things like praise or hate all lose their value  thus, i am detached from these things even if i operate amidst them "
1,"what stoic text or teaching has helped you most in life? for me, i'd say this one is probably one of my favorite quotes to re read 

material things are indifferent  how we use them is not  how then may a man maintain not only steadiness and calm, but also the state of mind that is careful and neither reckless nor negligent? he can act like people playing a board game  the game pieces are neither good nor bad, nor are the dice  how can i know what the next throw of the dice will be? but to use the throw carefully and skillfully, this belongs to me  in life, too, then, the principal task is this  to distinguish and separate things, and say   externals are outside my power  my choices are within my power  where shall i seek the good and the bad? within, in the things that are my own   but in what depends on others, call nothing either good or bad, benefit or harm, or anything else of the kind   what then? does this mean we shouldn t care how we use them?  by no means  that would be a wrongful use of our faculty of choice, and so contrary to nature  external things should be used with care, because their use can be good or bad  but at the same time you should keep your composure and your calm, because the things themselves are neither good nor bad  


 epictetus, discourses 2 5 1 7"
1,"thanksgiving  a stoic practice tomorrow is thanksgiving day in united states  there is a common(at least where i'm from) tradition of naming things you are grateful for that surrounds the holiday, and i've been thinking about what this means for a stoic  because most things we would commonly name are externals(health, wealth, family, good food, a place to live, a job, even life etc ), should we still focus on them and be thankful for them, when we do not control them?

yes  in fact, we should be even more thankful for them, because we as stoics understand that we might not have them tomorrow  stoicism isn't about not loving things, it's about not taking them for granted and assuming they'll always be there  so tomorrow(or whenever), when you sit down and list things you are grateful for, keep their temporary nature in mind and you might find yourself more genuinely grateful for what fate has granted you presently

1,"would a stoic compliment or flatter someone? currently listening to an audiobook   how to think like a roman emperor 

i m sure many of you here have read or heard of this book  it talks about how philosophers in general place virtue above vanity because vanity causes you not to observe yourself objectively thereby stopping you from being virtuous  

how about when it comes to others? 

how does a stoic view complimenting or flattering someone else such as a family member or friend? so long as it s based in reality that could be considered virtuous no?"
1,"i am angry at my neighbor the neighbor yelled at my kids  she ran to her dad crying that something happened  but she was also trying to do the same thing to my girl  so he yelled at them to get out

1,"a problem with the dichotomy of control so    the things stated by stoic followers that are my judgement and actions  but i have a problem  i have used my influence and work ethic to control outcomes beyond action and internal items  

so    taking the dichotomy further, there seems to be other things within my control  granted, when things don't go right, or virtuous, i worry or try to control makes me worry, but the successes seem to outweigh the failure  granted emotionally there is stress trying to control these outcomes  

any thought about making or just having things outside of your  judgment and actions, but they are still in your control ?

small example, stoics say your rep isn't in your control or your wealth, but are they not? assuming there isn't a pandemic or 2008 crash, or a depression  or barring someone better than you manipulating your rep? 

short version, are mark twain's characters in control of things that stoics would say are outside of your control with the fence painting, for example?"

so here is my schedule 
wake up at 830am,  exercise and bath till 930 am then classes till 130 pm 

here is what happened today 
i woke up at 830 with a terrible headache and body pain  still finished my exercise by 910  but then my father went into the bathroom and didnt come out until 920  i took my bath and came out at 935  missed 5 mins of class  today was introductory class and the concepts which were being taught had already been introduced  so class was ruined  on top of that my internet was very slow today so i couldnt understand most of what was said  in addition, this particular teacher doesn't teach very well 

this all frustrated me a lot and i almost quit the class 
but then i thought of the concept of control 
the actions of my father are not in my control  the teacher's way of teaching, the internet etc are not in my control  what is in my control is to try my best 

so i stayed and in the end could answer 1 question  did i understand it all? no  does work need to be done? yes 

but i am happy that i did my duty

it caused all kinds of conflict  

now, i'm a father and i have a crushing stress which tends to make me overreact  it's like i have ptsd and my brain reacts at the slightest perceived inconvenience  

stoicism has always drawn my attention  seems like the stoics knew how tap into a level of self soothing awareness and control, perhaps by practicing letting go of that which is out of their controls

the person giving the speech gave some examples, he said something like

 gt  gt   i always told myself i'll put my trust in god and this gave me a very strong level of confidence because who could take god from you? whenever i lost something i loved i would say if you're patient god will replace replace it with something better, i had a strong resilience to negative experiences because of this

1,"human emotion has two parts, initial emotion and then what comes after  we can t control the initial, we can control the second part  i have come to the conclusion that all living creatures have emotions  these were giving as a survival mechanism  good emotions   do that again, bad emotions   don t do that again  this initial emotion is completely out of our control 

this is why your dog yelps when you accidentally step on his tail  or why you yell when someone punches you in the face  both are emotion  but there is a difference between you and your dog 

dogs don t have rational thinking, we humans do  this rational thinking is what causes our emotional pain 

once your dog is no longer in physical pain from his tail being stepped on, he moves on as if it never even happened  if we get punched in the face, we continue thinking about the act long after the physical pain goes away  we have thoughts such as  why did this person do this to me? they are such a terrible person for doing this to me  i must get back at them for doing this to me  and so on  

the good news is we have full control over this second part  but it takes a lot of practice "
1,"""you should listen to your emotions, but not necessarily agree with them"" i thought about this earlier while mediating  the way i see it, you should treat your emotions like a close observer whose judgment is of great benefit, but at the end of the day, you should also be in control of your own decisions  for example, say you are afraid  it is a good thing that you've been warned of that fear and you should accept it and pay attention to it  but maybe your reasoning determines that you should act anyway, because sometimes you have to act, even with fear  other times, you decide that your fear is justified and that avoiding the situation in place is of greater benefit 

is this a way to interpret stoicism? or could this reasoning be improved? also, do you know of any quotes that more eloquently express this idea?"

advice? thank you   "
1,"the path to a contented mind is during the act of helping giving love to other humans  not the aftermath of doing so  why is this? let me give you my thoughts 

as human beings we are social creatures  this was given to us as a survival mechanism  the act of socializing makes us feel good  it is during the act of socialize that we feel good, not the results of the act  

how do i define  socializing?  i believe this is talking with fellow humans just for the sake of doing so, giving your love to fellow humans, giving an act of kindness, or helping another  

the stoics teach us to do good and expect nothing in return  this sounds virtuous and noble and the  right thing to do   but maybe there is something more to this 

i personally believe that the good feelings are only present during the act of socializing giving love helping others  once the act is over, our brains return to normal  almost as if the act itself never even took place  

it is our rational side that continues to think about the act afterwards  if we do these things and then continue ruminating on it expect to be repaid or expect a return in affection, we forget that the actual act itself is what gave us the good feelings 

so do your act and move on, don t think about it, don t expect anything in return  this way you can move forward to help, love or socialize with the next person  this way those feelings return  but remember, after the act your brain will act like this never happened  repeat the process, and you are on your path to a contented mind "

1,"the wish for growth hi there!

i'm quite new to stoicism  currently, i'm in therapy because of burnout and anxiety and try to get my master's thesis done  to cope with my noisy mind full of negative thoughts i started using the meditation app ""waking up from sam harris"" (btw  you get free access on his website), which helped a little  also, it had some introductory lessons about stoicism by william b  irvin  this was my first contact with stoicism and i think this philosophy incorporates all the traits i wish for myself 

but at the same time i think, i am as far away from it as one can be  because of low self esteem, i always valued the opinion of others over mine  i was always quiet and cautious of saying the wrong thing in fear of leaving a negative impression  

but i think what stands most in the way of finishing my thesis is the fear of not accomplishing enough  it doesn't matter if it's study related or hobbies like playing an instrument or working out  i have always the feeling i could be better  i should be better  i easily get envious of others and start avoiding trying at all  

in my understanding, one part of stoicism is to accept your boundaries and work to the best of your abilities  but how do you incorporate the wish for growth? i think an accomplished stoic knows when growth is needed and can still be satisfied with his abilities 

so, how do you get a healthy balance between these two traits or do they even contradict each other?

1,"like exercise, practicing virtues doesn t always feel good  i believe it actually never feels good in the moment  but it leads to growth  view every difficult situation as training  i realized the only way to really instill these principals is to actually apply them when it matters the most

it s the uncomfortable, difficult situations that really mold us 

ive been reminding my self that every shitty thing that happens is a training opportunity 

how can i change my perspective?

how can i show compassion, courage?

what is the right thing to do, rather than the instinctive reaction?

i realized this is harder than it seems 

sometimes doing the right thing feels extremely uncomfortable  it s so easy to go on autopilot and let your built in reactions take control

you controlled yourself and no one can take that away from you "
1,"socrates' death penalty and stoicism long story short 
 socrates had to kill himself for being (probably) falsely accused 
instead of fleeing he chose to willingly accept his punishment because it would be immoral to just alter the rules  

i know socrates was no stoic  but they saw him as some kind of idol 

is his behaviour in this situation stoic in the sense of
""we should always give our best but we cannot control the outcome "" 

wouldn't it be ""doing his best"" by taking action to avoid his clearly unnecessary and unfair death?

i would like to compare this to people with a serious illness 
to my understanding this would mean one shouldn't take himself into the best medical care and just accept dying?

in my mind i wouldn't consider this giving my best  it would fall under the aspect of resignation  something stoics are mentioned not being

1,"depression is challenging and so is changing your attitudes and mindset  choose your challenge  ( stoic quotes to help with helplessness!) (disclaimer  i m not here to invalidate depression or mental illness, having suffered myself i know that each battle is different for everyone and i m just here to offer my story and some advice which helped me!) 

coming from someone who has been on multiple antidepressants over the years and insisting that nothing worked for me (i was just a hopeless wreck), i found the painful yet rewarding path to feeling ok again, all by myself  i d get angry at the thought of people telling me to just  go outside!  or  try new hobbies  i thought how can they possibly understand, i felt misunderstood and angry at the world  after coming out of a relationship with someone who i was convinced was my soulmate i decided i needed to change, not for them but for my future, i d spent so long feeling like a helpless victim and i couldn t do this to myself anymore for the sake of my future sanity and relationships  it was hard accepting that i was the main character in my life and not just a side character in theirs (sad, i know but it gets sad when you re sad)  it began with simple acts like just appreciating the shower i was in, or the warm bed yet i knew i was still burning up inside with regret, anger, hatred, resentment and about every emotion you could imagine  i tried so hard to appreciate these things but i knew that in a heartbeat i d rather have things back how they were  it was exhausting, my mind was clouded and confused, so many unanswered questions and theories about the past plagued me everyday about how someone i trusted could let me down so badly  it would have been so easy to give up on trying completely and just let the ground consume me and in the first few weeks, each second was agony but nevertheless i persisted with what i could, i had no other choice  i knew that my goal was to become unphased by  could ve, should ve, would ve  and to trust what nature laid out for me but i knew it would be a harsh reality for me to accept at the time  i began my own journey into philosophy after speaking with a friend who introduced me to stoicism, this was something i could freely research without feeling the regret and pain this relationship breakdown had given me, something i could claim as my own without being hindered by their presence, it really was like being set free from the pain  

i began by telling myself that progress isn t a straight line, you cannot simply drop emotions you ve relied on for years in a single day and at first i felt like a failure to stoicism because i simply could not do what it required of me  i couldn t help the burning nausea, pain and anger when thinking about people who had  wronged  me, the deep and embarrassing regret of my past continued to eat me up hour by hour but i kept a list of quotes from meditations (recommended by a friend!) which helped me move past those emotions specific to my situation  day after day it became easier and much quicker than you d expect, of course i have moments why i fantasize about the past and how things could ve gone but ive let 90  of it go, something i thought i d never be able to do  it s ok if you re not the perfect stoic i think, as long as you have the common goal to benefit yourself by letting go of what you cannot control  each time i d have a question about the past (a  what if?  or  why did   ?  or  how could   ? ) i would say out loud  why does it matter? it doesn t exist

enough about me   
many people have turned to stoicism after tragedy or prolonged battles with mental health  it can seem easy to slip into old ways of giving up on the world and believing that there s nothing more for you here anymore but remembering that you re here whether you like it or not is a harsh truth  loathing yourself, feeling bad and feeling all kinds of unhelpful emotions is tiring, painful and ultimately will be the end of you  learning to have faith in the future, faith in your actions and faith in what the world hands you is a hard task after many years of seemingly being constantly let down by nature  hardships are a lesson from the earth, use them to your advantage or let them by your downfall, either way is a challenge but you have to decide which challenge to take on  
i have complied some quotes (once again from meditations!) which are particularly helpful when overcoming doubt within yourself to reach a stoic state (as one could say?)

 something happens to you? good  it was meant for you by nature, woven into the pattern from the beginning 

 you can t lose the past or future because how can you lose what you don t have?
all you have in life is the present moment 
stop giving up your present moments to the past 

 treat what you don t have as nonexistent  look at what you have, the things you  value most, and think of how much you d crave them if you didn t have them  but be careful  don t feel such satisfaction that you start to overvalue them  that it would upset you to lose them 

finding purpose   
when people asked me what i thought my purpose was i d think it was a silly question  i have no purpose i thought to myself, only to be happy but over the past week (yes, that recent   ) i have made up my mind on what i would like to do in life  i have a career goal for the first time ever and i know that armed with this mindset i will not have to worry about whether it works out or not as i know i will be ok  having a drive in life has made me remove myself from meaningless and unhelpful thoughts  having the purpose in mind however, acts as a clever distraction to fantasizing about the past, a future goal to focus your mind on rather than a past to negatively reflect on

attachment is, at the light of stoicism, the source of unhappiness  why? we'll get there 

so, in short, the world is in a constant state of change  things come and things go  they get released  simply because they are not yours  the only thing you own is reason  reason and the power of reasoning  don't mistake this  you may 'have' a nice car, a nice home, a nice partner, a nice phone  you may even aspire to have such things  is there a problem? no  but a catch  they are not yours, so if your home burns down, if your car crashes, if your phone gets stolen, don't get mad  they are not yours anyway

is there anything in stoic literature or philosophy that denounces this sort of thing?

maybe it's because i'm a small business owner, but i see no problem with taking an idea, creating a product or service from it and offering it for people to voluntarily purchase,  especially  if that thing can be had for cheaper or free elsewhere if someone bothers to look

1,"for newcomers to stoicism after reading a lot of the new posts today, i learned that a lot of newcomers have been misinformed by people or companies trying to sell them a product or a dream for their own gain  i see now that these companies take the most shiny and appealing concepts of stoicism and manipulate the newcomers wishing to seek out the teachings of the stoics  

typically when there is a newcomer to stoicism, they have experienced some sort of tragic event that leads them here  this is when they are most vulnerable and susceptible to try anything to fix the horrible feelings they are having  this has them eating out of the palm of these companies peoples hands  and then they are led to believe these companies know the true teachings of stoicism but unfortunately they are being led down the wrong path  these companies do not care about you, they care about your money  do not fall for the trap  this also applies to some books, youtube videos, etc  

they prey on you when you are most vulnerable to get you to buy their book or click their youtube video for views  it s all about money  true stoic thought is to shun wealth  these people are after money, this is the opposite of the teachings of the stoics  in this way you are being taught by people who do not practice what they preach  this is a dangerous road to go down  

be careful what information you come across and what information you take in  i know you are hurting and are vulnerable  but this is the exact point where is easiest for people to manipulate you for their own gain "

1,"a lesson from my pupper im a newbie, looking to discuss and learn! 

sitting on the couch, scrolling through the mindless and endless black holes of tik tok and instagram, my little dog hopped up and snuggled right up next to me  i couldn t help but smile  

then i thought about it, why does a dog s love mean so much to me? because it is unconditional and without ulterior motives  

my anxiety comes a lot from what i think others are thinking when they re with me  whether i m watching a movie with my girlfriend and worried i m boring her to death or feeling like friends have better things to do than to be with me and would rather be elsewhere, but stay out of pity for me   it causes me to push a lot of people away and it s a huge reason why i ve tried to start learning more about stoicism, in this regard about learning what is and isnt under my control  

here s where the lesson comes in  my dog does not care about my emotions  at least in the way that most people do  my dog, when she hopped up on the couch and curled up next to me, wanted to be there, and i knew that for a fact  why? because if she didn t want to be there, she wouldn t have come  

i ve always loved animals, and i think it s for this reason  they wear their hearts on their sleeves, so i never have to worry and stress about what they re feeling or thinking on the inside  i think i need to just see everyone the same way as i see my dog  because frankly, in the eyes of nature, all creatures do what they re meant to do and go where they re meant to go  and being worried about someone worrying about making me happy is a ridiculous burden to take

she had an hour spare time, however, i was about to have dinner   i have 5 minutes before i have dinner  i said,  let s talk?   oh no  she replied,  5 minutes is not long enough 
  isn t a short call better than no call?  i asked  she doesn t think so   i rather not call at all than talk a little,  she stated  

lately she has rejected the opportunities we have had to talk and has been only asking to call when she knows it s my bed time  she knows that sleep is really important to me and when it s time i ought to do nothing but sleep  however, many times have i stayed up late, waiting for her, to talk  i would use up my sleeping time to speak with her  when we do talk i would try to keep it short but despite my efforts she ll keep talking the call will last at least an hour  

it really feels like to me that she doesn t want to talk and that she purposely asks at my bed time since she knows i ll either say  i can t now  or  a short one because i m about to sleep  which she won t bother a short call  neither do i think that she appreciates the fact that i have sacrificed sleep with her  i tried to communicate with her politely yet i received tempered response  i m always the bad guy  things alike happens from time to time, then it will stop and she ll cease behaving like this  sometimes she apologised and sometimes she doesn t

i am 19 years old  it was march when lockdowns have started in our country  i am an undergraduate student  i was just into that state of pursuing my degree painstakingly  i was studious, but i only had been studying fields related to my course program  

when that quite long 'free time' during the start of lockdown came, i started to question if i am really on the right path  so i started searching about goals, and purpose in life  i became so addicted to it  i kept on searching on and on about how to succeed in life  mostly those things are on youtube  i realized that i was just academically inclined  that i haven't touched this very important aspect of my life until that time  the real world  i just noticed all my imperfections, my deficiencies  

so i kept on searching again and again  watching summaries of this and that self help book  it went on until august (5 months, got a little intro to stoicism near the end of july)  one morning that time i realized, ""hey! i haven't seen any improvement!""  i realized that knowledge is good, but it's not enough if you don't take action 

   
 

our online class started in september  i got depressed  i haven't made a significant improvement in myself  i blamed myself for not being able to realize it after a month, or even after 2 months  i've wasted 5 months of my life thinking i was significantly improving  i even thought i was ahead of my peers (stupid!)  reality slapped me! i'm now having a hard time dealing with academics  i also blamed myself for this  if only i had spent those 5 months studying in advance for this semester (which i used to do), i wouldn't experience this much struggle  i blamed myself  but some stoic quotes have helped me deal with it  stoicism is helping me deal with everything i'm facing right now  i also think that among those self help books and videos, stoicism is the superior one (i decided to stop searching for new self help ideas when i stumbled upon stoicism, although i didn't read a lot about stoicism immediately after that because i started reading those resources i've gathered first) 

after all those frustrations, i am still grateful that i m now introduced to stoicism  if i hadn t done it, i probably would have just studied academic books  yes, it could have probably helped me a lot for this semester  but stumbling upon stoicism would probably help me not just this year but especially for the rest of my life "

so i started writing today finally, i've waited years to release all the pain  but sadly it took something as full of horror ,as this pandemic is, to straighten me up, so anyway  if we always had our body and mind we wouldn't know the fragility of the said subject  we are literally ticking time bombs so why not live life stoically religous not feeding into toxicity   

everything is fleeting and its all happening right in front of us  i say be ready for whatever happens in this crazy world  crazy people are everywhere  the consumer culture and media along with big tech has ruined more lives maybe then it seems to have maybe helped, yet what makes a stoic a good one? well a tough world is sure enough to have some very very tough people  people have stories that i would love to hear  everyone in this world is just so cold, especially these day   stoics will get through this pandemic just fine 

i got past my depression and suicidal thoughts that i wouldn't act on  because of stoicism and if someone is reading this who is sees this attempt being a stoic  my advice is to do it  what do you have to lose? i wish this subject was taught in school but why isn't it? uprisings    everything is so tightly controlled by who every owns this world  history is written by the victor, yet the world could be a paradise if only living heavenly life was the only requirement to live so why not live virtuously as long as you can  but i hope theres peace after this life, ""death is but a mirage""  stay strong everyone!

1  epictetus' enchiridion (idk if there are different versions, but if so, i hope you can suggest one)
2  marcus aurelius' meditations (please suggest a an translation author for those people like me who are new to stoicism)
3  seneca's letters

i'm nearly 20, i also feel like having an existential crisis and stoicism somehow helps me deal with it  my learning curve is steep  i also find  ""growth mindset kit"" by big life journal very helpful (i introduce it to my younger siblings, it's for ages 5 11, but, unashamedly, i am actually learning a lot  it's somewhat stoic "
1,"stoic thoughts  when a chapter in a book ends you don t kick up a fuss that you may never see a chapter as good as that again, you just trust the author to continue the story  i think much of non stoic s imaginary stress is caused by looking back on memories and worrying for the future (eg  after a break up or divorce, worrying you ll never find a partner as good as they were or losing a job and wondering whether you ll find another as well paying and with people you like)  i think this is because people don t trust the process of nature, marcus aurelius wrote how chronic pain is endurable and if it isn t then it will be over at some point anyway (basically anything is endurable and if it s not, then you won t have to deal with it) and that s nature s way of writing the story (bonus  everything is alright in the end because we all end up in the same place!)  when you read a book you don t get angry at one chapter ending, you just keep reading and i think it s a good analogy for stoicism  stoicism is about putting your trust in nature s story telling, this in turn will help you lead a much less stressful life "
1,"advice on relationships i recently got into the best institute of my country and my program is direct ph d and i am 23 years old 

the workload is too much  every week i have 4 tests apart from assignment i have to complete and day long headaches have become common part of my life 

amidst all this, i look to my gf for support  is that wrong? should i be self reliant because i cant control how she reacts?

the reason i am posting this is because of an argument i had yesterday with her  it was 1 in the night  she had gone to a family function and she was upset that i didnt even ask if she reached safely, when will she be back etc 

but i told her the reason i didnt was because i didnt even leave my desk the whole day  and during the time of argument, my right knee was in pain(got hurt during the exercise) my eyes couldnt stay open, my head was aching so bad and i was tired  i didnt shout at her or lose my temper but it broke my heart when she said that it doesnt even bother her if i ask her or not  

the main cause of my pain is that she knows i have regular panic attacks because of the workload, i am unable to sleep at night, my head aches constantly and my body is in pain all the time then why can't she be more understanding? 
am i wrong here?
if yes, then how should i view this?

tl dr  my desire for my gf to be a loving caring girl causes me pain  but i think that if i detach myself then it would lead to the end of the relationship  so how can i love without getting attached to her or exprcting love and care in return?"
1,"what translation of discourses is easiest to read? i have read both meditations and letters from a stoic  i very easily understood the lessons in each  the next book on my list was to read the discourses  i bought an audiobook version translated by george long on audible  it was a duel book with the echiridion  amp  discourses  i previously read the echiridion and followed it easily  but this audiobook version i realized i couldn t really follow it well  i am having a hard time grasping this one because the translation has a lot of words that are not quite in my vocabulary  i really don t want to keep going to google to find what each word means, i feel it takes away from the flow of the lessons  does anyone have suggestions for which translation would be easiest to follow? preferably in audiobook form, i work a job that requires me to drive a lot so i would like to be able to listen while working  thanks in advance "
1,"the pleasure from consumption mindset and productive mindset   there are two types of pleasure, the pleasure of consumption and pleasure of production  the pleasure of consumption is basically consuming media, books, art, food, etc  by pleasure of production, i mean producing some output, creating something, getting something accomplished or achieving some goal  

when we are too engrossed in consumption, the productive mindset feels repulsive  at that point, we just want to stick to our screens for hours, listen to music, keep eating and keep trying to escape from our productive side 

to experience the pleasure of a productive mindset we have to completely shun the mindset of consumption for many of us can not balance between both  we need to shut off our tvs and pcs, cancel the streaming service subscription, block addictive websites  we can experience the same or even more pleasure from our productive mindset "

1,"stoicism as a mid life crisis  i am 41, a father and a husband with kids  by trade i am a web developer  this past year i found the stoics through one of ryan holidays books  it has led me down a road that seems to be making things better in my life  i am calmer, i have started a daily journal and have started the process of reducing my anxiety medications  i had someone come to me the other day and say that all of this is just a mid life crisis on my part  my response was one of humor, ""at least its not fake breasts and a corvette""  but it got me to thinking about why people would view a move to better my soul as a ""crisis""  why belittle something which seems to be improving someone? (note  i say that with full knowledge that i am not seneca or epictetus or marcus and have a long long way to go )

i am just curious if anyone else has met with this reaction? what reaction would you suggest?"
1,"how do you reconcile stoicism with injustice? i am not a stoic  but i am familiar with their ethics  i am a philosophy major, so naturally i have read discussed them a lot  despite this, i have never found a good response to the objection that stoics perpetuate oppression and injustice by deeming certain circumstances as externals when in fact these circumstances are within the agents control  
for example  it might appear to a stoic slave that they will never be freed  if this is their perception (that their slavery is inevitable  an external  out of their control) then the slave believes that fighting for their freedom is irrational, unnatural and therefore a moral bad  but what if they are wrong about their slavery? what if it is possible to become a free person and they just misjudged? i would even take it a step further and say that even if they knew it was impossible to be freed, it would still be better for them to attempt escape  
the stoic would respond to this by saying that to attempt something impossible is irrational but i would argue 2 things  
     1  it isn t good to be complicit in an oppressive system  to chalk up institutional oppression to  external  circumstance is to perpetuate the oppression and potentially make it harder for those who can escape to do so 
      2  it s more irrational to act in a way that contradicts my values  to live as a slave contradicts some pretty fundamental beliefs that i have  therefore it would be more rational just to die or suffer the consequences of my actions (attempted escape etc etc) even if i knew those actions to be impossible  

tldr  stoicism seems very problematic to me  it seems like a dangerous philosophy because it can be used for victim blaming "
1,"passion and romanticism in stoicism i was wondering if anyone can enlighten me on this, ive only read the encheiridion and a couple other texts on stoicism, but i've come across something i cant quite figure out for myself  i get that emotion is fine, especially when you might use it to fuel action that you consider virtuous, but i wonder if enjoying emotion simply for the sake of enjoying emotion could be considered stoic  if i read frankenstein and revel in the dark and foreboding feelings or the overall sense of anguish that the book exudes, i am doing nothing that helps anyone other than just enjoying myself  i might consider that moment of enjoyment of those emotions as a preferred indifferent but i am not quite sure if i could bundle that in there  can one be a romantic or passionate simply for the sake of experiencing those emotions and still be stoic? i think that the conjuring of those emotions is mostly up to me and i could shut that off it became to much, but can i still enjoy it and be stoic at the same time?

1,"stoicism and religion? just curious if anyone on here is follows any specific religion due to the fact that stoicism had a great deal of influence on the abrahamic religions, and specifically christianity which adopted a lot of its ethics and also some of its physics, primarily in relation to god (the holy spirit pneuma for example)"
1,"meditations and the fight with my wife  stoicism is for everyone  stoicism did not forsee the internet  everyday we remind ourselves that we may die tomorrow, and that we love our fate  and despite the origin of this story, stoicism has helped me  stoicism is not about perfection, it's about the road we walk 

this story is stoic, but unlike marcus it starts with a meme 

a facebook group the wife and i are in is pretty trashy  which is fun and dumber than a country carnival  the problem is, this group gravitates the worst folks on the internet  classic 

a man posts a meme about cougars at bars being sluts  not very cool  she tells me ""i think i might leave this group, there's a lot of this crap on here and it's not cool "" 

i take a look  disgusting 

""do you want to really stop this?"" i ask  she says yes  lets say she's a few drinks in, and the alcohol in her equates her to a toddler  it's hard to watch, and usually she just falls asleep 

i craft a meme that uses 2 layers of sarcasm with an honesty this gentleman wasn't ready to read  this man has lived a lie for l
10 years that i threw onto the table with my meme  

although the 100  comments of offended, and 'triggered' humans, this meme post hit him right in the chest  5 minutes after posting it, he deleted the meme  truly a victory in the meme world 

i told her there's an incredible power in humility, that this gentleman has realized the last decade of his life could have been different, and it's likely he intends to become a better person  a victory for him and the world  i am proud of what we could accomplish 

although this group intentionally tries to offend each other, he writes an apology 

she decides to post my meme on the group  aggressively  stuffing the image in the faces of everyone  and tries to throw this meme at his apology  this defeats everything we worked for 

when someone admits wrong, we welcome them in open arms  and we make them a friend  they need that more than ever  forbid that we hold our victory over their head, there we find hate 

that's what she wanted, and being the drunk toddler that my wife became, we disagreed  this is my meme, it did the job, it's done  so i grabbed her phone and deleted the meme 

then later upon continued assault, i removed her from the group  

this is not a good look  i look like a controlling husband  an obvious asshole  

i did so because i love her  because she changed someone's life for the better, and she was destroying that with her out of mind attack  attacking a man who admitted wrong?

we fought  i said nothing but the obvious  she had a good point, i took her device and removed herself from the group then gave it back  that is the demand of an evil man  a man who needs to control another person  only a disgusting controlling man would do that 

i knew by tomorrow morning the admin of the group would simply add her back 

i became the worst person imaginable  and the fodder came in  i am the worst person imaginable, and i deserve to die alone   things were thrown at me 

that's fine 

during my beration i took a moment to remind myself about life  that one day i will die, and that i love my fate, and that i love her 

she showed me my christmas presents she got me  all incredible, all things i had no idea i needed  probably the best gift anyone has ever gotten me  and proceeded to throw them in the trash 

after that, i meditated 

then i left my house, and had some time to think and send this message to you all  and thanks for everything 

life is hard  i love it, and i love you all for the clarity you bring to me everyday  be honest about your reality, and that will help someone else be honest to us 

i hope you're doing well "

1,do you believe in god? 
1,"i learned first hand the hardest thing for a person to do is to admit they have accountability it s the hardest thing in the world  in an argument where the bad guy is unclear, blame gets shifted and tossed until the majority find someone to take all the fault and move on  narratives are constructed that  feel good  to people and the truth that was never looked for is lost forever  

in my particular situation, i looked for a compromise wherein both parties could admit their mistakes  i yearned for validation of my points saying   i admit my role, but you played a role as well   they were ignored and met with  well you did x and y in the past, so this situation must ve been your fault as well  i think we should stop being friends   the context stopped mattering  even if i wasnt guilty i was perceived as guilty because it was the easier option to them  the context no longer mattered  

it s the hardest thing in the world for people to admit culpability  it s not in some people s interests to look for the truth, they want a narrative that feels good  if you want a stoic lifestyle, find yourself friends that can take accountability or they will walk on you  

to be labeled as  that angry guy  when it was easier than admitting any fault, they want me so bad to become the narrative that they created  they would be thrilled if i became the embodiment of it  i say don t acknowledge people like that  the moment someone has categorized you into a folder where you ve lost credibility before you ve even began talking, take a long look at them and think about that relationship  some people don t want you to be stoic  they would never want to admit you re level headed, because it doesn t fit their narrative  don t take the bait "

among all this, the biggest problem i have is forcing myself to believe there s some magnanimous, perfect structure to it all  the logos  marcus goes on and on about the logos  it s so important, a facet of stoicism  an interweaving foundation of everything ever, and it s supposedly perfect  this is the perfect structure? perfect? i m expected to believe that this is everything? the rest of my life consumed by labor while those in power profit, and innocents below them die? 

i suppose i sympathize with the epicureans  everything s arbitrary, and that s why none of it matters  i don t want to think like that, though  i ve always been a nihilistic person, and i don t want to be anymore  i want to reject this view point, but i simply can t free myself from it  i want the logos to be real so bad but it s just not  perhaps someone wiser than i can convince me  i m not sure

1,"where to begin? hoping to change my life by changing my mindset hello everyone  after having come across the philosophy of stoicism through numerous youtube videos and authors such as ryan holiday i felt quite drawn to it as a whole  i'm not sure if its the novelty of finding out something new or what but i'm truly interested in its practice and its potential benefit in improving my own life 

i am a late 20's male  i have lived my entire life in fear riddled with constant depression and anxiety  as a teenager i was depressed most of the time and could not tell anyone, also i would also be scared nervous all the time and as a young adult i realised it was anxiety  these two emotions ruled my life and governed every decision i have ever made  now its not that i didn't manage to get anywhere  i went to school, became a professional in a career many would be proud to be in and others impressed by  its just the difficulty these emotions cause in my day to day life  simple tasks becoming difficult  fear of the unknown, fear of the future, irrational fears of things i cannot possibly know or control and i feel it has truly limited my ability to live life to its fullest 

2020 has been a challenging year for many of us  personally,  i was unable to find a job (and still haven't) this was partly due to covid and partly due to fear and anxiety on my part  i've also had a myriad of health issues which were bad enough for me to consider the possibility that i may not make it to the year 2021  now that i'm feeling better i've noticed a change in my overall personality in a positive way  i look back at things i was scared off and wonder why, looked at things i didn't do because of fear and wondered why  so many regrets as such a young individual and it scared me too my core that i may never get to experience life as many others do 

now i understand that stoicism cannot cure an underlying medical condition and stop anxiety issues  however, i do believe that it may provide me with a mindset that will be beneficial and conducive to living the life i truly want to live  one without fear but purpose, drive and happiness  i'm ready to take life into my own hands now, and if i don't act i know my mind will slip back into its old ways 

so if anyone can guide me on how an individual with no prior knowledge on stoicism and what it entails can start and how it can influence my life i will really appreciate it "

1,"can you be happy without becoming the best version of yourself? a few dear friends of mine do seem happy and fulfilled  however, they do now live a virtuous life in the stoical sense  they give it their best at work, but they limit the efforts to their weekly 40 hours  apart from those weekly 40 hours, they do not spend any time improving themselves or becoming better versions of themselves  they spend all their non work time hanging out with friends and family, playing videogames, playing sports, etc  they invest no time in reading books or learning new skills  

from how i understand stoicism, this cannot lead to a happy and fulfilled life  yet, they seem like the most happy people i know  they seem carefree and enjoying their lives to the fullest  

i'm inquisitive about the stoic views on people like them  do they have a happy life in the stoic sense? or could they be even more content? how? because stoicism is about a happy life, not a perfect life

1,"being emotionless is not the goal the quality of a good character doesn't lie in not feeling external pain, not feeling emotions, not feeling when bad external things happen to us 

instead, it's about translating and  judging  the emotions, feelings, and natural movements of the soul in a way that is morally good and rational 

only a psychopath could be indifferent about losing a loved one or about millions of people dying in covid all over the world 

it s how you translate those emotions 

life runs its course and some things in life will necessarily create negative feelings and impulses  what makes the difference is judging those feelings correctly and putting them into the right framework 

when things are not under our control, they are indifferent  we don't care, we don t judge  when things are our control, we take the correct action  we think the right thoughts  we act like we should, in the present

so what should i do when i don't feel like i can stand up for myself or my values because i feel like i'm being walked over? because everytime i try and make a stand, i'll get the ""what are you going to do about it"" response and i feel like i'm left with 2 options  i can either try to ""be the bigger man"" and start intensifying the situation, or i can just let it go, which roots me in the problem further  the issue i have with the first option is that i feel like i can't really do anything, because i know from stoic teachings that i can't change how someone is going to behave, only how i react to that behavior  i don't feel like i'm afraid to make a stand, i just don't feel like it would do anything  sure i could keep asserting myself, but that's all i feel like i could ever do  and then the problem with the second problem seems self explanatory, i'll be digging the hole even further down  so, what would be the appropriate stoic response here, because i'm at a brick wall?

some time ago, he wronged me  i thought the best thing was to talk with him in the open  i plainly and mostly calmly told him that what he was doing was wrong while it was happening  i told him that what he did was wrong after it happened  nothing  he was too busy to talk, too upset, non responsive, pretending that nothing was wrong, denying everything, pretending that it's my fault for being angry, etc  nothing even close to an apology or acknowledging that what he did was wrong  

what is a stoic way to deal with this or move forward? if it was anybody else, i would just drop contact with them and move on  i've pretty much done the same here, but since he is my brother, i feel that i cannot stop all contact  there are family functions, etc, when we must interact  

i get angry when i think about the situation  angry at what he did  perhaps even more angry at myself for not being able to stop him in the moment  he is difficult to stop because of his controlling personality    the ""frame"" that he has always had is that he always gets what he wants no matter what  

if he had apologized after the fact, it would have been something, maybe  or maybe not    i would have just felt like a weak b  who got thrown an apology as scraps  but he hasn't even done that! he has refused to even acknowledge that there was anything wrong   he is pretending that he has no idea why i am upset  

should i move on with nothing, not even an apology? the thing is not just about the past    it's his personality, and he will get me again  so i am justifying my anger by telling myself that if i am not angry, then i have to pretend everything is normal  but if i pretend everything is normal, our relationship will improve, he will wrong and manipulate me again "

1,"thought about anger i had in my journal i struggle with anger, and people who i see as ""annoying"" at times which i shouldn't do  

i'm relatively new to stoicism, but i felt happy about this i wrote  tell me that you think of it, and holes in my logic (so hopefully i and maybe some others who need it can learn)  

  

when someone or something is about to anger you, or vex you, firstly think you yourself, ""what virtue can i use to overcome this, which would be a mark of good fortune?"" 

also realize that this does not matter  we forget, and life will inevitably go on  by being angered by this, you are letting externals, both men and gods, manipulate you and throw you around  you are putting york happiness in the hands of others  

you just accept it and now, think objectively  you know there are certainly those in society whom, at times, act irrationally or unjustly for the believe it will acquire them that which is of worth to them, more than virtue  and this you cannot control  did you expect everyone to be perfect, for this to never happen to you? so why let it surprise you, then? 

""but i thought i knew this person, this is unlike them ""

well of you expected them to never change and be static forever, then you are a fool  for this would give them tenfold more integrity and grounding than that which you seek  that of a sage  

""but this keeps happening, over and over, and especially now i cannot deal with this "" 

but does this keep you from practicing virtue, living a smoothly flowing life, disturb your happiness and tranquility?

 if the answer is yes, then that is fortunate, so long you see this as an opportunity to reflect inward, accepting the past and your past mindset  to act virtuously once again, to act objectively and learn from the past  

if the answer is no, then this too is fortunate  for you have passed another test of your virtue and from this you can learn also

1,"new to stoicism i noticed that i am having less fun in certain situations than i would have before i began practicing stoicism  i think it is because i try to think through everything before i do it  now, the things that i would have thought fun before( usually things with friends) i just think it irrational or unnecessary  my question is does stoicism have to make you boring, or more so than before?"
1,"stoicism on friendship and having best friends for the past months i ve been experiencing this near nihilistic approach towards many things that occurred in my life  i even extended this to my friends especially during their birthdays  i wished them a happy birthday and later told them it s nothing special, because everyone has a birthday  

on november 21, this  belief  bit me back when i felt lonely when very few of my buddies text call to wish me a happy birthday  by few i mean 2 10 close circles that i currently have  i m not saying that the reason they forgot don t wanna wish is because how i treated their birthday  that was just a banter on my half and they know it  we share jokes this way  

now maybe i should not care much about this that seem petty but as someone who considered this group of people as my close circles, i can t help to get disappointed for not getting a simple wish or an acknowledged on my  special day

but then i see others in the same field as me, who are just constantly knocking it out of the park  tons of blog articles, videos, projects they're creating and finishing, and recognition that comes with it  it's miles ahead of what i'm putting out, and i just feel like i'm stuck in the slow lane 

the worst part about it, is that  i have nothing intrinsically holding me back  from doing that, other than myself  i'm horrible at time management, procrastination, and distractions  if i could actually accomplish what i set out to do on my to do list each day, this might not be that bad  but each day is a struggle to get started or see things through, and so another day ends with a half finished list that gets pushed to tomorrow 

reading about the principles of stoicism in general, i feel like there's some way of thinking that i could attach to these issues that might help me out  alternatively, something to point me in the right direction away from these feelings which compound on my already fragile motivation, and downright cripple my productivity "

1,"commentary on meditations 2 1   ""when you wake up in the morning, tell yourself   "" hi everyone, 

i'll be doing daily commentaries on various different passages from different stoics  this will serve as first and foremost a outlet for my own thoughts to become organized and coherent as i read the stoics, and as a discussion point and clarification for anyone that reads it  

 let's get started with meditations 2 1    

   ""when you wake up in the morning, tell yourself  the people i deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly  they are like this because they can't tell good from evil  but i have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own   not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine  and so none of them can hurt me  no one can implicate me in ugliness  nor can i feel angry at my relative, or hate him  we were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower  to obstruct each other is unnatural  to feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him  these are obstructions ""  

  1)   people are going to be dicks  they're going to be jerks  they're going to judge you and treat you like shit  make you mad  it's inevitable and part of human nature   humans, by our  nature, are social animals, and the social world is complex  our ancestors used these as strategies in the past to survive the harsh conditions of pre civilized society  it's part of our hardwiring  

  2)   however, as stoics, we have the beauty of seeing the ""good"" part of human nature   virtue, nobility, tranquility in the face of suffering  we know what the ugliness of these things leads to  we become lesser versions of ourselves  we should not drop to the level of people who exhibit these types of social strategies  

  3)   we, are also human  the people that annoy you are human  you have the same capacity as them  this understanding should lead you to a sense of forgiveness and being unhurt  that's just how they'll act   as marcus aurelius says further down in the meditations   ""you might as well resent a fig tree for secreting juice"" 

  4)   as social creatures, we have a duty to our fellow humans (even if they are dicks) to act with virtue  it is part of our nature after all  anger and resentment don't help society in the long term  think about it   this was a king of one of the greatest ancient empires  he could have executed anyone who pissed him off with ease, think about how much self control marcus must've had  

  tldr    

  people act with bad intentions, can't ignore it  
  don't feel harmed or hurt by people with bad intentions  
  you are just like people who act with bad intentions, but you can make the choice to act with virtue "
1,"everyone and everything dies knowing that things are finite in this world is a wonderful motivator for all actions and behaviors  it gives us a perspective to love harder, live better, and be greater  you are finite  this is it  every love you have will be in this world  every accomplishment will be here in this world  every person you meet and thing you do is anchored here and needs your attention and engagement  if you stop remembering that you stop living and start dying 

this is as much a statement of gratitude as it should be of relief  you should be grateful to have everything you have  to reflect on the loves you have or have had  the experiences  the chances and choices and the shattered glass resurrects of a heart that can still hold love  this is your chance  the only one you have  be grateful you have even that shot 

and be relieved when your day comes  relieved that you put everything out there into the world  every drop of sweat and blood and tears and breath  you let the world have everything of you and you will be relieved to put down the weight of such a fulfilled life  you will have told your story and will be ready for the close  those are the lessons of dying  it s not a sadness, it is a possibility  "
1,"get over it and keep your shit together more often than not, we spend so much time whining and pining over situations that are out of our control that most of our life is consumed with lost possibilities behind us instead of the real possibilities ahead of us  i want you to start understanding the difference between what you can control and what you can t control and focusing all your time on the former and letting the latter go as often as possible  

this means not throwing a shit fit when you don t get what you want or something doesn t turn out how you planned  life doesn t care about your plans and more often than not you are not going to get what you want  so get over it and keep your shit together  no temper tantrums  no whining  no sulking 

but this piece of advice also means cultivating a sense of calm in difficult situations, because they will always come  from infancy to death you will be faced consistently with unbearable, heartbreaking moments that will be out of your control, and the value of them, the meaning and weight of them, will be had through how you react to them  what they teach you after the fact  and you can only be receptive to the lessons if you keep your shit together  "

1," new to stoicism  what would you usually do when you feel overwhelmed  amp  stressed? i am overwhelmed with the negativity and all the sad emotions feel  i recently realized no matter what, i am alone  if i feel happy or depressed, i am the only person who can help me  and i do not know how to embrace these emotions because i was denying and rejecting any emotion i perceive to be negative  i opened up myself and learned to feel and accept these emotions just about 4 5 years ago  

thus, i am having difficulty dealing with stress  i want to at least try different ways of destressing and relaxing from people who also experiences this feeling of loneliness and being alone  

if i feel anger i do not know how to vent or rant it in a healthy way  it is like i am eating it up and not releasing it  if i show or try to act upon it i always feel guilty and embarrassed which i realized should not be the case "
1,"what is the stoic response to having to care for someone that wronged you? will keep this brief  my alcoholic father, who was for the most part abusive, hugely neglectful and failed to shield me from my abusive alcoholic mother, is now dying of end stage alcoholism  after his most recent fall and the reveal that he'd been scammed four times this year, i took power of attorney and am now organising affairs for him and his partner (who is also his full time carer)  

despite my dislike of my dad (who prior to this i had cut out for years), i've felt that i've had to take control because i am the only person in this situation with some power  for example, they are going into debt due to no money, even though my dad has  100,000  in savings  why, you ask? the alcohol dementia has made him forget his email, bank accounts, old jobs, and most of the time, what he's had for breakfast that morning  why doesn't his partner and carer sort it out? she's tried, her second language english and the administrative horror of doing things, combined with her working part time and caring for my dad full time (he doesn't pay her) have made that near impossible, and has been made all the worse by my father denying he has any health issues once she finally managed to get social services and benefits around 

it's an awful situation that on their end, sounds like a living hell, and has also made my life hellish  since i started a few weeks back, i've organized the extermination of mice and a multitude of medical appointments, including chatting to his gp and telling her that anything he says about his drinking is a lie, which led to her actually having words to him about his drinking and prescribing numerous things to lessen the impact of the damage, got my dad new glasses, chased off and got a refund back from one of the companies that scammed him (a very ugly process that involved legal action and trading standards), and am organizing that he and his carer get monthly payments from his private pension, and will be taking control of his accounts and essentially, controlling all of his affairs  so, it's a lot  and i'm not getting paid for it  i'm self employed so most weeks i've just been working until 2am to fit in my work around the phone calls, paperwork, time spent organizing etc  my partner and i have even sent them money from our precious savings until they are able to get acess to the private pension 

i am making a huge sacrifice here  my partner, who is supportive, is too  our lives aren't wrecked, but it was a huge hit  for someone who does not appreciate it, at all  my dad barely notices what i'm doing  i noticed, as well, that he had offered to pay his other lpa people  i asked who they were and he doesn't remember  i know that when this is all done, it looks like any money he has is going on care, and of course, his  400  a month alcohol habit  there's also the dark knowledge that he would not do the same for me  when i was 16 and homeless, he didn't care and didn't help  he was a terrible dad 

i also had to spend my adolescence caring for my alcoholic mother  i am struggling with feelings of resentment and bitterness, especially because a few weeks prior to the power of attorney i felt that our lives were coming into some sort of order  my c ptsd (which my dad massively contributed to) was getting better, work was getting better, we had started some new healthy lifestyle habits etc  

it feels like my parents just wreck my life, always  well, they have done  and despite the efforts i've had with cutting them out, literally leaving the country where they live, and building my own life which i'm happy within the face of catastrophic c ptsd, i am still just tied to these arseholes 

most days, i'm alright, i'm functional  i'm so exhausted i just keep doing things, focus on the next task  

how would a stoic handle this situation   in terms of coping with it?"

1,"not even being able to escape i spent last night watching videos about people like alex lewis and yet i'm still annoyed at my own relatively trivial problems  very unphilosophical  the issue is that they still affect me and i can't not think about them 

firstly, i've had ear problems for a long time  i finally sorted most of them out after having a polypectomy and mastoidectomy  but the tinnitus i've had for as long as i can remember is still here and sometimes it's so bad i don't want to read  it's not one of those things one can just forget about if it's bad enough  secondly, about a year ago i developed some kind of urinary infection out of nowhere and i've had all sorts of issues in that area every day since  i have to get up to go to the toilet constantly and i almost always feel like i need to go the toilet even when i don't  it's a terrible feeling  these two problems combined make reading a chore sometimes  the only way i don't succumb to a black depression  reading and writing are my main hobbies  is to go day by day  i could live with the tinnitus, but this urinary problem, whatever it is, won't go away despite multiple trips to gps and hospital checks  not sure how to deal with these problems 

i'm reading meditations after having read irvine's guide to the good life and a collection of cynic sayings  problem is, not matter how much i try to take on the principles of stoicism, i just can't blank out these problems  i would honestly rather have an excruciating pain whenever i moved my arm or leg than have these constant and more psychologically subtle problems which are hampering my creativity and not even allowing me to escape easily  i don't really know if i have a concrete question, but is there a specific stoic saying about how to blank out  well, it's not quite pain  all the advice about disregarding everything that's in the mind is valuable, but the problem is it's the mind that causes these problems in the first place  marcus probably considered the mind as a separate and spiritual element whereas today we know that everything is organic, chemical and caused by the brain "
1,"my recent life story hello guys, i wanted to share my story with you and ask for independent opinion 
i am 27 male from small country in europe , i work in accounting   audit company and i am at senior level first time in my life this year 
3 weeks ago i was coming home from work and received phone call from my friend (i have couple of good friends from elementary school times and we keep on together in some extent) 
he was repairing my bike and he informed me that it is ready  i came to his garage, we had small chat , mood was good (friday evening etc ) after some minutes there was moment where i mentioned something about  kevlar , he suddenly told me that he ll show me something, in couple of seconds i had some shitty glove on my right hand and he run knife through my hand  unfortunately glove did not make it and he cut my hand  he reacted quickly , gave me some bandage and took me to hospital   i could not move with my pinky finger   there was plastic surgery of my pinky finger tendon and after 3 weeks, yesterday they put the big bandage down  my hand looks terrible, i used to workout and bike and run for last couple of months in good tempo and these weeks were bad  i felt so much anger over my friend , he was sorry and felt terrible after all of that, but i somehow cannot get over it  today i talked with him in person after 3 weeks, because i could not see him because of rage  i told him all my thoughts and feelings through little tears that came  and asked him for money  he gave them to me  (1 month salary)  my rehabilitation starts from monday and i want try to go back to work too   i feel like i had my life pretty set up (sports, family, girlfriend, good work ethic) and now this thing happened and i feel little broken by that thing  in work i did not tell truth still (i told them that i cut myself)  i want to try moving forward but i cannot think clearly as there are many emotions that i try to go through  could you guys tell me your opinion on this subject ? i would be very grateful  thank you"
1,"quality on this sub recently hi, 
i do not know if it is just me, but i feel like this sub has lost some quality  when i read the faq this stoic community seems open, thought out, tolerant and self critical  but most posts in the last weeks were either pretty uninspiring, self validating without any new enriching ideas, or things like ""feelings don't matter"", which is very far from any good philosophy, at least in my opinion 

so i would like to hear your opinions on this, because this sub has brought me little good in the past two months, sometimes even harmful thoughts and concepts  

maybe this is just me and maybe stoicism just isn't my thing, but i remember feeling better after visiting this sub, so that's something "
1,"confused about desires?  i feel so strange  i absolutely do not feel anything from being virtuous  i applied the indifference to anything external so that we should not have desires because they are out of your control  i do those things since it makes sense and i just focused on my virtues, but i do not feel anything  am i doing something wrong? am i suppose to feel this way when applying stoicism? i feel quite empty and possibly bored  maybe a hint of sadness, but am i suppose to feel this way? at the same time  i don't feel like doing anything  everything just feels like it's out of my control "
1,"how do you deal with privilege guilt? i come from a privileged background  i was laid off like many other people, but have a great safety net thanks to hard working and supportive parents  that's not the case with some of the people i know who are really struggling, beyond depressed due to money troubles  you switch on the news and you see stories of people being evicted, others driven to the point of queuing in ""breadlines""  and i'm just sitting here, not being able to relate to any of that because of how lucky i am  how do you deal with the ""starving kids in africa"" syndrome  when everything you see on social media and the news is a reminder of how much of a privileged c  nt you are  i've been coping with these for a few months by reminding myself that no matter how well meaning you are you can't all the problems in the world  i empathize with the issues and the suffering but i can't do anything beyond the ""thoughts and prayers"" platitude that only serves to soothe your guilt, virtue signaling and all that  i was really depressed because of this for a while until i decided to stop doomscrolling, stop watching the news and avoid anything that is just too sad, bury my head in the sand  and it worked, i've been happier since but you can't completely do that  one day you'll go out to get something and by accident manage to hear on the radio or eavesdrop on someone mentioning some tragedy somewhere and you get that reminder of how powerless you are and how you'll probably go your whole life without something like that ever happening to you, and it just ruins your day  pretending the world is sunshine and rainbows and remaining willfully ignorant is a coping strategy that works  people in the old days never had to deal with this much information  you'd spend your whole life in a small quiet town isolated from the news of war, suffering that went on in the other side of the world  ignorance is bliss, it just sucks that this is the way it works  try to empathize with all the suffering that's going on and you will find yourself going crazy soon

1,"can i be a stoic if i regularly indulge in unproductive things, such as videogames? the stoic values and way of living speak to me, and i want to become a practicing stoic  i want to improve my overall life by changing how i perceive feelings and events in my life  i firmly believe that ""the happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts""   marcus aurelius 

however, i'm having trouble figuring out how i can be the best version of myself while being happy  i invest a decent amount of time reading books (3 4 books a month), being with family and friends, working, and exercising (just up to the point of a healthy body)  additionally, i feel like i have to prove myself and become ""the best version of myself"" in my career  to do that, i try to spend much time studying (e g , for work related certifications)  in that sense, i feel like i'm failing stoic values when i play videogames (with or without friends)  

for example, it's 5 p m  (or 17 00) on a sunday during covid  i woke up at 8 a m , spent time with my wife (e g , sunday dinner and going for a walk), read a book, and spent a few hours studying for work related certifications  at that moment, i feel tired of studying and reading, and i long to play some videogames with my friends  would that be considered acceptable in stoicism? if i understand stoicism correctly, playing videogames instead of studying would not be ""virtuous,"" adding value to your life or improving yourself  on the other hand, i love to play video games, and i believe it brings me joy and happiness  that said, it only provides instant gratification and no long term fulfillment  

i feel guilty whenever i play a videogame, because i could have spent time studying and improving my career  on the other hand, i feel less happy when i study and don't enjoy my life to the fullest  i think i'm not going to be as happy as i could be if i'm ""virtuous"" all the time  likewise, i think i'm not going to be as satisfied as i could be if i don't have the best career i can  to me, these feel like stoic values are clashing  (1) becoming the best version of yourself, virtuousness, and (2) enjoying the present moment "

1,"feelings don't matter  story time   today i was outdoor at a place with my new friends and i saw my ex there, first i was a little unsure coz of all the mask and outfit  i felt nothing, but as soon as we got near her, it got confirmed it was her only, and my vunreability struck me down like a bitch  

little back story   we had a ugly breakup, and we hurt each other's ego pretty bad which ig atleast for me is the reason for feeling this way, even though talked later alright i e recently   it still looks pretty ugly on my side but whatever 

later in story    i panicked, i felt a rush in body telling me to hide, my body couldn't resist to run on the back of some walls, where she wouln't be able to see me , my friends were looking at me and asked wassup? i told them i don't want her to see coz she ll annoy me and all  i felt embarrased but later, coz ""at that moment"" i was lil overwhelmed by shit itself, i aversed every peice of myself from her, after i confirmed she was gone we moved forward to sit, i started recollecting quotes, passages, my own past experience, i got a more aware of my self and all , but the feeling wasn't gone

i was pissed at myself for behaving like that,  started questioning my myself, what was the point of the spending all that time in learning , understanding and trying implement stoicism when i'm just fall gonna break like this, i recollected all my knowledge again, and everything was telling me to just chill and say a hi  but i could't so examined my feelings at that time  

my 'non stoic' old normal mentality is weak infront of her, i feel vunreable, inferior, intimidated (idk more term for ugly feeling in my gut) even though i didn't wanna admit this before, but fuck it   i have examined and i don't wanna lie anymore to myself  then stoicism comes in the play when i have accepted that how badly i feel so fucked

i understand she is external, so she can't harm me, untill i choose to be harmed  i should not desire or averse to her for the same reason, but the point   the feeling wasn't going away and i bet it ll come again at times like this but why should i care?   yes i still feel like shit (while writing this) and maybe am gonna later too ( premeditatio malorum )  but atleast now i am fully aware and    in control of my truly own faculties     cause i don't control my feelings, they come they go  i can only control what i choose to do with the, ignore them?, examine and addresss the reality? be scared and do as they say?   the thing is whenver we encounter with a bad feeling our brain sceams 'fuckoff from here, fuck this'  the scream is not audible or with a clear sign, so we normally are not aware of this but we can atleast examine it later and be aware of it for the future

accept however fucked, ugly and bad you feel  don't be mad at yourself cause you feel that way and think 'i still feel bad and troubled, so maybe stoicism isn't working shit for me, thats not how stoicism works, it litreally gives all the wisdom in the world to tell you, you can and are above your feeling and emotions  so say fuck feelings, just because i feel like shit (honesty,acceptance), doesn't mean i am bound by it  ""emotions and feeling are there to serve you not the other way around   can't remember who said it""  they naturally influence your mind (cause they too want the better of you but are not very smart as stoics) but you can still be neutral by being aware of it and by all the other wisdom that is provided  ""in the moment they may get the better of you, but as soon as you get aware of it, start examining it and seprate down the facts, accept them, think whats next? or what a stoic would do next  the feeling obviously will take a little time to fade away, thats how this chemical works  with time you ll get the grip by taking things one by one

1,"memento mori   contemplation of death  remember you will die  the stoics have this wonderful practice of reminding themselves of death constantly  the buddhists also has a similar meditation called contemplation of death 

as they say, the greatest teachers in life are old age, sickness, and death  i will keep it joyful and only talk about death  i will never forget the first time i learned about death  i can t remember how old i was but i was super young 

my mother was telling me and my brother a story and the word  death  came along  my brother and i were unfamiliar with that term  my mother had to explain it and i started crying  i was not crying because i would die  i was crying because i was scared of losing her 

when you realize that you will die and everybody you love will die, it s not a fun day  it is what it is though  it is liberating to know that it will happen to all of us  death is not something to be feared or to decide for oneself (i e suicide)

death is to be embraced as a natural part of the process of life  pondering upon death brings about a sense of urgency for our time is limited  whether you believe in reincarnation, eternal hell, or heaven or nothing (nihilism) we all know and believe in death 

realizing that death comes to us all and unexpectedly should make us humble and yes also powerless because we no power over it  death will surely come and it will come on its own accord and without any heads up 

when you really think about it, it can be infuriating  we will die and we can die at anytime and we don t even how we will pass  how is it not maddening to have so little control over such a big event?

once we pass that stage of anger and frustration, what we have to humbly admit is that we do not have a choice in the matter  death is inevitable, therefore we should embrace and contemplate it  not because it is fun but because that s the only way we can make sense of life and gain wisdom 

how else will we know what to prioritize and what matters if we do not understand that we will die ? how can we start detaching and be equanimous if we don t start to fathom what is death?

no matter what happens to us in life we should always have memento mori in mind  when something great happens, good memento mori  i will die  when something bad happens, it s ok, this too will pass  memento mori 

do you see what i mean? in the grand scheme of things, all the seemingly good and bad things don t matter much  what truly matters most is the smaller things  the people we love  the people that love us back  the kindness, the love, the warmth, the care, the generosity, the peace, and all that good stuff 

all the struggles, failures, successes, material gains will not matter  you might have some status, fame even posterity but it does not matter much you will be dead 

yes, it s important to leave a legacy where others will remember you as someone who did well because truly that s the only thing you get to bring with you when you die  your karma 

that s very important  life is transient and death comes unexpectedly so make good with it and do good  now is the time to live a wholesome life 

don t deluded yourself into thinking that next week, next month, next year you will change  start now  tomorrow is not guaranteed  whatever happens to you now, always remind yourself memento mori  i will die  i will die 

why should you do that? one word  perspective

once you understand death you won t take anything and anybody for granted  last, but not least you won t take life for granted because to truly understand death is to truly appreciate life   "

the dearest person in my life is my mother, and when i was younger it was very adamant i loved her  it's like i understand peoples emotions and where they come from more than ever, but no longer can connect  whereas when i was younger i connected way more, but hardly could understand  i remember seeing a homeless man with a defeated look on his face, and i instantly started crying 

one of my biggest goals is to be able to love everyone indiscriminately, because i do want to, i just don't know how? i do realize that others are externals, therefore i shouldn't wish for them to be this way or that, but it would indeed be natural to have love for them 

the same applies for sadness  now, i'm a very happy guy, but sometimes i just want to let out a good cry  the most i can get is a single tear, or my eyes slightly watering  once that happens i just accept i won't be able to cry, take a deep breath, and try to recognize where this feeling is coming from 

my mother recently had to get an ambulance to the hospital in the middle of the night  before they showed up, she was facedown on the ground  still conscious, and was able to slightly talk to me  i didn't know if she was going to die, so i said i appreciated her and what she has done for us  though this was mostly out of the fact that a good man would say that, not because i thought i should  it makes me feel like a scumbag thinking back on it  i was a little worried during the ideal, but that's all    really makes me question my genuinity 

does anybody have a clue as to why this is, and how i could love? maybe i do, but maybe it won't show until i lose someone close  i know this isn't something that some words will be able to fix, but any pointers to where i can start, what i can contemplate on? thank you "
1,"thoughts on calls to authority and or history as a shorthand towards efficacy? tl dr  stoic ideals and reasoning don't depend on the historical or cultural importance of the writer  

i was reading the daily stoic newsletter today, and it's talking about the gettysburg address  it attempts to make some vaguely stoic connections to that speech and it's impact and intent 

it got me thinking about how much stoic content is specifically written about or advocates it's usage by prominent figures in history 

also, mostly male figures, but that's a whole other discussion!

i know that it's valuable to see marcus aurelius as an important stoic  for many, he's the way in, the first reference or at least one of the most notable  having a roman emperor 'in the ranks' of stoics is definitely exciting and compelling  seneca was a statesman 

epictetus was a slave for some time, and many of the other historical (og) stoics definitely had more humble beginnings, but marcus is probably the most referenced and highlighted 

modern thinkers (particularly the daily stoic) keep referring to other prominent leaders and thinkers, either claiming them as stoic or at least attributing stoic virtues to anecdotes about them 

again, i understand the appeal, but it also seems like a possible trap or issue  shouldn't the virtue of the idea be enough without needing to attach it to prominence?

heck, the writing in meditations often seems to be explicitly saying that those trappings don't matter 

what if we'd found meditations in a roman soldier's pack as their own writing? or heck, removing soldiering from it entirely, what if it was in a roman cobbler's uncovered home? would the writings still have the same impact on us? i think they  should  

a reasonable point, well said, should be enough on it's own 

if you've seen notable content that engages with thinkers or examples that don't draw on prominence to lend weight, i'd love to see them!

(p s  the daily stoic often bugs me, causing me to react and say 'that's not stoic!' and then wanting to come here and complain about it  that's what inspired this post, but i hope that i've transformed that impulse into a constructive question 

because just complaining about someone else's content not being properly stoic doesn't feel virtuous!)"

 amp  x200b 

i've found that while i can stay abstinent from lowly pleasures and continue on the path of self improvement it's difficult maintain a ""mind equillibrium""    


on good days i am fulfilled and happy with the thought of pursuing higher goals, on bad days however there is a certain lack of pleasure which the mind seems to need to function well  these are days on which i do the things which have to be done, while abstaining from brainless activities, but i'm not able to gain pleasure from my virtue  my brain wants simple dopamine and will produce a rather deppresive state of mind when it doesn't get it

1,"stoicism  a detailed critique stoicism is the dominant ideology of the modern world  everyone is stoic as emotions are taught to every child that they are harmful and must be destroyed by logic  this is the reason why so many people are suicidal due to stoicism people bottle up their emotions thinking that if they pretend they aren't sad then they will be happy  unfortunately, reality doesn't work like that and they gain depression through this  stoicism's role in the world is one that is nonbeneficial to most people  so it's just stoicism's role that is bad, the ideology itself surely could not be bad, right?

wrong, stoicism is quite the bad ideology itself as well  stoicism is based on the foundations of suppressing emotions for the sake of society  almost every stoic is one because they want to have social credit and to prove themselves as men or if they are a woman, to prove themselves as masculine  stoicism even if harmful to that individual will still partake in it to prove themselves  unfortunately not only did this hurt the individual since society is made up of individuals it hurts society as well  the biggest blow to stoicism would be that not everyone can be a stoic to the horror of all stoics  if a person is biologically incapable of suppressing their emotions then a stoic goes insane, they can't think this is possible because it destroys their world view  ""no! no! no! there must be something wrong, biology can't shape a person's mind that is impossible!"" even when they are given the reasons why they can't accept it 

why is this? because stoicism is their cope  they use it prematurely as a form of coping with the problems of life  even if stoicism is proven to not even be able to be done by everyone, proven not to work, and proven to be harmful to both the individual and society  the stoic still holds on as to let go would be to let go of their cope and ultimately their identity "

happy when so many circumstances  surround you ""  epictetus discourses iii xiv

i used to struggle with understanding this saying by epictetus until quite recently  as stoicism teaches that a man, in order to be happy must be self sufficient, most people often tend to begin convincing themselves that they want nothing  but it is simply impossible not to want anything and it mostly proves futile trying to convince yourself otherwise 

we want good health, we want money for certain things and a host of others  it is in fact 'arrogant' to claim that we don't want these things 

what i have come to understand from epictetus' saying is that, although we want these things and probably even need them, it is possible for us to remain comfortable and happy with not having them with good reason 

the more i study, the more i realize that the ancient stoics were just men like you and me who constantly put in efforts to become what they became   they were simply human  

stoicism i believe is the ideal operating system for the universe "
1,"how do stoics rest as they practice stoicism? i am not sure if they have mentioned this but stoicism requires practice, i e  mental practice  and practice exhausts energy, i e  mental energy  if you consistently practice stoicism, you will find yourself mentally exhausted since you keep on averting your impulses, previous mindsets, behaviours, etc 

so what is their take here? do stoics (at least modern) have ""cheat"" day (similar to food diet) where they just let their animal selves be?"
1,"how would stoics deal with enduring fasting? just a note  i'm not underweight, i'm fat and that is the reason why i'm fasting  the most troublesome part i find is that my brain beats to me to it, it just kind of tells me its not worth it and for some reason i just accept that  i believe people who practiced cynicism were the ones who went through  voluntarily suffering so they'd be the best to answer but i can't seem to find a subreddit for that "
1,"it s easy to think if i can just get that next thing then i won t need anything else  what s harder is to have fewer things and think i m content with what i have   

it s harder to adopt that stoic mindset of wanting what you already have, but how much simpler does it make life?"
1," 18m  just finished year 12  how should i spend 4 months of solitude? as the title says, i've just finished year 12 and leading up to the end i've been keeping track of things that i need to do in the holidays (from today, the 19th of nov till around mid march 2021)  i'm struggling with a few points so below they're numbered if you wish to address only one or two  )

i'd say i'm fairly contentious and my biggest fear is not having a solid plan and completely wasting 4 valuable months of my life  so far what i've done to mitigate this preemptively is 

   i've gone from 3 days to 5 days of work starting next week

   i rock climb so i can do more of that in the holidays

   like i said earlier, i've built up a small list of things such as cleaning my car (hasn't been cleaned for ages so this will take a solid day)

   got plenty of plans to visit places in nature that i've been wanting to  just day trips here and there 

 amp  x200b 

  1)  

i just finished this morning with my last exam, and although there are still a few things to do (e g  graduation ceremony, some final formalities to do in the coming weeks which require my presence at school) i already feel guilty for the break that's ahead, even though i've had a good year of hard work at school 

 amp  x200b 

  2)  

regarding the graduation as mentioned above, there is also going to be a school event (albeit smaller because of covid) called a 'formal'  not sure if it's the same in other countries but it's basically the prom of australia  anyhow, i have no desire to attend either  my family is giving me a really hard time about this and pretty much anyone that i talk to is wondering why i don't want to dress up and party with the co hort  this isn't a social issue with me, i just couldn't be fucked to spent one night like that  i'm not into drugs, alcohol, or in general being a dickhead for any longer than a few minutes  one theory i have is that i might be not wanting to go because of my friends situation  basically the last time i've gone to school with my good group of friends was two years ago and since then i haven't formed any close relationships  it's hurt me a lot  it started as, ""ok, i want to be a lone wolf for a while"", then it became necessary because school got busy, but now two years have flown by and i haven't kept good contact with my old mates either  maybe this is why i don't want to go, but i doubt it 

 amp  x200b 

  3)   

this is a major first world problem, so excuse me if i sound snobby or entitled  i'm trying to be grateful for everything  

hobbies  i have too many, and i do not know how to keep myself focused over the next 4 months where i'll inevitably have some down time even among work and training  i want to develop some new skills but right now, i'm completely paralyzed by the thought that i don't have enough time to learn everything about all my hobbies  i know it's unrealistic to expect such a thing, but i can't internalize it

tell yourself, when you find that you are thinking of what doesn't matter, ""why? is this important? will it make me closer to my objective? why am i allowing my time to be wasted? no more ""

don't blame yourself for having lost so much time in the past  it does not matter anymore and never will  live right now, with yourself  it is not if one has more material things that he is better  if you think that way, you should rethink your principles because they don't match up  the mind is the only thing  we don't fully 'own' anything else  change your thought if they are scaring you upsetting you  you have that power

1,"how to deal with negative toxic family? i'll keep this short 

alot has happened in my family through my teen years at home  death  addiction  fighting  really horrible stuff 

i left my family home a few years ago and was driven to make something better of myself  i have truly changed my life around  healthy habits like clean diet, excercise, meditation mindfulness, stoicism, travelled lots, had relationships, journal, therapy just to name a few 

my whole mentality has changed and i can tell with new people that i meet they enjoy my company as i try to have a outlook on life like ""we're all going to die one day, lets enjoy this moment"" and i try be postive in all situations, lighthearted etc 

i haven't really had any issues conflict since feeling like i grown into someone better than before 

now my family are pretty much the same as before, overall negative mindset, they are looking for arguements, they will shift blame, super hostile, walking on eggshells around them to not cause a conflict, they all argue with each other and it just seems so toxic  i am always going in there with the person i am today and i try to help  everyone mentions that i'm so healthy and always happy  i truly see the huge difference between us 

now i've tried to help them in many ways, both subtle and more upfront   they just can't stand the fact that something might be wrong with them 

i am going on a trip with them this christmas and they are already creating problems that are so minor, i even said a solution on how to solve them and they just reply stuff like ""it's so easy for you to say"" and shift blame towards me  i kind of give up trying to help them  there so stuck 

i dunno, i'm sort of ranting here but i'd like to see if anyone else have a family who just are so stuck in a negative way of living and how do you cope? have you given up trying to help if they are so resistant?"

1,"five remembrances   stoicism  the five remembrances  of buddhism seem in line with stoic philosophy, specifically  memento mori  (remember you must die)   

the five remembrances are to be meditated on with compassion 

this version is written by thich nhat hanh 

1 ) i am of the nature to grow old  there is no way to escape growing old  

2 ) i am of the nature to have ill health  there is no way to escape ill health 

3 ) i am of the nature to die  there is no way to escape death 

4 ) all that is dear to me and everyone i love are of the nature to change  there is no way to escape being separated from them 

5 ) my actions are my only true belongings  i cannot escape the consequences of my actions  my actions are the ground upon which i stand 

for the stoics, to be aware of death is to be aware of the preciousness of life  from contemplating death daily, you will begin to realize that you will not live forever  you will grow old and sick and weak and eventually die  everyone you know will die as well  do not waste any moments for the time of yesterday is already of the dead  and the future is uncertain  act now "
1,can someone give me a beginner's summary of stoicism? 
1,"stoicism for a better life   weekly exercise (november 18, 2020) hello there, 

for this week s exercise, i will look for inspiration from epictetus' discourses  this is ii 1 21 

 gt ""it will even do to socialize with men of good character, in order to model your life on theirs, whether you choose someone living or someone from the past ""  

we are all human beings  fatally flawed   full of emotions   primitive more often than we would like to admit  let's never forget this  you are not a sage  you are not perfect  you were not born with all the virtue and knowledge in the world  you are, however, on this journey of self improvement   and by choice no less  you are actively choosing to improve yourself  i mean, that is why you're currently reading this article right? so why not fully accept that we need externals to help guide us?

yes, we want to be indifferent to externals but this does not mean we cannot learn from externals  whether good or bad, externals can teach us what to do and what not to do  what to avoid and what to pursue  what epictetus is reminding us here is that we can make the effort to actively surround ourselves with role models that demonstrate and exemplify the traits we want to cultivate to help guide us towards our end goal 

  so, as a practical exercise this week, take inventory of the people around you    this includes your real life (physical) interactions and relationships as well as your virtual interactions and relationships    see if there are any bad apples that are worth removing and other good models to try and include in your entourage    this selective grooming of the people you are exposed to and hang out with is, of course, with the ultimate goal of maximizing your efforts and chances of being the best version of you that you can be 

as always i wish you a peaceful and wise week

1,"my favorite stoicism book   epictetus' the manual   a summary hey all,

it's my first post here  over the past few years, i have been curating the highlights of my books into digestible summaries with relevant quotes 

this is undoubtedly my favorite book on stoicism  short and dense of practical insights 

would love to hear your thoughts  for some reason, i resonated much more with this than with marcus aurelius' meditations (but i know that most people won't agree) 

                    

   things within vs outside of our power

there are things that are within our power, and things that fall outside our power    within our power are our own opinions, aims, desires, dislikes in sum, our own thoughts and actions    outside our power are our physical characteristics, the class into which we were born, our reputation in the eyes of others, and honors and offices that may be bestowed on us  

   let go of things beyond your power

whenever distress or displeasure arises in your mind,   remind yourself,  this is only my interpretation, not reality itself     then ask whether it falls within or outside your sphere of power  and, if it is beyond your power to control, let it go  

   try to control things out of your power and you ll suffer

if you avoid only those undesirable things which are within your control, you will never suffer by attaining something you detest  but if you try to avoid what you cannot control sickness, poverty, death you will inflict useless mental suffering upon yourself  

end the habit of despising things that are not within your power, and apply your aversion to things that are within your power 

  when you desire something outside your sphere of power, you set yourself up for disappointment  but it is within your power to avoid disappointment, by directing your desires to things that are rightfully yours to obtain and control    

   the future is beyond your control

when you hear predictions of the future, do not become fearful or excited remember that future events are beyond your control  keep the same serene mindset you had before hearing the prediction    when you understand that outside events do not touch your deepest self what matters is your interpretation and reaction you can use any circumstance to your benefit   

   accepting death

when you embrace your wife or child, remember that they are mortal beings  by accepting their nature rather than denying it, if either should die you will find the strength to bear it 

   you are in control

when you are feeling upset, angry, or sad, don t blame another for your state of mind  your condition is the result of your own opinions and interpretations  

do not wish that all things will go well with you, but that you will go well with all things 

   dealing with provocateurs or annoying people

when anyone provokes you, remember that it is actually your own opinion provoking you  it is not the person who insults or attacks you who torments your mind, but the view you take of these things  do not be fooled by how things first appear  with time and greater perspective, you can regain inner peace

  if someone tried to take control of your body and make you a slave, you would fight for freedom  yet how easily you hand over your mind to anyone who insults you  when you dwell on their words and let them dominate your thoughts, you make them your master    

   dealing with challenges

whenever a challenge arises, turn inward and ask what power you can exercise in the situation  if you meet temptation, use self control  if you meet pain, use fortitude  if you meet revulsion, use patience  

   ignore others (respect yourself)

if you find yourself acting to impress others, or avoiding action out of fear of what they might think, you have left the path  find satisfaction in following your philosophy  if you want to be respected, start by respecting yourself  

do not fret about your own significance, worrying,  i ll never become admired or renowned i m just a nobody from nowhere   is it your business to chase after political power or fame? no  find your significance within yourself  

   the philosopher

  a philosopher is one whose thoughts and emotions are internally anchored  she criticizes no one, praises no one, blames no one  she considers herself a student, not an expert  when she fails, she takes responsibility  when she succeeds, she smiles to herself  she controls her desires    she hates only those things which hinder the free use of her will  she acts with calm deliberation  if she comes across as knowing nothing in eyes of others, she does not care"

1,"are we really living according to nature? i'm fairly new to stoicism, having discovered it through reading about cbt  i'm very much drawn to the practical benefits i see from adopting a stoic approach to emotional regulation and focusing only on the things i can actually control 

one of the central ideas that i have a hard time squaring is that by living according to stoic ideas we can live according to nature  the stoics didn't have the benefits of science   either in evolutionary biology when it came to their ethics or modern physics when it came to their cosmology  for the ancient stoics the universe was an orderly place, and the defining trait of humanity was reason  

while i see that humans are uniquely capable of certain kinds of reason, there are few things that come as naturally to our species as base, thoughtless tribalism, selfishness , and emotional reasoning   all things our evolutionary past prepared us for  it just intuitively feels more like the central claim to stoicism should be to live in a way that transcends our nature 

is this something you have squared in your interpretation of stoicism, or is it something that many modern stoics just don't care that much about?"
1,"my thoughts on credit cards after reading stoic commentaries  we have usually heard the debate on whether or not to use credit cards and often times there are lot of folks (mostly from the previous generation) that strongly oppose to the idea of credit cards  one of the first advise for the people who are suffering from miserable money management is clear out their credit card bill or moreover avoid it completely 

while there is reason behind this advice, i feel the advise fails to convey the greater purpose that it should  the reason credit cards are perceived bad is because it's easy to fall into the trap of misusing credit  same is the case for alcohol, drugs, guns, etc  an immature soul experiencing these objects often fall prey to its own carnal instincts  current society makes it very easy for an immature soul to get access to these objects without proper mental training on how to use them diligently 

but is gun a vice ? no, the wielder decides to bring the virtue or vice out of it  is credit card then a vice ? no, the wielder's maturity level brings the virtue or vice out of it 

if our ultimate goal is to embrace virtue in any situation, we should focus on strengthening our soul to a point where we do not fall prey to the pitfalls that an immature soul would fail to detect  and that strengthening can be brought by   
a  knowledge of the object 
b  understanding of your faults and put rectification as a prerequisite for consumption 

i will conclude my rambling by stating the obvious 
should you use credit card ?
yes you definitely should if the situation makes sense  but the prerequisite is to understand the credit system, how the companies try to trap you into over spending, and finally analysing whether your soul is ready for it? are you mature enough ? do you have a habit of overspending? do you normally maintain expense logs? ,etc  if these things are missing , consider these as part of the application form for credit card 

such advice is more constructive because it tells the seeker that the problem is within him and that there is a tangible path to correct it

now with that perspective, i wish i could change my feelings and my beliefs with my ex  my ex had haters  people never liked her and even family members rejecting her  yet, i was passionate wanted to be close to her  she brought me happiness  i saw her as scarce and wanted to become even closer

1,"does stoicism lead to polyamory? so i had this idea a couple weeks ago, that because what our partner thinks or wants is never under our power, and feeling bad because you have been cheated on is just an impression, it looks like we shouldn t feel either bad nor betrayed because of it 

is there a solid argument that tells me that my partner should only be with me?

there are people that don t care if their couple haves sex with another person, so feeling bad because of it is definitely a matter of perception  a situation where our couple haves sex with another person is only damaging to people that see it as a bad thing, it is not the act that hurts us, but our impression 

i don t say that people should have sex with a lot of people, i just say that if it happened, it shouldn t be a problem 

i have had this dilemma for some time now, i want to say that i m not a poly person, but it looks like this is the path that stoicism would naturally lead to

yesterday, i took the wrong bus back home  it was almost 9 30 pm and i figured it out when the route was different and we started to get into deep dark areas of the city  i started to have thoughts about how, everyone will get off, the bus driver will rape and throw me in the middle of the street  i started to calculate how will i get a taxi back home? or will i be let go if it was the end of the shift for this driver? it started to become a gloomy ride for me  i eventually got the courage to speak to him  i told him that i am not from the area and i don t speak the language well  i am lost  he was nice enough to assure me that he will get me off at the terminal and which other bus i should take  
of course none of my fears happened by the grace of god  in fact, the driver was a nice guy, he let me off in the terminal in a live area with lots of people and i took the other bus back  the other driver actually called me and told me where to get off  i walked few blocks back safely  i didnt even pay for another ticket because my ticket was still valid  

how to learn to trust? because everytime i try to think it went well, a voice in me tells me  not to take it for granted

in total they spend 20 hours inside a cage, 16 of them inside an enclosed bathroom

if she woke up at at 8am they could be more than four hours at the balcony breathing fresh air  but she doesn't 

due to my family giving positive in covid except my sister, my mum is sick and i have to do the dishes, the floor, all the house chores except my sister's room 

my sister literally doesn't do shit, she stays in her room, plays on her phone, blames me for passing on the virus to my mother who is currently very sick  doesn't do the dishes, when i asked her two days ago to do my mother's bed (in which she sleeps lies all day despite my mother testing positive)   she never did it, next day i told her the same thing, she didn't do it either, she is the only being that gets me on my nerves 

insisted and told her to stop being a lazy useless fuck for once and atleast to do their bed  she lazily didn't even change place the sheets individually and scruffily placed them on the top of the bed 

also when i insisted she insulted me, shouted and called me a cunt for being so annoying  i have my own life, i have to study, workout, meditate, do all the chores and she doesn't do shit, she can't even treat the bunnies correctly 

when i tell my parents, she immediately comes downstairs shouting denying literally everything i say and insulting me in front of them  my parents who are quite old mostly don't give a fuck about what i say and they tell me to shut the fuck up caus ethey don't wanna hear her squeaky annoying screams  despite everything i say they just tell me to shut up and leave her alone 

also she doesn't even eat lunch or dinner with us, she is practically starving herself on a smoothie diet cause she doesn't know about caloric density and macronutrients  my parents don't tell her anything because they know she doesn't do shit and that she'll start screaming again

please help me i don't know how to keep up with the house, my studies, my nutrition and everything if i can't find the time for them since i have to do everything  she is also the only being that irritates me, i'm usually very laid back and chill but her attitude and selfishness really does put me off"

like, today, my dad called me out for being loud when eating but i am telling you guys i close my mouth every single time when i am eating  it's just that, i was eating a bit fast today but i had my mouth completely shut  so, i guess he heard some low sounds due to me eating fast(with mouth shut tight) 

it made me so mad when he said that because he is the one who blatantly opens his mouth when eating  my mum has told him to close his mouth as well and i have as well but he won't listen 

anyway, the point is, i got so mad, like, i felt so much anger, i was burning  thankfully i was able to leave the dinning room without exploding  got mad to the point that it almost made me tear up 

so, i need some help with this  i really want to stop feeling so sensitive to things 

my mum tends to compare me to others and that really hurts me as well  but i want to learn how to be less sensitive to that 

how can i have a stronger mindset? how can i be mentally strong? how can i improve my mental strength?

1,"how much control do we really have over our actions desires? a lot of the solace of stoicism seems to come from clearly separating the things we have control over from the things we don't  things like actions and desires usually fall into the ""things we have control over"" pile, but it isn't always so clear cut 

 amp  x200b 

an example of this is in the case of addiction  addicts occasionally feel as if they have lost control of their behaviour, and they certainly desire things they don't want to desire  as such, they can't simply ""stop desiring"" the object of the addiction, and similarly cannot be counted on to never indulge in the addition again (always be in control) 

 amp  x200b 

at the same time, however, they can't completely renounce control over their actions and desires, especially addicts who are intent on ""going sober"", because it's an ongoing process of eliminating or reducing triggers, developing more self control, etc 

 amp  x200b 

it's possible that an understanding of the psychology of addiction wasn't well developed when stoicism was being conceived, but the same concepts can be seen in someone who is infatuated by someone they know isn't good for them and they don't want to want, a phenomena which probably was around at that time 

 amp  x200b 

more generally, what proof is there that every aspect of our existence is either fully within or fully without our control? how does stoicism regard things which we can't say for sure are in one or the other realms?"

1,"existential threats here is something i would like to hear stoic thoughts about    i often think about existential threats and was wondering how stoics approach these topics  stoic texts talk a lot about things like war, tyranny, injustice and how to deal with them  i have not yet been personally confronted with them, but i think i can follow the logic of the stoic approach against these situations  existential threats, on the other hand, is not something i have come across in stoic literature yet 

interestingly, i think feel very differently about different types of threat  for example, the thought of a major natural catastrophe, like a giant asteroid impact, is not something that usually worries me  if it happens, it happens, there is nothing we can do about it 

then there is climate change and the risk of earth becoming uninhabitable for humans  this concerns me, but at the same time, it seems that there is a lot that we as a society still can do about it  so i see it as a motivator to act rather than a cause for despair 

something i feel very differently about is the threat of nuclear war  no matter how i look at it, i cannot see how i would view this threat with equanimity  i think that i am concerned not only about the consequences, but also scared of witnessing such a colossal moral failure 

i am a bit familiar with stoicism, but still struggle to understand the idea of providence  as far as i understood it, the universe was considered as ""good"" because it allows humans to live and flourish, is this a correct interpretation? how does this square with the fact that the same universe gave us the means to alter the conditions on earth to the extent that it may become uninhabitable for us?

did any of the ancient stoics consider the possibility that the foundations of human life might one day be destroyed (through human actions or other causes)? or are you aware of modern stoics who wrote about these issues? how do you approach them personally? looking forward to an interesting discussion!"

1,"to what level should indifference be taken? most of the stoics of ancient greece said that you shouldn't try to control what is out of your control  whilst this is a good rule, it just seems more more complicated than it actually sounds  if someone punches you, should you punch them back, even if they just punched you once? you can't control if they punch you or not but you could, in theory, kill them to stop it from happening again  obviously, that would be extreme  if someone is listening to loud music next to you, you can't stop them, unless you were to do so physically  what i'm trying to say is, how much should you ignore and how much should you control? almost everything can be controlled if you take extreme measures to do so  the problem is that if you let anyone do anything to you and remain indifferent, aren't you a pushover? epictetus says something in the enchiridion about allowing your land to be stolen from you and thinking of it as being ""donated"" back to where it came from  but if everyone acted like this, then the whole world would be a den of unprosecuted, free roaming thieves and stoical pushovers  so, how far should we remain indifferent when faced with problems caused by other people?"

memento mori  remembering that you are dying

if i understand the exercise correctly it s a mean of appreciating what you currently have, as it might end at any time  

the chance to meet a friend, might be the last, the chance to kiss a loved on might be the last 

it s like i can understand and value that things might be taken away from me, or rather returned   however i cant really grasp that i might be the thing that gets taken away, are you following? it s find it hard to describe but essentially i get a philosophical value out of remembering that others might die, leave or in other means disappear from me but to think about my own death, it does nothing to me as i can t really grasp it, in the same way as i can t really grasp that the universe has no edges

1,"revenge by taha muhammad ali at times   i wish

i could meet in a duel

the man who killed my father

and razed our home,

expelling me

into

a narrow country 

and if he killed me,

i d rest at last,

and if i were ready 

i would take my revenge!

 

but if it came to light,

when my rival appeared,

that he had a mother

waiting for him,

or a father who d put

his right hand over

the heart s place in his chest

whenever his son was late

even by just a quarter hour

for a meeting they d set 

then i would not kill him,

even if i could 

 

likewise   i

would not murder him

if it were soon made clear

that he had a brother or sisters

who loved him and constantly longed to see him 

or if he had a wife to greet him

and children who

couldn t bear his absence

and whom his gifts would thrill 

or if he had

friends or companions,

neighbors he knew

or allies from prison

or a hospital room,

or classmates from his school 

asking about him

and sending him regards 

 

but if he turned 

out to be on his own   

cut off like a branch from a tree   

without a mother or father, 

with neither a brother nor sister, 

wifeless, without a child, 

and without kin or neighbours or friends, 

colleagues or companions, 

then i d add not a thing to his pain 

within that aloneness   

not the torment of death, 

and not the sorrow of passing away  

instead i d be content 

to ignore him when i passed him by

on the street   as i 

convinced myself 

that paying him no attention 

in itself was a kind of revenge 

 amp nbsp 

taha muhammad ali was a palestinian poet, here he reads  revenge    as far as i know, he was not a stoic, but he deals with the desire for revenge expertly in this beautiful poem "
1,"i think the stoic preach of differentiating between ""what we can change and what we can t"" is not only a great lesson for acceptance, but a tremendous motivator as well now and then i see quotes and discussions about the topic of ""what is under our control"" and most of the time, people really talk over accepting what is not under our control  while i think this is a very solid message for itself, the part about identifying what is under our control and what we can change is another important task for self improvement 

the moment you let go of things which you know you can't control, you can focus over things you can  usually i see this aplication as self acceptance (""you can't control if it will rain tomorrow but you can control how you will feel about the rain"")  again, while i feel this is a valuable lesson, there can be a lot of other things you can change about the issue other than just you reaction to it  

from the moment i started let go of what i can't control, i saw there is a lot of things i can control  usually we don't percive this because we are so immersed in our own rumination about things we cannot change  there is also the fact that most of times the path of changing things is a arduous one, but hard or not, it is whitin our power to walk it over 

i'm sorry if my reasoning sounds to you like a cheap motivotional message, but for me stoicism is also a lesson about doing all we can in the most virtous way

1,"how your perception of what is 'right' can sabotage you there's a quote from taoism ""bend and be straight""   i think it meant that if you are yourself wrong perversed, the right thing to do would feel wrong perversed to you   too much of a good thing is a bad thing, and sometimes what you need is to reduce that good thing, and it will feel wrong to do   it will feel as if you're going the dark path, when in reality you are seeking balance   
  
for example, if you think that you have too much pride and want to correct it, you must know what 'changing' entails   it entails you feeling like you're letting everyone walk over you   it will feel wrong, it will feel perversed   but you're not really letting anyone walk over you, you just feel so because you have too much pride    hence, if you are not ready to feel 'wrong', your perception of what is right would prevent you to change in that direction    

  
let's say that you are lazy   and you've identified the cause is because you think that smart people would not try so hard, that trying too hard is for fools, or that you think that doing things with too much effort diminish the accomplishment, or something like that   if you are this person, working hard would feel like becoming a fool, a mediocrity, a time waster   if you want to change it, be ready to feel like you are wasting your time, just like the 'fools' do   however wrong this would feel to you, in reality you are just too lazy before    
  
the last example which i like is imagine a person who is spending too much time on social media, or reddit   to stop doing that would feel to him as if he is alone in the world, like he is in the dark, and that he is missing important things   when in actuality he was just using those things too much before   
  


of course, if you are already an individual with a healthy mind, you can follow what you feel is right   however, if you are 'sick' in any way, like most people, don't just follow that feeling, but be critical of it "

i have a personal philosophy that aligns quite a bit with stoicism, it's not exact but there are similarities  i developed this mentality in my early teenage years to cope with my suffering  back when i was 2 years old, 65  of my body got burned in a house fire  this incident means i will always suffer through infections, pain, discomfort, and disfigurements  i am indifferent about the suffering as long as i continue to move forward with my life  i am about to the first in my family to graduate from college, whoop!

i need help representing some of that in an art piece, i am not a very creative person  i am currently thinking of drawing myself in a position somewhat similar to socrates in the death of socrates, while flames burn my body to represent the pain that i still suffer due to the accident  in the flames, there will be a faint shape of death looking down at me  one of my arms will be out to my side allowing death to take me if she so chooses  on my other hand, there will be a simple gold ring representing my strive for education

i have been getting good grades in the past, still putting in good amount of effort and still having time to read, develop on things i like, etc  nowadays, i'm always under constant stress whether if i can even finish the course on time  good grades are also crucial for me to get to a university that i hope to go, but the teachers seem uncooperative and the courses seems inefficiently designed

1,"thoughts on laveyan satanism (otherwise known as rationalistic satanism or atheistic satanism)? i've been looking into both stoicism and laveyan satanism for a small while now, and i find myself aligning with views from both ideologies  i know satanism is painted as ""the big bad"" but the actual ideals (according to wikipedia) seem really laid back and unbothered, specifically intended to allow you to enjoy life and take pride in your carnal desires your human nature  

there are a few things i don't like about satanism and a few things i don't like about stoicism, but for the most part they are both very appealing to me and match my train of thought well  i agree with laveyan satanism philosophy in the sense that i don't allow any entity or belief system to wholly rule my decisions in life, being an outsider by nature and living as i see fit, and living by my own rules as according to my carnal desire  i also agree with stoicism's philosophy of non regret and unbothered ness  i think they are closer in nature than some would like to admit 

stoicism and laveyan satanism are close in some regards and far apart in others, i think the biggest difference is stoics seem more altruistic and self denying than satanists tend to be  by no means am i a philosopher, nor am i deep into ideology or theology  i just find both very interesting and i'm not sure if i identify with one or the other or something in between  i am curious what the thoughts of a real stoic are towards laveyan satanism "
1,"language is one of the keys to virtue i learned from the academic texts that ancient stoics was language enthusiasts and created many words that even sounded strange in their times  and that exact of many stoic words we understand wrong and even with deep studies we missed the context  and after reading stoic texts i developed an opinion that articulating stoicism have an important role in our practice  
 don t say that this will harm you, but only body and property  
 don t say that you lost your cup, but instead you give it away, so as your wife and son  
 don t say that this event is misfortune 
so i think it s very important not to express even in words wrong values and judgments and the more you talk like that with yourself and others, the more virtuous you will be  
p s  i don t advocate to preach stoicism to lay people, i advocate to refuse to talk about things that indifferent as they not "

1,"honest question  so much of stoicism seems to revolve around being content with your circumstances   e g  its not the man who has little, but he who wants more that is poor  however, being content is also identifies as something to avoid, as it prevents growth  how do these two work together? "
1,"my story i thought i'd share my story about becoming a stoic, just to provide an illustration of how somebody may think of adopting this philosophy, what kind of obstacles there may be, and how can stoicism help to improve somebody's life 

my journey began last august, when my girlfriend dumped me after four and a half years  we were dating since we were 16  i kinda saw it coming for a while, i knew that there were some problems in our relationship, but nonetheless the prospect of being alone seemed pretty scary  i'm not very skilled with woman, so my chances of finding someone else seemed pretty slim to me at that time  which made the situation look even scarier 

my first reaction, being the person i was at the time, was to blame her  i had a pretty clear idea of the whole situation  ""she wasn't good enough  she was always too pessimistic, didn't spend enough time with me, didn't get along with my friends well enough, and she wasn't even trying to change any of her mistakes even though i told her so many times what exactly she can do "" so the idea was clear   she was the one to blame, because she had somebody as perfect as me, but didn't appreciate that  well, that's alright, i can live on my own, i don't need her 

well, the problem was that even though i managed to use my anger to convince myself that i don't miss her, i still felt completely lost and clueless about what to do with my life  and as i already said, i felt very lonely and depressed 

i can't really tell you how the idea of trying out stoicism came to my mind  i might have read about it somewhere or heard about it on youtube, i might have just remembered that i heard about it some longer time ago  but it somehow came to my mind  all i knew was that it's a philosophy of not caring about circumstances and maintaining an emotionless approach  yup, i completely fell for the beginners' trap   i confused stoicism with stoicism  well, i decided to learn about it on youtube  and stumbled upon some wrong videos  i got the idea that being stoic means being an asshole who doesn't care about other people's opinions and about others in general  i also thought that stoics didn't like being wealthy and that being a stoic required pretty much living in poverty  i could go on, but i think it suffices to say that there is a lot of misinformation about stoicism on the internet  looking back at it, i'd say that some of it might have been people confusing stoicism and stoicism, another part were people misinterpretting what stoicism is about or which thoughts are the most important, and the rest was my own misinterpretation, being a complete beginner 

well, i gave up  having this improper idea of what stoicism is, i concluded that it's not for me  for the next few months i just went on with my life, trying to find my own ways to cope with all the stuff that was happening (somewhat succesfuly, but i still felt pretty lonely and had a hard time dealing with it) and then i met with stoicism again  i stumbled upon a lecture about marcus aurelius  and it painted a completely different picture than what i had in mind from my previous research  a picture of a philosophy that's first and foremost about being a good person, about being kind to your fellow humans, and about always doing what's right  it inspired me to find some literature and some more resources and to actually start digging into it  with every new detail i learned i liked the ideas of stoicism more and more  and it didn't take long and i decided that becoming a stoic is the right thing to do 

i've now been practicing for a few months  i've seen some major improvements  i'm much less stressed than i used to be  i don't care so much about bad circumstances  i value everything good that happens to me, and i usually manage to find something good about pretty much every bad thing that happens  it feels great  

after a while, i finally found the courage to think once again about my ex girlfriend and our relationship, now through the lens of my new philosophy  remembering all the things that happened, i soon discovered how much of what happened was actually my fault  how unsupportive i was and how little i valued that i even had a girlfriend  i still think she was far from perfect, but i now find it so foolish how i took for granted that i had somebody who actually cared about me (and i know she did)  and i find it absolutely disgusting how i was sometimes blaming her for things that neither of us could control  i can't help laughing at the ignorance of my past self 

it's possible that had i discovered stoicism earlier, we'd still be together  but there's no point thinking about that  i have to presume that it's a good thing that we broke up  and i do  many good things happened to me since then that wouldn't have happened had i still been in this relationship  

now i hope that i managed to learn from my mistakes and if i ever get another chance with some nice girl, i'll be the best boyfriend i can possibly be  until then i'll keep studying and putting into practice every stoic exercise i find 

if you're still here, i want to thank you for reading my story  i hope it was at least somewhat interesting  now i would love to read your story too  what brought you to stoicism? did you understand it right away or did you also fall into some beginner traps? what improvements did you register in your life since you started practising? i'd really like to know  thanks for your attention "

1,"why does religion always promise eternal life as a reward? what's the point of eternity? is one good life not good enough? studying stoicism, i suddenly found the so called, ""gift"", of abrahamic religions of eternal life as appalling  ""give up everything here on earth, for there is an eternal life with the lord waiting for you   "", that sort of thing 

 what's the point of eternal life? is one good life not good enough? 

they refused to see reality as reality and face it  they always pray and pray yet nothing changes  it is their work or the whims of fate that will change their life  by which only the former is within their control

1,"desire and aversion are (not) in our control? hey guys,

i'm am currently reading the recent published german version of irvine's guide to the good life 

he claims in chapter 5 that epictetus was wrong that desire and aversion are fully in our control 

as examples he uses situations like the craving for ice cream as an impulse or anxiety of spiders  he says we can handle the outcome of these but not the initial feeling 

but in his defence he adds that there might be some of the meaning lost in translation 

this is what i also believe 

i think the meaning of epictetus is that we must differentiate desire aversion between evolutionary human related behavior and our ""socially adapted"" behavior 

but even the evolutionary behavior is something which can change over the course of our lives, i think 

suggesting some examples about myself 
in my past i was a meat loving person whose mouth would water at the look of huge burgers  now i am a wholefood vegetarian and have nothing but disgust for meals like this 
another one  me and my wife are both cancer patients  in the first years and with current recurrences i would suffer numbing fear and anxieties of death  over the past three years studying mindfulness and   now recently at the beginning   stoicism, even this primal fear for survival can be tamed 

i would like to hear your opinion about this 

have a great day!"
1,"without a belief in the stoic virtues, can you really apply stoicism to your life? i don't believe in the ethics of virtue, it's a highly subjective list  you can't prescribe an ought from an is   i don't view anything worthwhile of me contributing to this entropic world  if we could fight entropy , i would, but we can't 

and some say to be an inspiration to others, i should suffer so others can view me as an example  no, thank you

what is virtuous in suffering through chronic pain (my personal experience), you only build mental resilience  that is good if your goal is to build that if everything else falls apart, things like your health 

people with mental illnesses die sooner, people with chronic pain die sooner, people with autoimmune disorders die sooner  i fall in all three groups 

as i age, i experience more cognitive decline, back gets worse and my bones stiff up ( ankylosing spondylitis ( i have the antigen for it, don't know if it's developed) 

my problems  kyphoscoliosis, neck lordosis, dyspraxia, dyscalculia, add, neglected as a child, allergies, skin problems (cystic acne), raynaud's syndrome, insomnia, anxiety, depression, hands tremors, still did not get the job i was supposed to get, i am depleting the last amounts of money i have 

and to find the creature i cared for 11 5 half years died in pain and i did not have money to send home so that can at least him put out of misery, i am fucking sorry my friend    it was my dog  i don't give a fuck how you view that i value a dog that much   

and you may ask, why do i keep posting, well there is this bitch called hope  here is what nietzsche said about it ""hope in reality is the worst of all evils because it prolongs the torments of man ""

but i am gonna overpower it soon i hope, life is gonna make me anyways 

even if i have something to offer to the world, i don't think it's worth it the decline that comes after 25, it's not immediate, but around that age your organism starts to age slowly and with my health that is not going to be pretty  plus everything in my life would have to be managed around my health, fuck that

1,"can this be considered stoicism stoicism to me has struggled to gain academic respect due to issues of metaphysics which i want to try and tackle, but i don't know  if i can still be considered a stoic  i believe like david hume that because you cannot derive an ought from an is living according to nature is an insufficient claim, but i think like hume that the best way of living is derived from internal moral sense  thus the providence of the natural(though not necessarily nature ) is an aspect of the mind  the rest of the universe acts in part probabilistic and part cause and effect and thus lacks intellect or the ability to question why it processes things  man has an intellect and so when he engages with the indifferent universe, his role in the natural order of things is to attach purpose to this symphony of that which is orderly and that which is random, through the practice of virtue which exists inside him that he uses to create meaning   is this still stoicism ?"

1,"this passage, i feel, perfectly sums up stoicism in a bit more elaboration than ""what is and isn't in our control"" in epictetus's discourses, book 2, chapter 5, epictetus lays out one of the most profound paragraph on stoicism i've seen 

 gt  ""what then? should we use such things carelessly?"" in no way  for  this on the other hand is bad for the faculty of the will, and consequently  against nature  but we should act carefully because the use is not indifferent  and we should also act with firmness and freedom from perturbations because  the material is indifferent  for where the material is not indifferent,  there no man can hinder me nor compel me  where i can be hindered and compelled  the obtaining of those things is not in my power, nor is it good or bad   but the use is either bad or good, and the use is in my power  but it is  difficult to mingle and to bring together these two things, the carefulness  of him who is affected by the matter and the firmness of him who has no  regard for it  but it is not impossible  and if it is, happiness is impossible   but we should act as we do in the case of a voyage  what can i do? i can  choose the master of the ship, the sailors, the day, the opportunity  then  comes a storm  what more have i to care for? for my part is done  the business  belongs to another  the master  but the ship is sinking  what then have  i to do? i do the only things that i can, not to be drowned full of fear,  nor screaming, nor blaming god, but knowing that what has been produced  must also perish  for i am not an immortal being, but a man, a part of  the whole, as an hour is a part of the day  i must be present like the  hour, and past like the hour  what difference, then, does it make to me  how i pass away, whether by being suffocated or by a fever, for i must  pass through some such means?"

  you are a creator, not a consumer  don t waste your time entertaining yourself when you can entertain others 

  you are an extremely fortunate person  let you count the ways 

  transition mindfully, going into the next situation not distracting yourself from the present, but engaging with it

  what are your goals this week? today? right now? what are you doing to work toward them?

  are you in an emotional flashback right now? what do you need to re center?

  what are you grateful for right now? who are you grateful for? what is beautiful at present?

  what can you do to make the next hour the best hour that it can possibly be?

  what is your inner critic judging you for right now? what can you say back to him to disempower him?

  who have you been unfairly critical of today? what was a better way to respond to their actions? what can you do to be nonjudgemental?

  when was the last time you were angry? good, let s extend the streak! remember  getting angry involves a fundamental misunderstanding of life and only serves to undermine your well being

  no one has intentionally harmed you, and if they did, it was because  they knew not what they did , so forgive them and move forward unburdened by vitriol

  have you meditated today? why not meditate right now?

  prioritize your own well being over and above all else, because you cannot be the best self you can be without doing so

  what have you done to take care of yourself today?

  when was the last time you exercised? did yoga? exercised? what can you do right now to improve your health?

  what past experience has bogged you down recently? did you speak back to it and let it go successfully?

  have you written a poem today? if not, how about right now?

from my readings so far there have not been many examples of practicing stoicism in different professions in a modern context  the ancient greek philosophers and marcus aurelius clearly had professions that allowed them to have an obvious contribution to society that could reflect their virtues  is it simply that now in most cases our work is a means to an end and our societal contribution should be outside of work?"

has anyone here encountered a take from any stoic philosopher on the marginal utility that spending time considering future events has? or would the response be that it's too easy to cast our thoughts to the future in ways that aren't helpful?

she had been dealing with some very difficult personal circumstances and in my personal opinion she did not deal with them fully or well, and it turned into projection (but thats a separate story)  it led her to believe that we were no longer compatible, which i agreed with partially but felt there was still a lot of work we could have done, and we enjoyed many joyous moments even until the end  we aren t enemies at the end of it 

maybe she was right, but she did decided it was enough  i was sad for a few weeks, i processed that as it was important, but i also remembered my stoic teachings 

i couldn t control how she felt, even if i felt she was wrong  even now i see its possible i may have just been too hopeful for a way through   but i had to accept her stance  i wanted nothing more than for her to be happy, if that was away from me then so be it 

 if that was away from me then so be it  is the line that got me through it  i d rather her be happy alone, or elsewhere, than to be unhappy with me  i cared about her too much to try and control things, that was never going to be an option 

it was not my desired outcome but i am at peace with it, and i grateful now more than ever for stoicism "

1,"on enjoying activities? (11 2) hello, i've been reading through meditations and one thing that struck me is verse 2 of book 11 

""2  you will despise joyous song and the dance and the combat at arms if you disintegrate the tuneful phrase into every one of its notes, and ask yourself about each whether you are its servant  for you will be ashamed  and so you will be if you do what corresponds in the case of the dance in respect of each movement or pose, and the same also in the case of the combat at arms  generally then, excepting virtue and its effects, remember to have recourse to the several parts and by analysis to go on to despise them, and to apply the same process to life as a whole  ""

i understand this has to do with the idea of indifferents, but to me the process which marcus suggests   split everything up into simpler parts    denudes them of any meaning   enjoyment 

especially when contrasted to another one of marcus' quotes 
""think of what a precious privilege it is to be alive   to breathe, to think, to enjoy, to love""

what is the nature of enjoyment according to the stoics? i don't agree with the former verse, to me it eliminates the meaningfulness of activities and the phrasing ""go on to despise them"" does not sound like enjoying being alive, and seems like it cheapens existence by reducing it to it's banal details 
i understand the ""virtue is the only good"" though i'm not sure i agree with it in this context "

1,"mind over matter i felt ill today (i don't get sick often, i believe this is the 2nd time this year), and haven't been able to keep anything down yet  so this isn't exactly a 'shower' thought, but a 'bed' thought, if you will 

i've been learning and practicing stoicism for a couple years now, however when i began to learn about stoicism, and see it's principles, i was reluctant to actually practice it for a good while  

so now, while i'm finally a more practical stoic in my day to day, i saw this illness as an opportunity to truly be indifferent upon my condition  in this state, i had a sort of epiphany  while we commonly are in a comfortable position, we don't realize how much of a blessing it is to find comfort, physically and mentally 

and, as a stoic, i've found that being uncomfortable in whatever position you lay, is also a blessing  for when the body is ill and hurt, the mind can be stilled, as we know  now, it is a blessing to be comfortable and feel the pleasure of relaxation, and to be uncomfortable and challenged in whatever way life gives you 

as long as your mind is functional, and thought is there, you can find comfort in any situation  i'm simply grateful that i'm only sick  something far worse could have happened to me before coming to this thought 

truly, it is a blessing to breathe, think, and act  as marcus mentioned "
1,"for what purpose would a stoic donate to charity? this isn t intended to be inflammatory, just genuinely curious to understand stoic philosophy 

if no value should be placed on the material, then what purpose is it to give material donations (money) to charity? and if all virtue is attainable regardless of physical situation, why should we work on improving the physical conditions of others?

in short, if virtue is not to be found in the material, why give material donations?"

1,"how do you find the discipline? hey guys,

i'm kinda new to stoicism  i've been reading about it for a while and i really think it's a way of living that has a lot of value and the potential to radically improve almost every aspect of one's existence 

now, and this is true of most any philosophy, the success of living stoicism lies in applying the basic tenets and going back to a set of central principles and perspectives  it's relatively simple, but not necessarily easy  the general feeling i have is that stoicism and a strict, no nonsense discipline really go hand in hand 

my question to you then is, how do you maintain that discipline? do you rely heavily on routines and systems? do you surround yourselves with reminders? do you use artifacts or tokens to recalibrate? do you just reread meditations every month?

i'd appreciate your perspective on this matter, and would love to learn from your experience practicing stoicism  thanks, guys "
1,"can one be a stoic and an optimistic nihilist? for those who aren t familiar, an optimistic nihilist is a person who finds freedom in mortality  they see death not as something to fear, but to embrace so you can enjoy your days as best as you can because they are so few and not guaranteed 

anybody who knows me can pretty much say i am a positive, energetic, friendly person  my boyfriend argues i can t be a stoic because i feel so deeply  and he's right about me feeling deeply and outwardly  but when life does throw me absolute steaming piles of shit to manage, or if i do find myself in a pit of despair, i don t let it damper my entire outlook on life  i take it as it is, i don t fight it, i don t complain   i just accept that shit happens and all i can do is move through it  is that stoicism? or am i so far from the mark?

so, what do you think? can a deeply feeling and expressive person be a stoic? can an optimistic nihilist be a stoic? or are the two mutually exclusive?

how would a stoic react to a situation where she he is forced to do something and the realize later it was pointless?

like it happened to me that we thought we need to head back to the student dorm to check out because of the covid situation, (i was home, 450km away roughly 6 hours on train) so i went back to the dorm to pack things up  we had to wait for the official announce which happened 2 day later and it stated that its not needed to check out and we can leave our stuff there

1,"tell me about your life before awareness of stoicism who here lived a wild life burning the candle at both ends before pulling in the reins and trying to lead a stoic life?

i m in my 30s and i ve lived an amazing life, i ve done some wild things and made a ton of mistakes along the way  stoicism and the virtues surrounding a stoic existence inspire me to change my ways as i move forward in this precious and conscious existence  

however, sometimes i m reflect on that hunter s thompson quote  
 life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty well preserved body, but rather to skid broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out and loudly proclaiming
 wow! what a ride! 

i love that quote and when you analyse the chaos of nature and the very universe in which we exist  then it resonates perfectly for me 
why be stoic, calm and still, living an existence void of passionate and risk taking behaviours that challenge fundamental norms    
you can still be kind in nature and good spirited, whilst running wild and free, revelling in the wonders to be absorbed in this precious but fleeting life     

i m not suggesting that hunters quote is a statement to avoid a stoic life and run amok but it definitely suggests taking life by the horns of the proverbial bull and hanging on for dear life while enjoying the ride

recently i got into my first long distance relationship  this whole experience has brought out emotions that are more powerful then ever before  anger love jealousy joy all of it is hitting me simultaneously and i cannot navigate this situation mentally without giving myself a headache  i feel as though each decision i make is wrong leading me down huge rabbit holes of fabricated situations that i draw up in my head    as you can imagine this cycle repeats daily

1,"stoicism and burnout hey everyone, i have been reading about stocism for a while now  some books i really enjoyed and think i learned from, others not so much  but it has always been very hard for me to implement the ideas into my everyday life and practice them  sometimes i could reach out to these ideas and they helped, sometimes they did not  but that's enough of the introduction 

so this might be a bit strange post but, i don't know how many of you experienced burnout  i mean sometimes i am not 100  sure i am experiencing it  i mean there is no pcr test for this 

i am trying to map some sort of rebuilding plan for myself which will include therapy, meditation and probably stoicism as i sympathize with the basic concepts, so i can come out of this stronger than before  however and here is the tricky part for me, currently i am not acting like a stoic  i have a job that i am leaving in   2 months, i have some duties still that are very hard for me to do, it's like taking 4 5x extra effort to do the simplest things   compared to what it used to be   and at the end of the day i don't feel i am doing my best, because i feel i can't reach my best currently and this makes me frustrated and stressed 

have any of you had gone through something similar, could stoicism help you? if so, did it help you while you were still in the same position, same work etc?"

i have also physical pain due to kyphoscoliosis, skin issues and very bad teeth  

to help my back i need to gain muscle, but i can't lift too much due to weak connective tissue  i can't swim public pools have too much chlorine and it fucks up my skin (it gets all red and it hurts, like some sort of burns) 

i have an allergy and don't know to what  raynaud's syndrome, your hands and feet are always cold, weak peripheral circulation  

i listen to stoics, every other day and try to implement it, but it all seems like cope  it's all for nothing, i am just supposed to be an automaton, be indifferent to my chronic conditions  i know i can't cure them, but living with them also seems like a bad idea from my perspective  i don't want to depend on others too much and i can't work a lot of jobs  suicide seems like the answer, as the stoics said, the door is always opened  there is a grain in me that wants to live, it's the damn survival instinct, a product of the dna delusion 

in my head a film is rolling with only one thing ""death shall set you free!"" 

i know you are going to say go to therapy, but for what?

1,"stoicism for a better life   weekly exercise (november 11) hello there, 

for this week s exercise, let us circle back to seneca (it's been a while)  this is from his moral letters to luciluis, i 7 1 

 gt ""do you ask me what you should regard as especially to be avoided? i say, crowds  for as yet you cannot trust yourself to them with safety ""  

you have two ears and one mouth, so the gods logos universe nature must want you to listen twice more than you talk right? well okay, that's not how evolution works, but the point remains valid  if we want to cultivate our relationships with other people, what do you think will be more conducive towards this goal  lecturing or listening? how can you lecture if you don't listen first to understand the need, if any, of the listener? any which way you look at it, listening (as opposed to lecturing) helps connect with people  so, as our ancient guides remind us, listen to your fellow human beings, don't perform for them  

we like to think we are the main character in our own tv show and this is normal, for we are the center and main character of our own narrative from our own internal perspective  however, never forget that our narrative is one that exists in tangent with 7 6 billion other narratives  there are tons more of other points of view out there that are not your own egocentric view 

  so as a practical exercise this week, avoid making mention at great length and excessively of your own deeds, dangers, ideas or accomplishments in your conversations    it is not as pleasant for others to hear about your adventures, as it is for you to call to mind your own dangers  instead,   truly try and listen to what others are saying    don't just wait for them to finish what they are saying before you grab the first opportunity to jump in with your own stories and ideas 

if you feel comfortable, do share some of your stories  it may very well help inspire others  i wish you a tranquil and productive week

i plan to read some of the classics, as i'm sure there is much wisdom to be gleaned from their pages    but i appreciate any other recommendations that might fit my query as well! thanks!"
1,"some paradoxical ideas? hello, i am relatively new to stoicism so please excuse any misunderstanding or ignorance on my part  i have read 'a guide to the good life' and currently going through 'how to think like a roman emperor' so far  having been through cbt processes before there are a lot of similarities that have made my introduction to stoicism much easier 

most of what i have heard read so far makes a lot of sense and i plan to start practicing  however, there are a few areas where i am bit confused since there seems to be some conflicting advice  on one hand there is advice to look at 'things' objectively (e g  "" this fine wine is just fermented grapes""), and assessing pleasures for their long term pros and cons compared to pursuing virtues  on the other hand there is advice to employ practices like negative visualisation so that you can enjoy  appreciate the 'things' you have more 

these leave me a bit confused how i am supposed to be thinking about, say, watching a movie for example  whilst watching it should i be like 'this is just a box of electronics and changing lights' or ask myself 'would i miss this if my tv was taken from me', or should i just enjoy it fully because i recognise i may not always have it  just seems like mixed signals of 'enjoy things as much as possible by appreciating they are temporary and reminding yourself of that, but realise they are nothing to be enjoyed because they are only xyz and don't improve your virtue '

would appreciate any thoughts or help in reconciling these "

do you remember when i was still a little boy and you took my genitor away? how frightened i was, how angry you made me 

do you remember how i used to wander the long narrow road? i did not know the state i was in, i moved forward day and night, without knowing my fate  i desired to leave, but you made me stay 

do you remember how mediocre i was? disorientated, i even held a grudge against nature  good people opened their doors to me, i made no effort to enter  we had sworn to be proud and worthy  

then i realised the futility of my ways, for it is once you choke that you realise that they are in pain too  the absurdity of the life we live, i had to focus, accept my condition and move in the right direction  

i wanted to thank you my dear friend, for little did i know, you led me to the common thread  freed from all pretensions, ready to become a free man, a man in service of the providence "

1,"i want to move past feelings of resentment towards my parents  first off, i recognize that i'm fortunate to have grown up in a middle class family in a first world country  my parents are still together, and have always been present in my life  but i still can't get past this feeling of resentment i carry with me  i'll break it down into the following 

  lack of social skills   school years were filled with anxiety, awkwardness, low self confidence, and lack of social awareness  i had a crippling fear of public speaking  i was a late bloomer on the dating scene, and it took many years of trial and error to get comfortable with it  i cringe hard at it all  the anxiety has lead to long term health issues, particularly with my stomach 
  lack of practical skills   cooking, cleaning, maintenance, home improvement, finance, networking, job interviews, how to dress well, hygiene, how to shave  i've been slowly been picking up these skills as i've gotten older  
  lack of a family bond   i'm probably closest to my mom  my dad was always somewhere in the background, and i don't feel like i could open up to him about anything  i always had to ask him to do the typical father son stuff with me  my sisters and i wanted nothing to do with each other growing up, but we're better now  i'd get in frequent arguments with my mom, and she would often guilt me for not starting conversations with my dad, uncle, or grandfather, even though they were the adults and i was the kid  i hardly remember any bonding time with any of them 
  location   this is the one i feel most silly about  but early on we were in a vibrant fun city with lots to explore and experience  then we moved across the country to a more isolated small town with very little to do  i look back and feel like a lot of my potential was lost with that move  but my dad moved for his career, and i feel like it's unfair to dwell on this too much 

i'm in the middle chapter of my life now, and when i have kids, i'd like to pass on as much knowledge, skills, experiences, and encouragement as i possibly can  i want them to thrive, not just exist  i never really got that feeling from my parents  i feel like i couldn't ask them for advice, and i had to teach myself everything  of course, i have no real way of knowing what they were feeling or going through when they were raising us  my parents are getting older now, and i basically just want to move forward and enjoy my time with them  i'm fully independent now, and they call every week or two which is nice, but really it's just the same conversation every time 

i realize this is pretty long winded and i should bring it up in therapy or something, but i've found some comfort in stoic philosophy in recent years  i was wondering if there were any good resources, teachings, or personal thoughts that deal with this sort of topic? it's very much appreciated "
1,"this too shall pass maybe not exactly a stoic principle, but more of a personal take on stoic philosophy 

i had a moment today when i thought about how much my life has changed in just 5 years  five years ago i remember being really worked up about what some coworker thought of me, or worrying about if the gym i liked was going to close  now i don't even live in the same town as that gym (which did eventually close) and i don't work with that coworker anymore, and in fact, i have no idea where they live what they're doing  i was also really upset at the time about an ex who i felt had wronged me   now i never even think about this person anymore!

all of these things were at one point big important problems that i had to  analyze  to death to find a solution 

but you know what? in every single case, the ""problem"" was  solved by just moving on  i moved on to another company  moved on to another girlfriend  found a new gym  my big important problems never got ""solved"", they just sort of    faded away  they became irrelevant due to changing circumstances 

it's a comforting thought  make a list of your big important problems today and do this exercise looking five years into the past  reading old journals can be enlightening too  it's a reminder that 99  of our concerns are unimportant circumstantial stuff  stated in other terms  ""this too shall pass """

how does stoicism fit into this mind set? i have this impression that if you are dissatisfied with something and you can't come to terms with what ever you are dissatisfied with, you should pursue a better life

1,"what is the stoic's approach to stress and anxiety? hi all,

over the past year, i have been learning about stoic principles  i'm aware that adopting the various aspects of stoicism is a life long journey  

one aspect of my life that i tend not to apply it to, is my current situation  i work a full time job and am doing a part time mba program at night  

recently, i have started to feel incredibly anxious and stressed about it all  not only wanting to ensure i do well in my course, but also the stress of neglecting those around me  i feel like i do not currently have a balance between the work, school and personal life which is not very healthy  when i do hang out with friends are or my partner, i cant stop thinking about all the difficult things i have to learn for my course which gives me more anxiety  it doesnt feel nice not being present and having quality time with the people i love  

what would a stoics take be on stress and anxiety?"
1,"so my dog just got put down some backstory 
she had always been on the skinny side, however lately we noticed she was losing quite a bit of weight  she also had trouble walking up stairs and in general just very unstable on her feet, so we went to get her checked at the vet earlier today, figuring it was just some minor issues related to her sterilization a couple weeks prior  they ran a blood test and found that her kidneys were looking really bad, and told us they would need to run some more tests tomorrow  we then take her home and wait for tomorrow  a couple hours goes by and she starts shaking and wheezing  we immediately rush her to an animal hospital and get her hospitalized, and was told that the doctor would run some tests and give us an update in a couple of hours 

fast forward to the present and we just got the news that it would be best for her to sleep in  i was shocked and sad at first but quickly realized that this was an ideal opportunity to practice stoicism 

i understand that death is a part of life, and it is one of the many things that are out of our control, yet somehow i was still somewhat in control of her death, and that s what really gets to me  the fact that i had to make such a choice although i had hoped to share many more years of joy with her 

i guess what really hurt the most was my expectations and how sudden this all was  it hadn t even crossed my mind that something like this could happen when we got her  we even checked with multiple doctors regularly about her weight to make sure nothing was wrong, and to suddenly go from happy and healthy to acute kidney failure in under a week really shocked me 

not sure what my goal is in sharing this  i suppose it s a way of coping  take what you will from it

1,"watching sports as a stoic so i thought i'd write this after a particularly bad weekend for my favorite sports teams  let me begin by saying that i've played sports all my life, from baseball and cross country in my youth to now continuing to compete in marathons, bjj, and muay thai as a grown adult  but i feel like there's a lot that's been written from the athletes perspective and not much from the fans so today i'd like to explore it here  

i'm a big sports fan i watch pretty much everything and i get invested heavily in my favorite teams and fighters so when they lose i'd take pretty hard  a few years back when my favorite football team(american football) was doing surprisingly well i got so heavily invested that if they won on sunday the rest of the week i was in an incredibly pleasant mood but if they lost the whole week i felt like i just watched my dog get shot  since then i've matured more and i've started my journey down the stoic path and i've found sports are a great way to practice stoicism  

i still get heavily invested when i'm watching a game fight, it wouldn't be fun if i didn't  however when they win or lose i allow myself to feel the emotion of the game for just brief moment before i let it go  i don't spend time thinking ""man if the player had just gotten that interception"" or ""if he would've just made that field goal"" because that serve no purpose  as much as i'd like to believe that i have an effect on the outcome of the game the truth is i don't  i think being a sports fan is a great way to learn and teach life lessons in a way that ultimately doesn't harm us as fans in any way  

i don't have children yet but when i do i hope they'll sit down to watch the ball game with me so when our favorite team wins i can remind them ""fortune smiled upon us today, but don't forget you still need to finish your homework before bed"" and if they lose i can remind them that ""accept this loss and don't dwell on it, don't spend time thinking of what could have been""  

i understand that a big part of stoicism is self control over expectations but i believe it can be a great exercise to let yourself get caught up in the emotion of the game if it means that when it's over you can now practice regaining control and practice letting go of the emotion, good or bad  movies and television in general can probably be used in a similar way but the randomness of sports lends it's self better to this sort of thing in my opinion  

anyways, i don't know if something similar has been posted before i'm sorry if this is redundant  if you guys also watch sports what are some painful losses you experienced? for me the most painful loss i've watched in recent memory was the arizona cardinals losing to the panthers in the nfc championship a few years ago and just this saturday asu blowing a 14 point lead in the last two minutes of the game  i've handled the loss this saturday much better than i did az cardinals loss and it's what inspired me to write this up "

1,"a small recommendation for french people bonjour! hi!

i'm a french canadian student in philosophy and am an avid reader!  i've been dipped in the philosophy potion being 4 yo as my grand father is was a philosopher!  he was a college teacher in philosophy by the past and is now a big book store owner in quebec canada!  because of that background i've read a tremendous amount of book for somebody my age (20) and have met several ways of thinking throughout these reading!  

i'm here to recommend not only about sto cism reading but general philosophy reading since i think that stoic ways are a thing that is tremendously helpfull but cannot be without other ways of thinking, making your life yours   i stongly believe that sto cism is a way of being but it cannot be on it's own, it needs help of other philosophy to be since it's a completed incoplete way of being if you can grasp what i mean   so here are just a couple of books i stongly recommend to read for neophytes (100 200pages), andvanced readers (200 350 pages) as much as heavy lifters of books(350 pages ) 

neophytes 
""the way of the bow""   paulo cohelo (en)
""the alchemist""   paulo cohelo (en)
""le miracle spinoza""   fr deric lenoir (fr ?en?)

advanced
""ishmael  l'homme une fois disparu, y aura t il un espoir pour le gorille?""   frederic lenoir (fr ?en?)
""the fifth moutain""   paulo cohelo (fr en)

heavy weight
""cosmos""   michel onfray (fr)
""sagesse""   michel onfray (fr)


 i don't know if there's a lot of other french here but consuder reading as a proper way of learning guys, don't be shy to buy a book, higghlight it and write in it as further in your life it will make you able to retrospect on your past self and see where you came from and where you are going   it makes you also more aware of your reading and of what goes through your mind wich can be transposed to other moments in your life not only reading!  also it's a beautifull ""heritage"" (things you leave to your family once you die i'm missing a word in my vocabulary here please excuse me)  

so that's about what i had to say, i hope you can enjoy something in here and if you need more reading recomandation, feel free to hit me up, dm me or ask in comments for theme or other ways of philosophy!  or you can also enlighten me with some of your own reading discovery!

1,"positive thinking positive thinking is the art of having happy, pleasing thoughts  as if it will breed happiness  it is the neglect of one s emotions  it is also ignoring adversity  as if anything that shall happen should necessarily be a good thing  

negative thinking is the art of having sad, unpleasing thoughts  as if anything that shall happen should necessarily be a bad thing  

positive thinking promises that nothing non preferred will happen  negative thinking promises that nothing preferable will happen  

instead, we should aim to think rationally  anticipate adversity to the end that you may foresee what could occur  then, return to the present  not  dwelling  but  anticipating  the near future  

see things for what they are  expect that anything can happen  preferable or not, but lies outside the sphere of choice  none are neither good or bad, but indifferent  externals cannot harm you  the only good is moral behaviour  the only bad is immoral behaviour  

positive thinking is no good choice, and certainly not what a stoic practices  i believe i have a good understanding of positive thinking and why it should not be practiced but inform me if i made any error or something key that could have been mentioned ( "
1,"to uphold a stoic mindset is most important during the good times so ive been learning and implementing stoic teachings in my life for the past year now  the reason i got interested in stoicism was because i was having a tough time  i was going through a deep depression, my first breakup, moving away to university and then lockdown happened  through all this i slowly put myself back together through different philosophies, and stoicism was one of the most helpful 

but i think back to times in my life when times were better  i spent these times living hedonistically in every which way, using substances, binge eating, always socialising etc  now i realise it wouldve been far better to practice stoicism during these times because when the difficult times came along i would have been better prepared 

now thats not to say i regret my past  i dont dwell too much on it but i want to use it as reference for when things get easier down the road  i want to upkeep my stoic readings and thoughts during the easier times to avoid becoming complacent and to prepare for the future "
1,"my experience with the law of reversed effort (part 3) part 1    my _experience _with _the _law _of _reversed _effort  (

part 2   

i deleted the account i posted the parts above with but i am back 

i post this because i myself tend forget about how imortant the law of reversed effort is 

as a reminder, the law of reversed effort is this  the harder you try, the worse you do  or as alan watts puts it    ""when you try to stay on the surface of the water, you sink  but when you try to sink you float "" 

why do i post this? 

first, i have had great success in unknowingly using the law of reversed effort in the past  it literally changed my life at a crucial moment that defined my path 

secondly, i got very agitated during this weekend  it lead me to delete my soundcloud account as well as my youtube channel  i started feeling like my music was worthless and that nobody cared  all that is left from 10 years of music is this  video ( that i did with a friend of mine posted today  

thirdly, online classes stress me out  i can't follow them  i also have a hard time listening to the teacher and understanding the slides at the same time 

  so i did some thinking    i realize that at the end of the day, all i need is 50  to pass  i unconciously felt like if i didn't get 100  i would be a failure which is not the case at all  at this point, i am one month away from graduating and it all doesn't matter much anymore so i'll do as i did before  aim to be average even if it sounds counterintuitive  i don't quite know what to think about music though  

it's interesting because there are very motivational people out there such as david goggins  i do follow them from time to time but i end up being stressed out and don't get as much done and as well as when i'm following the law of reversed effort  so whenever you feel stressed out, agitated, things don't quite work out, don't forget about the law of reversed effort

1,"dealing with a confrontational roommate long story short, i've been dealing with a roommate who has it out for me for no reason, other then that he's an asshole  we used to get along well but he overstepped his his bounds, in which he thought he was a surrogate parent to me and felt like he could basically tell me what to do  i have dealt with that situation and since then we just don't talk to each other, or rather, he just doesn't acknowledge me anymore  i find it silly since he's a few decades older than me  its as if all the bonding we had over the past 6 or so months means nothing and he's lost all respect he had for me, all because he was out of line and thought he was my father or something 

he now slams doors and stopped any curiosity he once did in regards to being a respectful roommate  he's a very confrontational individual who, for example, if asked how he's doing by a walmart door greeter, will respond with, ""thats a personal fucking question""  i can put up with a lot of bullshit, probably too much since i absolutely hate confrontation  for the most part i can remain stoic and project the appearance of a calm demener but these situations really just stress me out  the tension thats created raises my anxiety levels, so i mostly choose to avoid it at all costs  i'm never in our room anymore unless he's gone and when i'm there there's always this anxiety about what if he comes back and i'm forced to be in his presence for just a second, still i can put up with it  its gotten worse though  i accidentally coughed while half asleep at 2 am and he gets up, walks up to my bed, leans into my face and calls me an asshole and to cover my mouth  im like uhh ok  totally unnecessary  tonight he gets up in my face about the curfew here, which i have an exemption from that i calmly explained to him  hes like we'll see about that, think your slick huh, you messed with the wrong guy  im like how am i messing with you? doesn't answer and repeats himself then stomps off  

im tired of this undeserved hostility  im a quiet, clean, respectful tennet here and his behavior is totally unwarranted  i have a really good relationship with the house manager and right now i feel confident that i can convince him to kick out this asshole  i refuse to be the one to move out and let him win, stupid pride i know  but in case nothing changes, i'd like to learn if this community has any techniques to reduce the stress from confrontations so to regulate emotions and think more logically, or if there's ways to better conduct oneself in these types of situations "

what would you want to see in an app or web app centered around stoicism?

what i want to see so far 

1  all of the primary stoicism books both with direct translations and down to earth translations  

2  videos or talks that go in depth into stoic concepts  

3  daily materials  

4  rescues for specific emotions  feeling angry? feeling sad? there's a talk lecture for that 

5  situational rescues  lost a job? dealing with existentialism? there's a talk for that  

6  an actual course that takes you from beginner to pretty well informed about stoicism "

1,"when is it time to die? seneca writes in letter 102   we must cast off the lust for life and learn that it makes no difference when you suffer what must be suffered at some time or other  what matters is how well you live, not how long  indeed, living well often depends on not living long  

while i agree and understand the point that life in itself isn t good, i m confused by his refutation of people who desire to live in bad experiences (earlier in the letter he derides the man who would live on top of a pike)  if virtue is the only good, then wouldn t we desire to continue to live in any circumstance because we can continue to be virtuous in any circumstance?"
1,"are you stoic about others not being stoic? all my life, i've had problems with being angry or depressed  other people have not been tolerant of it  they would get angry at me for being angry, which obviously did not make things better  how dare i have the nerve to not be happy  similarly, if i was depressed, nobody ever taught me to accept it    they'd either coddle me by arguing against the negative emotion or blame it on some mental disorder 

i think people need to start learning to act more like therapists  being intolerant of others' negative emotions is just as bad, if not worse, than being intolerant of your own 

how do you respond to people who are obnoxiously whiny about minor inconveniences? do you ever get angry at them for ""ruining the mood"" for yourself or others?"
1,"appreciation and gratitude stoicism says to appreciate what you have and want nothing  i find this very hard to do  here s something i wrote in my notes last night thinking about it  any thoughts on it are welcomed 

how do i appreciate all that i am and all that i have when my whole purpose is to progress in life? when i learn about and appreciate what i am i see the potential for more, the capacity to do special things and be remembered a little longer for something  i see in myself attributes and qualities that cannot be taught or bought, so i get the urge to use them for all their worth  after all, we re all here to live and die, what better to spend my time on than this purpose of accomplishing goals and achieving greatness? the ultimate purpose of it all  what else really matters? how do i feel content with what i have, when i m alive to be rid of it in place for something better? how would i be content without directly affecting my progress towards my goals in way of laziness?"
1,"any idea why i  23f  am addicted to wallowing and ruminating and how to get out of it? 
i have become so used to my negative emotions, which i ve had for so long, that i now have a very high tolerance for them  this has decreased my motivation to change 

moreover, i m starting to almost enjoy beating myself up mentally  sometimes it almost feels like i m m purposely inducing these  negative  states in myself  i think this is partially because the idea of not being self aware of my faults terrifies me and i never want to forget them so that if when someone else points them out it won t be a surprise to me  but the other maybe larger part is that i m becoming addicted to the emotional intensity, and negative emotions are as good as positive ones in satisfying that craving  

this isn t an excuse, and i know i m capable of changing, but i m finding it difficult mostly because i don t really want to stop  but part of me does  the main reason i want to stop is for the sake of others around me, and for the sake of other people s perception of me  i find myself constantly trying to understand how this behavior might come across to others and i do realize how annoying and draining it is  i do not want to be seen that way  

any advice or insight or similar experiences?"

1,"requesting thought from stoics hi, i am 22 years old  i spend most of my time working (sales), roughly 10 hours a weekday and 2 4 on weekend days  i genuinely enjoy the time i commit to my craft  most of my peers live very different lives than i do  i ve found it s hard to develop or maintain social relationships  i lease a house in a suburban area that consists of parents or their children my age that prioritize school work and late night socialization  

now, i am a diligent stoic  i unconsciously recite its wisdom  on a weekly basis, i find 1 or 2 nights i am free after work and the gym, sitting in my living room wishing for more  it leads to a spiral of negative thoughts relating to loneliness  it s this feeling of discontentment that can only be filled by deep meditative focus, or weed and sex  in my case, loneliness is a result of desire  my mind consistently wanders to wishing a woman was with me  i ve yet to decipher if it s lust or a desire to start a family  

on those 1 or 2 nights, i try to meditate in order to overcome those negative thoughts  i find myself failing more often than i d like  the plan is to just continue my night as usual by accomplishing small goals until i m tired enough to sleep  

i guess my reasoning for posting this is to ask other stoics how you fill time that you aren t doing things like work, organizing, cleaning, eating, working out, reading, etc  i would assume with social relationships, but i find no comfort in relationships other than with lovers  i know that is not  normal  but i ve yet to find a way to properly align my thoughts "

1,"should you debate friends about conspiracies? i feel that conspiracy theories are one of the most damaging things on the planet right now  the spread of disinformation is tearing us apart everywhere i look 

some of my friends and family believe in deeply bizarre conspiracies  i ve tried to debate them in a friendly manner but i never seem to make much progress with the argument  there s always another conspiracy that can back up the one we re talking about  it s time consuming and mentally draining 

sometimes i think the stoic thing to do is just to ignore it and focus on myself but that s what i was doing before and when i turned back around everyone was saying insane things  i fear that if everybody just shrugged and said  hmm i guess my friends and family are crazy now  nothing i can do,  if we wasn t looking out for our friends and having these long conversations, disinformation would spread much faster

1,"are we obliged to stay with a person that has an illness? would it be stoic if we leave our partners for that? i'm curious what the stoic community thinks about this question 

this is pretty broad and can be seen from different perspectives  an interesting variable includes the type of illness and the stage of it  examples include depression, suicidal thoughts, bipolar disorder, eating disorder, terminal cancer, reproductive problems, etc   

what would you base your answers on? if these problems are not caused by us or the person we are dating or married to, then how should we react to it? would you base your answers on love, virtues, self interest, or something else?

i personally think there is a fine line that when a stoic should stay in the relationship  as a human being, we have our limits  as a stoic, we have a mindset to do our best and perhaps surpass that limit  but there should be a time when we should not have the obligation to be with someone that has an illness  if the person is physically threatening us or anyone we know, i think that would be a red signal   if he she them start to fall into vices and influence us to do the same, then that is a signal to leave  no matter how terrible the illness is, as long as it does not affect my virtues and character, then i think it is worth to stay and help them out as much as i can  i would not worry if it cuts off all of my preferred indifferences, but as long as i remain virtuous in a relationship that includes an illness, then i am there to stay 

that is my view about this topic at this moment, but i would like to receive the insights of my fellow stoics from this subreddit  feel free to add other elements i may have not mentioned "
1,"lost in what to follow for principles in life  hello to you all,

i am having a real  dilemma in life and trying to priorities my life since now i am going to be a father soon  i have been raised as a buddhist for a number of years before i lost interest in it thinking that the philosophy is only about ""me"" and not about ""us""  since then, i have been following books such as think and grow rich, awaken the giant within and many of these so called ""american"" books and the law of attraction and all that kind of stuff  it has helped me in life so far but now i feel like since i have been reading stoic books, i have felt very conflicted with all the self help improvement genre  i find that self help is so much bs compared to stoic books  i find that when i practiced stocism, i felt so much at ease about life and in a way enjoying life more  however, i want to achieve big things in life and feel like that is where stoicism doesn't recognise about achieving financial freedom, travelling the world and more  since i am going to be a father soon, i really need to priorities my life and philosophy  do i choose stoicism and life a tranquile life or do i follow these crazy self help american books that basically tell you that you are never perfect and should work on your life  it seems like recently i have been having an internal battle in my mind  i am lost

1,"just started journaling hi! 

i bought the daily stoic book with the 366 stoic meditations by ryan holiday  along with it i m reading another stoic book (my 3rd one) 

the book encourages journaling and i started to do it using a software called obsidian with daily notes  i write the phrase of the day, my interpretation and analysis of the history ryan gives, a morning and night reflections where i try to see how today s meditation and history can change how i see the world and how i see myself in it with my experiences of the day 

reflecting and thinking this way has proven to be highly beneficial, and i have just started it  the first day was really simple, but the more you do it, the more complex it becomes and you develop your own system  your mind will take you to a lot of places and you will connect a lot of the dots with others areas of your life  you will connect stoicism to places you forgot needed to be addressed 

i want to recommend you to start journaling so you can put yourself, your actions, beliefs and thoughts on paper or whatever you use to write, and start attacking all this things with this philosophy  it s like with journaling you are a sculptor of your mind and you are sculpting a better version of yourself everyday

now, even speaking from a rational perspective, that would make sense because anger stops us from thinking and behaving positively  i also believe that 

so what is the dilemma here?

well, here s the thing, i have always hated people who hurt and discriminate people weaker than them  wife beaters, bullies and asshole bosses  

just the other day, one of my female friends was assaulted by her boyfriend so badly that she was in tears and i could see a big scar on her face  i m not kidding, i was enraged for the whole day, my entire day was spent just wanting to go to her boyfriends house and giving him a taste of his own medicine 

my blood literally boils every time i hear or see such an incident and i wanna go berserk on the oppressor  it doesn t matter if it s a stranger or not 

besides, why shouldn t i feel anger at them? do i just act calm and pretend that nothing happened? it s almost impossible 

if i stop feeling anger at that, i would eventually also stop feeling sympathy for the oppressed and a strong desire for justice against oppressors 

so on one hand, i think anger is bad and on the other hand, i think it s totally justified

for starters, the whole wedding was sorta last minute, as i only had one month to prepare  i decided to do it because i prided myself in my public speaking skills, i could save my cousin a good chunk of money, and i could also add an personal touch to the ceremony that a minister wouldn't necessarily have, as i know my cousin and his fianc  much better than they theoretically would  i knew that i would have to deliver a level of emotion that many family members on both sides of the aisle built up in the 6 year relationship the bride and groom maintained  

instead of giving in to covid fears, i went and got tested before we attended, as did my family members  all came back negative  i asked my cousin to ask his fian e's family to get tested, or quarantine accordingly before the wedding, so as to not create a superspreader event  some tested, some didn't  i did my best to make sure we were safe, and i let out a sigh of relief a few days ago when i tested negative once more  i was able to calm my nerves by planning ahead of time  

the church that i got ordained with online had sent me a script of what to say, however there was no real explanation on where to pause for effect or emphasize certain phrases  so, for every night for a month, i re wrote the script in a handheld notebook which i was preparing to read from on the day of the event  i was formerly in band throughout high school and took an advanced theater class in college, so with that knowledge, i was able to write down certain articulations in the script using symbols i learned in band, and got into character before the wedding using the techniques i learned in theater  i was giving a performance, after all 

my cousin also asked me to say something about his father who had passed away three years ago  clearly, it was a highly emotional event for him, and i was faced with an even bigger duty  however, instead of being overwhelmed with the task of speaking on behalf of a loved one who we wished could have been there, i did some emotional planning  

i spent long nights thinking about my uncle, and what he meant to my cousin  one night, i casually asked his brother over some video games about what they used to do together as father and son, secretly taking notes on my phone while he was telling me about it  i wanted to paint a picture for the audience of what this man was like  as i was doing homework one night, i was thinking about my days in high school and then    boom it hit me  i remember that i sat next to my uncle at my cousin's high school graduation  if there were an image i needed to plant in the minds of my audience, it would be that of an extremely proud father watching his firstborn wave to him as he walked by in his cap and gown  i was happy and sad at this nostalgic memory, and i even let myself cry before writing it down in my forward to the script  

i was preparing myself in that month by listening to music, playing epic video games, and watching the episode of friends where joey weds monica and chandler  i read my notebook while i was eating breakfast and before i went to bed  i spent a lot basically becoming numb to the emotional 25 minute speech i was preparing to give  when the day came, everybody was anxious but me  i knew what i had to do, and how to do it     the only time i let myself get taken back was when the music started and i got to see my cousin's fianc  walk down the aisle with her father  i wiped a tear away, a gave the best public speech of my life so far  

i started off talking about my cousin's father to hit everybody in the feels right away  at the end of that remembrance, i lowered my book and stressed how much my uncle would have loved to see this ceremony  after a quick comic relief, i cracked a smile on everybody's faces and began the wedding  i had read the script over a hundred times, easily    i'll tell you this about that experience  it is such a powerful sight when you look around and realize that you made 20 people ball their eyes out at the emotional rollercoaster that you delivered  

i pronounced them husband and wife, slammed the book shut and directed the attention straight to my cousin and his new wife, so as to hand the applause of my performance straight to them  it was an amazing feeling, and even though i stayed humble when i was being praised afterwards, i can honestly say i'm very proud of myself for stoically holding it together long enough to make an amazing memory for everybody  

i also got very drunk afterwards because i was emotionally drained! but it was a fun time, and i can sleep happily knowing i did that

1,failing at things in my control today i failed at something completely in my control  how would a stoic respond to himself failing things he can control?
1,"would you like to know what the actual difference between yourself and the gods will be? they will exist for longer   and yet to me what an indisputable mark it is of a great artist to have captured everything in a tiny compass  a wise man has as much scope before him as a god with all eternity in front of him  there is one thing, too, in which the wise man actually surpasses any god  a god has nature to think for his immunity from fear, while the wise man can thank his own efforts for this  look at that for an achievement, to have all the frailty of a human being and all the freedom from care of a god  philosophy s power to blunt all the blows of circumstance is beyond belief  never a missile lodges in her  she has strong, impenetrable defenses  some blows she breaks the force of, parrying them with the slack of her gown as if they were trivial, others she flings off and hurls back at the sender

1,what do you think are some aspects of stoicism that will help deeper my understanding of epicureanism? as they are more alike than they are different 
1,"something buddhists and stoics can agree on, it is what you make it  "
1,"don t think that your life is met with misfortune that surpasses the lives of others  fortune brings preferred and non preferred ends to all  we are all faces with challenges  need you not, though, to take this seriously  nature tests all human beings of their strength thus, revealing one s character 

some people think that their life is just a horrible misfortune  they feel as though the whole world is fine  that only they suffer  or, at least, that they suffer much more than the rest  

the truth is, we are all going through adversity  this is inevitable  this is life  this does not mean, though, that we must therefore complain and lament  

stoicism is about facing adversity with courage  not letting yourself be disturbed by these non preferred indifferences  realise that the only power you possess is over yourself   your will is your own  choose, then, how you shall use this faculty "
1,"the view from above (marcus aurelius)     pale blue dot (carl sagan)  

  from marcus aurelius   

constantly reflect on how swiftly all that exists and is coming to be is swept past us and disappears from sight  for substance is like a river in perpetual flow, and its activities are ever changing, and its causes infinite in their variations, and hardly anything at all stands still  and ever at our side is the immeasurable span of the past and the yawning gulf of the future, into which all things vanish away  then how is he not a fool who in the midst of all this is puffed up with pride, or tormented, or bewails his lot as though his troubles will endure for any great while? (5 23)

think of substance in its entirety, of which you have the smallest of shares  and of time in its entirety, of which a brief and momentary span has been assigned to you  and of the works of destiny, and how very small is your part in them  (5 24)

for all things are swift to fade and become mere matter for tales, and swiftly too complete oblivion covers their every trace  and here i am speaking of those who shone forth with wonderful brightness  as for all the rest, the moment that they breathed their last, they were out of sight, out of mind  and what does it amount to, in any case, everlasting remembrance? sheer vanity and nothing more  what, then, is worthy of our striving? this alone, a mind governed by justice, deeds directed to the common good, words that never lie, and a disposition that welcomes all that happens, as necessary, as familiar, as flowing from the same kind of origin and spring  (4 33)

 amp  x200b 

  from carl sagan   

look again at that dot  that's here  that's home  that's us  on it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives  the aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every ""superstar,"" every ""supreme leader,"" every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there  on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam 

the earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena  think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot  think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds 

our posturings, our imagined self importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe, are challenged by this point of pale light  our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark  in our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves 

the earth is the only world known so far to harbor life  there is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate  visit, yes  settle, not yet  like it or not, for the moment the earth is where we make our stand 

it has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character building experience  there is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world  to me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known "

1,"responding poorly to life's current challenges about a year ago i considered myself a good practicing stoic  the challenges i experienced then weren't easy necessary but i felt equipped to deal with them  

now life brings new challenges with the shutdown abd everything else going on in the world  honestly, i've resorted to drinking smoking weed to get through the isolation  the last few days i've done nothing productive save from feeding myself  

i've tried quitting but i find so little joy in current life that the boredom always sucks me back in  i'm not even sure why i'm posting this  i guess i need to get back to reading the basic stoic texts, it's been a minute since i've read those  it's hard to reframe the isolation as a positive  i know my emotions are a result of my perception, not circumstances, but still it's really hard to ""love thy fate"" right about now"

1,"stoici technics to deal wuth concentration  since the last year i found myself in love for a wonderful woman  she ia awesome, interesting, smart and beautiful by every means i could expect, and fortunately for me she is in love with me too  i am pretty happy about how our relationship has become stronger and stronger, but i also noticed that it came with a problem  i've been getting more and more distracted  i can't keep 10 minutes without thinking about her  sometimes i remember our moments together, sometimes i imagine little surprises to do to her, sometimes i imagine possible scenarios in the future  i've been noticing that it makes me lose too much time every day  literally everything i do reminds me of her and makes me stop to think about her  i might spend hours per day like that  even the ordinary paths i take in the streets are now taking more time because i'm too distracted while walking  i fell in love other times in the past, but never like that, even when i was a teenager, less experienced and more emotional  i imagine that in a long term it will pass naturally, but i am afraid that my current situation might drag me away from my positive habits  this quarantine allowed me to reset my life, but in the last 2 months i'm feeling i'm losing my good routines because everything takes too much time and gives me laziness  it is as if the fact that simply by thinking on her, my brain got more dopamine  

i know that it is ""stoically"" wrong by its literature and the rational side of me says that i have to do something  i but i don't know what to do  i wanna know if someone ever felt like that and or is someone knows something practically to prevent myself of get lost in my imagination like that "

1,"a fine piece of stoic wisdom    from epicurus himself!

by pleasure we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble in the soul  it is not an unbroken succession of drinking bouts and of merrymaking, not sexual love, not the enjoyment of the fish and other delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life  it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest disturbances take possession of the soul     for this reason prudence is a more precious thing even than the other virtues, for a life of pleasure which is not also a life of prudence, honor, and justice  nor lead a life of prudence, honor, and justice, which is not also a life of pleasure  for the virtues have grown into one with a pleasant life, and a pleasant life is inseparable from them "
1,"need serious help! i'm paranoid (physical pain too) hey, 

if you reading this kindly bare with me i don't know how long this post is gonna be ,but i will summarise a tl dr section, somehow  


so i'm a 21 year old musician  i just realised and felt paranoia at its worst  

the back story of why i'm being paranoid, 

there is this guy probably 5 years older than me, he used to live in my old appartment building he was in 1st floor and i was in second floor, and that guy happens to also be friends with a guy who bullied me  i didn't know about that until a year of knowing him and after i knew he was friends with a guy who hit me when i was 15 i never spoke to him after wards and it wasn't the only reason to stay away from him he was such a pot head and goofy class a pervert and nobody in the appartment building likes him and anyone who sees him first will try to stay away from him, now that i explained who he is  let me tell what he did to me  

on october 19th last month he just texted me out of nowhere asking my new home address   i was confused for a moment because i told him a year ago when i was vacating my old home as a sense of respect, and also he was like my neighbour and it would be rude to say not to  so with that said i was so confused because he didn't tell me why he wanted my address and after asking a few times he said something stupid that didn't make any sense, also he was very specific and asked me to send my current location i was overly confused by this time because i haven't seen or talked to this guy in a year  

ok so what does this have to do with me being paranoid right? let me explain you guys remember that he was friends with the guy who bullied me, and you guys remember that i won't talk to him that much well i made that very apparent and transparent with him, that he too knows that i hated him and that i wanted him to know about that 

ok with that being said, i thought that he was plotting to beat me along side the bullies he was friends with  i know this isn't true and he doesn't have that big of brain or a solid vengeance over me to do so, but my mind kept on building these stories, this type of imaginary scenarios happen in my mind since i was a child, for example i had a constant recurring thought that i was fuckin my maths teacher like when i was 10 or something at that point i won't be stimulated by lust so my maths teacher kissing me was a nightmare to me and i couldn't able to control that type of a thought for like weeks it will come in my dreams when i'm watching tv it will even bypass and flash as i'm deeply involved in someother stuffs like studies and as i aged some real life problems made me think that way and it will stay on my head for weeks or even months  

ok so back to the current paranoia i'm dealing with , i'm paranoid since i received that text from him and it's slowly growing and growing and after a few days after that text my stomach(abdomen,i guess) started to like arrested and stuns my physical movements and slows down my work  it's not necessarily pain but it's something you feel when you are suddenly so afraid of something like when you see a ghost or something but for me this arrested thing is staying with me for a week now and it's slowly becoming painful  and it increase in arresting sensation when i ever i get paranoid over the thought i mentioned and for the past two days it got even worse i couldn't fall asleep i wanted to kill that guy or break his bones for destroying my peace by landing a text asking my personal info by being creepy  but he hasn't done any physical harm to me (also he can't if he wanted to) or talked to me in a threatening way all he did was sending a single sentence of text that involed my personal information and now i'm paranoid over that  

also i can't blame him cuz he just sent me a text and did nothing else, but my mind is like sub consiously belived that he is trying to whoop me up, i keep on saying it to myself but sub consiously that thought is haunting me  

the thing i'm experiencing is clearly paranoia and this is the first experience where i'm feeling physical discomfort for like a week over something that has like 0 1  percentage chance of happening  and also this is the first time i'm being affected by a external human's actions, and that pissees me off  i even thought that i might be like a real crazy person because if this happened another person he won't be paranoid like me

so how should i deal with this, my work life is also affected in a way 

tl dr

for those skimming 

im so paranoid over something that has like 0 1  chance of happening  

paranoid symptoms  

arrested stomach or abdomen
can't move freely as i used to before
paranoid thoughts poppin in the middle of the work and when sleeping 

having these symptoms for a week as it was slowly building and still having now as i type and also today its a little bare able 

also this is my first ever physical discomfort i'm facing tho have faced paranoia before as a child 

thanks and someone plse help me, and how do stoics deal with paranoia this severe, and has anyone felt paranoia over some others actions? 

this is something i can't control meditation doesn't help cuz this weight in my stomach is too heavy 

please help me "
1,you can t control what the world does    
1,do you think it's right as a stoic to stand up for yourself if people are taking the piss out of you? 
1,"which book to start as a beginner i recently purchased 3 books from the great stoics  
meditations by marcus aurelius
discourses and selected writings by epictetus
letters to a stoic by seneca

i started reading seneca first because it was the first one that came in, i didn't get too far and i do enjoy it but it doesn't seem to be sinking in as easily  basically the question is should i continue with seneca or maybe move to epictetus or marcus? just to be sure i can get my brain ready to understand the more challenging writings "
1,"prety new to stoicism  help with pre emotions as far as i've been able to glean, stoicism differentiates between the initial involuntary physical flash of emotion and your experience when you consciously interact with those physical feelings  i am doing a lot better with the latter part  reminding myself that just because i feel panic that i don't need to feel fear for the future  

the part i'm struggling with  ""therefore, when some terrifying sound comes or something else of the same sort happens, the mind of even the wise man cannot help but be disturbed, and shrink, and grow pale for a moment, not from any anticipation of some evil, but because of certain swift and unconsidered motions which forestall the action of the intellect and the reason      ""   epictetus

in the moment, when struggling with those physical sensations, what do you do? for example, if i am at work and something suddenly reminds me of an adverse past event and i feel like i can't breathe or i cry, how do i simply continue to do my job? i can intellectually understand that these events were in the past, but my body isn't so sure about it, and it's very difficult to do my job while struggling with those physical sensations (for some reason customers don't enjoy when you cry )

it seems like the stoics find practice to be the best remedy for this, but although in some situations and with work, the panic has diminished, in others, the chemicals flooding through my brain and body seem as undiminished as ever  

at home, it is easier to accept that these things occur and ride it out, but it interferes with work and school  what is a stoic way to handle it?"
1,"is stoicism compatible with worldly goals? some historical stoic figures (marcus aurelius, seneca) had important responsibilities in goverment, great wealth etc  today, stoicism seems to be popular among some succesful entrepreneurs, influencers etc 

at the same time epictetus said that if, besides aiming for inner goals (such as serenity no matter what happens) we also aim at outer goals like power and riches, than we will probably not gain the latter   and certainly not the former  

what do you think and what is your experience?"
1,"stoicism for a better life   weekly exercise (november 4) hello there, 

for this week s exercise, let us find some inspiration from an often overlooked stoic teacher gaius musonius rufus  this is from the translated fragments by cynthia king    stobaeus 3 1 48    3 1  77  chapter 1  about virtue    

 gt ""it is not possible to live well today unless you treat it as your last day ""  

little known fact, musonius rufus was epictetus' teacher, and he was so revered for his knowledge of philosophy that he has been called the socrates of rome  personally, i believe socrates was so unique that there could never be a socrates of ""xyz""  i mean his impact on philosophy was so significant that we even split philosophy into pre and post socratic eras  however, this does not take away from musonius rufus's insights into life, philosophy and impact on posterity starting with his stoic students (or prokoptons) 

i chose this quote above because this cuts to the heart of the stoic philosophy  a cornerstone of this school of thought is always trying to be aware of the immanence of death  our impermanence is a reality that we tend to ignore all too often, and this ignorance is directly responsible for a detrimental paradigm shift that our ancient guides constantly warns us against 

our lives are short  we can exit this temporal existence at any time  so we must try and accomplish our goals right now  and what are these goals? being virtuous and always working towards the betterment of humanity    so as a practical exercise this week, focus your energies in each moment   in each act   in each conversation as if it is your last one    you will find that at the end of the day as you reflect on your efforts, you will find a sense of peaceful pride and tranquillity as it relates to your efforts 

let me know how you felt, and whether treating each moment as the last one gave you a sense of peace and tranquillity in your efforts  this exercise really can help you find that inner tranquillity with indifference to externals

1,"is it ok for couples to swear or name call when fighting? for me, the most important foundation of a relationship is respect, so i want a relationship where even when we fight, we don t swear or call things name 

but i am open to perspective, and i wrote in this sub because i think this can offer me more wisdom than posting on r relationship_advice  

my boyfriend has temper problems  i ve tried and been trying for him to see my point of not swearing or name calling, but he still does it  his own side is because i pushed him, and if i don t push him, he won t swear 

the reason this time why i pushed him was rather ridiculous  maybe, i am at fault here  

so, we both agreed a year ago that we wouldn t talk about his ex anymore  however, he talked about her 2 nights ago that she broke his laptop, and she actually still has to pay him  take note that they haven t talked for 3 years now, because that s how long we ve been together  

so, my jealousy or curiosity kicked in  i asked him if he was happy that they broke up  he said he couldn t really say it  i got hurt  i asked him why  and he just said well, at the time it was the best decision  

but i was still hurt, because it made me feel he doesn t love me  so i asked him again the same question i asked him a year ago, who he really loves  and he got angry and said,  holy shit  this is so fucking annoying  how many times do i have to fucking tell you the same answer? stop asking me these idiotic questions  

and i explained to him that his not saying clearly whether he was happy or not that they broke up created doubts in my head again about his feeling  

he responded that he was just thinking what would it be like if they didn t break up  again that fucking hurt me, so i asked him why would he think that way? he said because it would give him a different future  a bad or a good one  but knowing how they ended, he thought it would be a bad future and anyway it was over that he didn t love him nor wanted to be with her anymore 

but my doubts are messing up my mind  (

but anyway, so i told him to stop swearing then or call things name (idiotic questions)  he said i shouldn t push him, and he will have motivation to actually change that because he said i was not doing my effort also to change on not pushing him 

and i was just thinking in my head that it s not that i push him, but he clearly has problems managing his temper which we both know 

he also told me i was so full of myself and i should get over it (this is name calling too, is it not?) and said cancer whore (not to me, but his expression when he gets mad in his own language)  i still called him out on it and he said i should stop overreacting because he didn t say to me but more like saying,  fuck! 

so, is it okay for couples to fight with swearing? name calling? i told him so many times not to do these things   ( but maybe i also have fault cause i push him by asking the same questions "

1,"on the easy way out ralph waldo emerson once wrote  i hate quotation  tell me what you know   and yes, the irony that i m quoting him isn t lost on me, but hear me out!  

emerson was referring to people s tendency to just regurgitate only what they d heard when faced with a thought provoking question  hearing this made me think of all the times when i d go  oh well this stoic an old professor my grandpa said      whenever asked a question  honestly, that can be just an easy way out of thinking or acting  repeating only what we ve read, but not expanding with personal insight   

i m still fairly new to practicing stoicism, so perhaps this exercise won t fully fit here  this week try to not react to a question or issue with only a quote in mind, but strive to think of your own take on it  my personal goal is to not try to take the easy way out  to actually put forth effort to a solution  maybe this helps someone, but in any case, thanks for hearing me out "
1,"is there such a thing as safety? and would a stoic strive for such a thing? i just watched that video of the dude playing the piano during a protest turned violent, and surprisingly the majority of the top comments were all people saying that he should be focused on leaving the scene rather than playing the piano  obviously one could say that it would be the ""safe"" move to leave a violent scene, but it kind of bothered me  

in the video the man was never once harmed by anyone and just kept playing along as the situation unfolded  so, what if he were to leave the scene instead  amp  somehow ended up getting caught up in the violence? everyone in the comments was so focused on safety but i feel like that goes against the point of stoicism  

we literally cannot control anything other than our own actions and safety is never guaranteed  driving your car is one of the most dangerous things in the world but you don't see people complaining about how unsafe it is on a regular basis  so is there even such a thing as safety? i thought the point of stoicism was to do what you feel is right to yourself and whatever fate lies ahead is unchangeable  therefore you cannot be worried about safety because it is something you can't control  you can certainly avoid doing stupid things, but who's to say that doing the ""safe"" thing rather than the ""stupid"" thing is any less likely to cause you harm? i think that video represented stoicism incredibly well (unless i just don't understand it) because while chaos was unfolding all around the man, he peacefully minded his own business and kept on playing the piano because he wanted to  our world is entirely chaotic whether you'd like to admit it or not, and to me there is only relatively safety yet it's just a fleeting sense of security in reality  so i guess i'm just left wondering if safety is real and or could safety even be something that stoics try to strive for? 

tldr  people wouldn't stop complaining about the dude playing piano because it wasn't the smart or safe decision when in reality safety isn't necessarily real, it's just a false sense of security that we like to give ourselves  

however if you have another viewpoint i'm genuinely curious about this topic and i'm by no means saying i'm right  i would love for someone to provide me with more information or another point of view!"
1," equanimity is achieved through tattoos, calendars, and references to popular culture  think of stoicism as a brand     musonius rufus this is personally one of my favorite quotes by rufus  it really encapsulates the idea of stoicism not being a haughty, pedantic philosophy but rather a quirky, superficial fandom  frankly, people should spend less time reading the original cannon and spend more time pursuing what stoicism means to them and how it can be propagated to the wider public

1,"accepting what is, the struggle of learning to love fate dear friends,

i have studied most of the basic stoic texts and tried living according to them for some time now, but i struggle with applying the concept of amor fati 

in order to achieve ataraxia, you have to master the dichotomy of control, which means that we should accept anything that is outside of our control  this is an 'easy' concept to accept, because we can't change fate, so why would we resist it? however, my struggle lies in taking this to the next level, from simply accepting fate, to loving it 

 enchiridion 8, translation unknown  ""don't seek for everything to happen as you wish it would, but rather wish that everything happens as it actually will, then your life will flow well""  and more of these like the discourses 4 1 89 and 1 6 1

i understand the usefullnes of loving everything that happens, if you love whatever happens you are invulnerable  your tranquilitty can not be shaken because nothing unwilling happens 

  but how does one go from accepting fate, to loving it?   how can you turn the most horrible of lifes events as something to be wished? i recently lost someone close to me, and it have accepted this, but how could you possibly rationalize loving these things 

am i interpreting this incorrectly? does the change from acceptance to loving of fate happens after years of practice? is there any reasoning behind this except for 'it usefull'? any other quotes or letter dealing with this very issue? i'd look to hear your approaches to this

i became a lead aerospace welder, welding engine parts for mostly the f 35 fighter jet 
i finally started making money trading while welding  
tried my hardest to be a bodybuilder as well 

i did this for a little over a year and it was incredible  but twards the end of that year i was so burnt out i stopped trading, lifting, and quit my welding job due to the fact that i was making awesome money from trading consistently  for a couple weeks after i quit i didnt do anything  laid around sleeping  then i picked up trading again when i remembered thats why i quit my welding job  

i snappedy achilles in half helping puch a car then 4 days later i was diagnosed with epilepsy (again) with 15 partial seizures per day  (its ""better"" now) 

i lost my stoic mindset  my work ethic, and my ability to continue to improve my day trading skills  its been 10 months and everyday i try to become stoic again, improve my trading skills (because i make like  100 a day and im struggling to maintain that)  but i never stick to it or take it seriously  i just need to stop being a lazy bum  

i fell into the victim mentality (embarrassingly)

anyway any advice to get past this? move locations? new environment? go back to welding to gain motivation again? i even thought about paying someone to watch over me for a week to keep me on track until  to get it through my head that its the life i want so do what needs to be done  im not happy with this mindset and im lost lol

1,"yet another memento mori calendar hi guys,

i have been seeing these posts about memento mori calendars lately which were a lot of fun and an interesting idea  i wanted one where important life events can be shown in a different color on the calendar but couldn't find anything that met my needs, so i went and did it myself! credit to  u ender_guardian for posting the one that i based this on (in  this ( thread) 



there are 2 sheets  the calendar itself, and an important dates sheet where you add the date and color you would like those events to show up as  in order to use it, you'll want to change the birthdate at the top of the calendar tab to your own (give it a minute after doing this, it takes time for everything to recalculate) and add your events to the important dates tab  there are a couple of example dates added already 

a few notes 

  each dot isn't exactly 1 week  there are 52 rows for each year, 1 per week, which leaves 1 extra day (2 on leap years)  those extra days get lumped into the last week of the year  1 column   exactly 1 year

  if you enter 2 important dates that fall on the same week, the color of the one highest on the list will take precedence

  i only added a few colors  it seems that conditional formatting in google sheets won't allow for dynamic color based on what you enter into a cell which was my original plan  more colors could be added, if someone is interested just ask and i'll post what you'd need to change in order to do that

  i really wanted to be able to hover over a cell and see what event happened on that date, but again this is apparently a feature that google sheets doesn't have 

  i also wanted to add the ability to enter date ranges (so, for example, your entire tenure at a job could be a block of one color) which i'm sure google sheets can handle, but i'm having trouble coming up with a way to do it that isn't a giant clusterfuck  a workable hack would be to enter a separate row for each week of the event that you want to show 

  there's a hidden calculations tab, and i also protected most of the cells that shouldn't be changed  all of this can be overridden and the protection is mostly just warnings, not a hard stop  my goal was to make it simple to use and hard to accidentally break "

she concluded that i can boring and that she needed to sleep because she starts school at 6am tomorrow  even though that s true that she must sleep somewhat early   i wondered if it was her way to escape the boredom of talking to me   i feel upset because it s clear that she lacks interest in what i say  i do not expect her to like the subjects i enjoy nor those i speak about  yet, she lacks interest in nearly anything i say  for the past couple of times i have seen that sometimes she has no interest in the topics i speak about  so, i note it so that i shall not talk about it again  hence, when i suspected she lack of interest in what i was saying today, to which i suddenly halted,  i told her that i shall not bother to change subjects, but rather asked her what she would like to talk about  yet, she didn t bring anything up  at the end, she explained that there s nothing wrong with me, that i should be myself, only that sometimes she isn t interested in what i say (in truth, it s more than sometimes actually ) i do not expect her to like everything i talk about   for that is impossible  also, i m glad that i am aware of the fact that she got bored of the topic i was talking about so that i know not to speak it again, else o would talk about the same topics which she dislikes and now have a clue about it s to me, though, she should at least listen to me  i have defined a best friend, in a way, that is somebody who you can talk to (nearly) anything about  and, as a best friend, they would at least listen and show respect  i m not happy about this   she would at least have some idea that i m not happy  

this event only took place just then  i m unsure where to go from here, as in, should i just move on without making it a deal? or, should we have a proper conversation about this so i can clearly state how unhappy i am about this  is she really doing anything wrong also? any advice would be greatly appreciated "

1,"a striving stoic who ""must"" lie in his daily life it seems that i can't get over the hump of lying  as a once religious muslim who is striving to better himself through stoicism i find it very difficult to tell the truth regardless of the situation  i have 3 examples i'd like to give and would like them to be examined and maybe justified or outright being acts of vice 

1) i lie to my family and extended family on a daily by them believing that i am a practising muslim  as progressive as they are, i believe some wouldn't be able to handle the truth and i fear being disowned  so i proceed with putting on the image of a practising muslim  

2) i lie to my sucidual and clinically depressed ex girlfriend, i lie and say i have not been with other women  to spare her feelings and make sure she is okay  seeing as i am the only stable individual in her life that deeply cares and loves her  (i have made a commitment to tell her i'm a few days regardless of what may happen) 

3) i live in a sea country and lied to the police about my passport getting stolen  i did this to get a police report and get a new passport  i actually lost it, and getting a police report that way would take a lot of time and may not even work then  

are these excuses valid  i would rather stay truthful all the time  however, certain situations seem to be impossible to solve with truth  i would like some guidance on regards to being truthful for these situations 

and thank you in advance "
1,"timshel  thou mayest has anyone ever read john steinbeck's ""east of eden?""  

i was forced to read it in college and it quickly became my favorite book of all time, and this was before i became familiar with stoicism (though i had unknowingly been practicing a version of it for my entire life)  i decided to dust off my copy of the book and give it another read    

this book contains a profound conversation between an irish and chinese immigrant, bother highly intelligent  they discuss the bible, more specifically the story of cain and able  the chinese immigrant, lee, points out that the translation from hebrew to english has perverted the meaning of the story    

the hebrew word, timshel, had been mistranslated according to lee  he argues that the word, which translated to thou shalt in the king james bible and used in the context of conquering sin, really meant thou mayest    

so, according to lee, the original intent of this passage was thou mayest conquer over sin  that man has a choice over what his fate is and how he reacts to reality  this has had a profound effect on who i am as a person, and i thought it might be interesting to share with the group  we all have the opportunity to choose who we are and what decisions we make   

(mods, i'd love a timshel flair  i'm not a tattoo guy, though if i was, timshel would be my choice  reddit flair is my only other option )

timshel, ladies and gentleman  with the continuing instability that covid has created and the instability that looms over the us presidential election, please stay safe "

1,"what are we in control of? and how do we deal with the things we can't control? as far as i understand it, stoicism is about focusing on the things we can control, and ignoring the things we can't  seems simple enough as an idea, but i'm not sure how to put it into practice 

how exactly do we determine the things we can control, for example? is it if we can see results for it? so if we work hard at something and nothing comes from it, does that mean we should give it up?

and what about the things we can't control, how do we deal with those? like if i'm worried about getting sick from covid, i probably shouldn't just ignore that  i should research more about it right? see what the experts say i should do to prevent that  but then i could end up spiraling into researching that topic for days on end  i'm not sure where to draw the line, exactly

1,"be kind to yourself i stumbled across a concept this morning called 'self compassion' that i think might actually be really useful for others here  you can find a video by the psychologist who's done the leading research on it  here ( 

the idea is that when you suffer or when you fail, show yourself the same compassion that you would show to a close friend  abstain from leveling a judgment against yourself  instead of berating yourself, offer support, ask   yourself   what you can do to help 

you're often your own worst critic, which means you risk getting yourself down and getting in your own way  recognize that you will fail a few times at anything you try  accept that that's okay! that's part of the process  give yourself the support you need to forgive yourself and start back up again!

much of stoicism is about managing your reactions to external events in an emotionally healthy way  and self compassion seems like another route to doing that  when your child is throwing a tantrum in public and you can't calm them down, show yourself some sympathy for a frustrating situation  commend yourself for keeping your cool as well as you have so far, and accept that this is pretty uncomfortable  give yourself the support a friend would offer in these challenging situations 

and even when you fail, there's no need to dwell on how you failed in your journal at the end of the day  acknowledge that it happened, but beware of ruminating  say what you would say to a struggling friend  externalize the problem  think about it like an outsider peering in  take the role of that friend who always knows just what to say  what words of support might they offer? what advice might they give?

this isn't an excuse to let yourself do whatever you want  it's a way to avoid being unrealistically hard on yourself  it's a way to keep yourself from getting discouraged  what the stoics outlined is a way of thinking that   to fully adopt all of a sudden   would be like running a marathon without any training  so consider the merits of being your own encouraging workout buddy, rather than an austere trainer "
1,"wanting to be more stoic about dating (and hopefully indifferent) i'm ready to give up on relationships, and pursue other things in life 

the problem is, when i want to give up, emotionally i feel sad, frustrated, and angry  i just want to not care anymore  

whenever a girl compliments me, or says something nice to me, i get a little too infatuated, and think they might be interested in me, and try to get their number, only to get a ""i'll be back"", and to never connect  i know they did not intend to hurt me, but i still receive it as pain 

i do not want to pursue love anymore, as it always hurts to be lonely and to see someone else with someone  i want to truly not care anymore  i believe stoicism is the first step because the rejection, infatuation, feelings of loneliness, dating frustrations, being led on, still hurts and i want it to not hurt me anymore "

1,"a formula for putting stoic meaning into your memento mori calendar    here ( is an article by william irvine titled ""the stoic formula for a good life "" he explains from a stoic point of view why we can live a better life if we occasionally remind ourselves that our time to be alive is finite

1,"how to overcome visceral urges? so recently i've noticed one thing, maybe it's because of my age group that people act like this ( early 20s), that whenever a mutual friend isn't present people start slandering him her, it might not be malevolent and just banter but still obviously very unstoic, and as people trying to embrace stoicism we should rise above right? 

i find myself joining the slandering by contributing jokes even know i know i shouldn't, i feel the concept of "" group think"" applies here, everyone making jokes about someone who isn't there, i try to divert by saying "" yeah but he's a nice guy"", people say "" yeah ofcourse"" and then begin their jokes again, and i find myself contributing, a friend of mine said everyone does this and it's human but for sure this has to be avoided right? it would be so classy to be able to not indulge in these acts which are being performed by others who know not better  

what advice do you have for me and for this situation? surely it's not okay to do this? how can i stay strong and have control over myself in these situations?"

1,"beginner question  dealing with horrors, how to think about it? good morning everyone (  i'm only at the outset of my private stoicism study, and a question came to my mind today while reading enchiridion  perhaps people more experiences could provide some clues as how to think about the follow from a stoic perspective, preferably with some pointers to source material to study 

in 2011 a terrorist named anders behring breivik bombed out government offices and shot 69 teenagers at a summer camp outside oslo  beyond a national trauma, my partner worked at a hospital that received these brutally traumatised patients as they were coming in that night, so the stories became vivid and close  i was also walking near the site the bomb went off, and saw the fires and devastation  at night we did not know how many people had been shot at the camp  

the morning after i remember crying when i saw the number in the newspapers, and numbing up 

at the time i developed a great anger for the man who did it  i have only felt true hate two people in life  a kid who bullied me in school, and the terrorist breivik  the hate for breivik i've come to appreciate as good  it has not fuelled a need for revenge etc , but serves as a truly powerful reminder of what  his  philosophy means in practice 

i wonder now the stoic perspective on this ""useful hatred"", or my emotional reaction to seeing the body count the day after the attack? it seems to me my hatred for breivik is valuable, but perhaps a dangerous friend to hold close  opposite to this, it seems my hatred for the boy who bullied me in school is not a good friend, but an irrational reaction  unlike his actions, i ""own"" my response 

i'm especially curious about source materials that would help me think about these reactions ( "

listen to the need for connection that chimes out of joy in their smile

1,"how to have an argument? context  i love in the uk

my parents have consistently voted for a political party which i believe has actively hindered my life for the immediate and long term future  politics is innevitably something that comes up in family discussions, and it's something i feel very passionately about 

i have a lot of love for my parents, and they have given me an incredibly good childhood   so i'm 
cautious of upsetting them, insulting their intelligence, or just straight disrespecting them in any discussions we have about the current political climate  

it's difficult, as i don't really interact with anybody who votes as they do in my daily life, and i feel like they're my only lightning rod for anger as the only people i know who have different political views from me

as someone who suffers from depression, a lot of internet strangers and friends and even loved ones have told me ""just soldier through it, things will get better ""  i usually respond by asking if they're a fortune teller, and what the next day's lotto numbers are  we have no guarantee what tomorrow, next week, next year, next decade will be like  we don't even know if we'll live past this moment, let alone to the ripe old age of 80  making assumptions that ""tomorrow will be better"" will only make us more wretched if when it is not    happiness can only come from the current moment    when you focus too much on the future, you are taking happiness away from today  because by the nature of comparison when you say tomorrow will be better you are implying that today is worse  

so, instead of hoping for a better future, it is easier and far more rewarding to just get better at dealing with things  in stoicism, this simply translates into practicing the ability to judge things for what they are and not what society tells you they should be  death for example, is not a terrible thing, else it would have appeared so to socrates  we think it is bad because we've been taught that it is bad  it is within our power as stoics to be okay with and accept anything that happens to us with equanimity and tranquility  this is done by changing our perceptions of things, not by hoping that those things will conform to our perceptions 

hope this helps  cheers

1,"everything that does not affect you directly is not actually your problem   i was reading marcus aurelius  meditations and i think an important stoic concept that he details in it is the process of  zooming out , that is, sort of trying to place yourself and your issues to scale with the universe  and thereby seeing how small you and your issues actually are  i like to think of and remember this idea when i watch or read the news  news media is not how it used to be  no more 6 o clock news delivered once a day by walter cronkite  no more morning newspaper reads  etc  in 2020 the news companies bombard you with agonizing information because they profit from your continued attention  it is their goal to monetize your fear  anyways, the news is just an example  it s kind of like that common stoic quote that men are always climbing imaginary mountains in their minds  they are  being stoic is about concern for the tangible issues rather than the ephemeral and ethereal  just as it is important to accept misfortune as an inevitable consequence of life, and not to let it affect you psychologically, so it is important to be able to determine what misfortune is in the first place "

1,"on the youtuber andrew kirby i've been watching his videos for some time way back when he was posting more frequently about stoicism, and no one in this community has really talked about him before  i'm curious as to what you lot think about him, personally i find his content these days to have deviated from his original stuff and has nothing really to do with stoicism anymore  if anyone has any thoughts, as i'm curious to see the opinions of it "
1," he who has a why to live, can bear almost any how    friedrich nietzsche these words came to me, a few days ago via my amazing friend  i was not able to get under the direct logic implied by the words and comprehend their full meaning as i was suffering what i perceived as an almost unbearable amount of pain, after a personal loss, the details of which bear no importance to the present text 

it was only this morning that i have stumbled upon an interview of doctor viktor frankl that opened my eyes  he stated that despair   that thing that a lot of times even ends up leading to suicide   is the equivalent of pain minus meaning  it s a simple equation that helped me understand that it was not pain that made me howl in the midst of a torrent of tears, but despair  that is the body s way of dealing with pain when meaning is not present  

you see, an easy example would be a horribly persistent toothache that finally makes you cry! what makes you burst into tears? is it the pain? does the pain source go away after you cry? it doesn t, yet you suffer less  your body just reacts to the desperation you fell when you think that the intense pain will last forever and it will never drop in intensity 

what if the meaning behind that toothache is that you need a lesson in oral hygiene and in not skipping your visits to the dentist? i have a vague intuition that this kind of thought process would make it far easier to deal with until the painkillers kick in  because, you see, using painkillers from time to time is not cheating  but not part of this discussion either 

what was i doing wrong, then? the pain is real  i can testify to that as i still feel it in my chest right now  that left me only with the lack of meaning  and it was not my life that i saw no meaning in, but the need to go through the constant rash of pain that felt like it was going to last forever and then some more  

another article, written by a gentleman called ricardo guaderrama, entitled  neediness stinks like poop , that i have read earlier, clarified what the meaning was  i had to transform from a needy person into a more self reliant one  

you see, i have allowed myself to depend on another person and a set of rules that i saw as being embedded in the fabric of the universe  and guess what? it came to light that it was an unreliable person and personal universe  a very small one, meant only to keep me comfortable 

there is no intrinsic meaning in pain  the only way you can get that is through your reason  i feel like most of the religions and philosophies that i know of deal with that exact problem in different ways  i believe they all have some value to them, even if i might not agree with some  

the buddhists take what i call  the coward s approach  and try to nullify existence to escape pain  one could argue that they are only a step above people that commit suicide (due to despair, not to some clinical problem), because the eternal cycle of reincarnation leaves out no escape, other than nirvana and that needs some work behind it  i would say that the end game is the same in both cases, even if you have different ways of reaching it 

christians decide to devote themselves to approaching a state close to divinity  even if lack of reason is associated with them nowadays, i find plenty of that in their decision  otherwise how could you practice self sacrifice for the greater good, against your own self preservation? i find that approach as more noble than the buddhist approach as they are not turning their backs to pain, but try to associate meaning to it 

as far as i understand, the stoic approach would be to use your reason and see what virtue or virtues you were lacking that the meaning associated to your pain was lost or was never associated  were you relying on externals (as i did, for example)? were you careless with your internals (as i did as well)? are you lacking courage, wisdom, moderation or justice? what if you lack more than one of them? do you not understand that you cannot lose something that was never yours, anyway?

just to make it clear, this whole thing is only a few hours old  why i keep repeating to myself is that despair is pain without meaning, each time i feel it circling me  that is probably going to prove not enough at some point, but i feel that i have taken some of my weight off my friend s back and i can already control what i feel better  and if that is not a double win, i don t know what else could be

1,"i always saw my fears and anxiety as a weakness, until i read this  how to think like a roman emperor   donald robertson
 in the meditations, marcus himself writes that although he tells troubling impressions to go away, he is not angry with them because they have come according to their  ancient manner   in other words, they arise in the way basic feelings also arise in animals that implies that, like the anonymous stoic teacher on gellius s storm tossed boat, marcus views them with indifference rather than judging them as inherently bad  elsewhere he says that pleasant and unpleasant sensations in the body inevitably impinge on the mind because they re part of the same organism we shouldn t try to resist them, but rather we should accept their occurrence as natural, as long as we don t allow our mind to add the judgment that the things we re experiencing are good or bad  this is important, because people who confuse  stoicism  with  stoicism  (i e , having a stiff upper lip) often think that it s about suppressing feelings like anxiety, which they view as bad, harmful, or shameful  that s not only bad psychology, it s also totally in conflict with stoic philosophy, which teaches us to accept our involuntary emotional reactions, our flashes of anxiety, as indifferent  neither good nor bad  what matters, in other words, isn t what we feel but how we respond to those feelings  "

1,"how often to sit and think about stoicism? if i just try to go and 'apply' stoicism to every aspect of my life, eventually i forget to do it, or something comes around which i don't instinctively have a stoic answer for  to prepare for this, i'd regularly revisit stoic principles by reading and journalling about them, for example  

but how often? if i do it every day, it starts to feel useless because i'm just doing nothing and idk when any difficult obstacles will come, and it feels like a waste of time when i should be maybe, applying it and practicing actively, or at least being productive in some other aspect of my life  but, reading writing something stoic once every few days is a difficult habit to keep sometimes  and if i just do that whenever the need arises, then it first requires a need to arise   in other words i allow myself to first fall into error, and only then start revisiting stoicism as a way to fix it  it seems like a poor way to go about it and i can't really imagine epictetus doing it that way, for example?

so, how often do you suggest me to read stoic texts, journal about it, think deeply about these fundamental principles? and how do i know which principles to focus on today?"

  what is most important?   raising your mind above the threats and promises of fortune, thinking that nothing is worth hoping for  for what have you to desire? whenever you sink back from engagement with the divine to the human level, your sight will go dim, just like the eyes of those who return from bright sunlight to dense shadow  

 amp nbsp 

  what is most important?   being able to endure adversity with a glad mind, to experience whatever happens as though you wanted it to happen to you  for you ought to have wanted it to, if you had known that everything happens according to god s decree  crying, complaining,  and moaning are rebellion  

 amp nbsp 

  what is most important?   a mind that is brave and defiant in the face of calamity, not just opposed but hostile to luxury, neither courting nor fleeing danger  one that knows not to wait for fortune but to create it, to go to face both forms unafraid and undismayed, unshaken either by the turmoil of the one or the glitter of the other 

 amp nbsp 

  what is most important?   refusing to let bad intentions enter your mind  raising pure hands to heaven  not seeking any good thing if someone else must give it or must lose it so that it may pass to you  wishing for a sound mind (something that can be wished for without competition)  regarding the other things rated highly by mortals, even if some chance brings  them into your home, as likely to exit by the door they entered   

 amp nbsp 

  what is most important?   raising your spirits high above chance events  remembering your human status, so that if you are fortunate,  you know that will not last long, and if you are unfortunate, you know you are not so if you do not think so  

 amp nbsp 

  what is most important?    having your soul on your lips  this makes you free not according to  the law of the committee, but according to the law of nature  a free person is one who escapes enslavement to himself, which is constant, unavoidable, oppressing by day and by night equally, without break, without relief  

 amp nbsp 

enslavement to oneself is the most severe enslavement, but it is easy to shake it off if you stop expecting a lot from yourself, if you stop making money for yourself, if you set before your eyes both your nature and your age, even if it is very young, and say to yourself,  why am i going crazy? why am i panting? why am i sweating? why am i working the land, or the forum? i don t need much, and not for long  "

1,"need guidance in managing expectations like many people out there i had a very challenging year and even daily stoicism reminders and breathing exercises didn't help and i spent the spring and summer in depression  in late august, i got a well paid and stable job and things started to get better  a few weeks back, i took some concrete actions to realise my childhood dream and applied to a phd programme  last week, i had one of the best interviews in my life  the interview was so unexpectedly good that during the interview, the professor who's responsible for the phd students in the department asked me to send a mail to her to put me in touch with another scholar who's also focusing on the same subject  there were a lot of nodding, agreeing and smiling  the department will inform me with their decision by december but i'm struggling with managing my expectations  i can't stop imagining about living the dream i've been dreaming for years, being part of a university that i wanted to be, doing the things that i wanted to do   while dreaming these makes me happy and i find myself smiling, i also realise there may be other candidates who were as good or better than me  so, i'm asking for a stoic guidance in managing the expectations  please tell me any books articles podcasts etc  you have used or you suggest me to use that can guide me in managing my hopes and expectations  i really don't want to go back into depression but i'm scared that when i'm very close to achieving my dream a ""no"" can tip things over in my mental health

1,"how similar is stoicism to mindfulness? i've been practicing mindfulness meditation for almost an year now and tried to make some changes in my life which include  
1  living in the present moment
2  ability to identify my thoughts and not engaging with those which can lead to strong emotions
3  trying to enjoy and express gratitude for small things in life
4  not engaging with things which are not under my control  i've reduced my news consumption for this reason
5  trying to attain greater awareness of myself through meditation practices
6  not resisting negative thoughts and feelings and realising that 'they too shall pass'

i was discussing this with a friend a few days back and he said this is very similar to stoicism, which made me explore stoic philosophy to an extent 

so was curious to know if these two practices are similar or not? also, what are the key differences between them if any?"

however, from a recent experience, i'm starting to appreciate the misses as much as the wins thanks in part to some stoic thinking   i wanted to share in case it would encourage other young men   


recently, i had been going on several dates with someone who i truly enjoyed being around  however, after the 8th date (a big number for me since i rarely want to go on a 2nd), we both figured that taking the next step into a relationship wasn't wise  (our senses of humor didn't match )  


at the tail end of our our last phone convo, something she said struck me, ""even though this didn't work out, i know something good will come of this ""   


i agreed with her and explained the concept of ""amor fati"", to love fate  that whatever happens becomes fuel for the fire of your life   i love this concept, especially because it ties in to a biblical verse (i'm a christian)  "" we know that all things work together for good to those who love god, to those who are called according to his purpose ""

1,"question about meditations so i started reading meditations and in the part about marcus aurelius (what a badass that guy is btw, look what he endured and how handled it) before book 1 there is a sentence about stoicism and repressing emotions

 there were under the early empire two rival schools which practically
divided the field between them, stoicism and epicureanism 
the ideal set before each was nominally much the same 
the stoics aspired to the repression of all emotion,
and the epicureans to freedom from all disturbance  yet in
the upshot the one has become a synonym of stubborn endurance,
the other for unbridled licence  

what do they mean with repressing emotions ? in my mind it means not acknowledging them and not allowing them to exist, fighting against the emotion itself and not letting it be  (again, against the emotion itself, not talking about letting the emotion rule me or not) in my mind this doesn t sound very good for your mental health, at least not in my experience with myself  

am i interpreting this the right way way it was intended to or not ?"
1,what are your thoughts on this article? 
1,"am i acting self righteously? after i started immersing myself in stoicism, my courage have greatly increased, i feel that i now have a purpose in life, to act according to virtue, and to do what is right, i no longer worry about outcomes, if there something that i should do, then it should be done, people who live their entire life standing up for nothing are wasting it for good, and nothing good may come out of cowardice, we didn't come to this world to live comfortably, sometimes you need to act, and your act may make your life harsher, but it still better than living in a bubble with no purpose, shielded from any criticism or danger    


but i can't help but feel that i'm being that self righteous prick that everyone dislikes, today while coming home, i found a pet shop that kept a monkey outside in a cage exposed to sun light, i felt that it is my duty to say something, to do something, at this very moment i just wanted to believe as much as i could that this monkey wasn't suffering, but in reality it was, i didn't do anything at that moment, partly because i wanted to know my options, selling monkeys is illegal in my countries, so i thought about calling the police, but after i rang my brother who's an officer, he told me that the police doesn't care about such things, and there is no one i could call, he still sympathized with me and agreed to give that shop an unofficial visit tomorrow    


now for some reason i'm starting to feel like i'm acting self righteous, and it is a bad feeling, anyone else can relate to this?"
1,"the stoic universe   everything flows from here   ""whatever may happen to thee, it was prepared for thee from all eternity  and the implication of causes was from eternity spinning the thread of thy being and of that which is incident to it ""     meditations, marcus aurelius

stoicism as a philosophy depended on its theory of the universe to justify its maxims, as it should be for any philosophy to be more than a mere exercise in motivational coaching and psychotherapy  it held that the world at large was eternal, yet ever changing, and imbued with reason and intelligence  this they inherited from the wisdom of heraclitus, which posited a world driven by a mystic fire  from the stanford  encyclopedia ( we have this passage 

 amp  x200b 

 gt   the stoic god is immanent throughout the whole of creation and directs its development down to the smallest detail  the governing metaphor for stoic cosmology is biological, in contrast to the fundamentally mechanical conception of the epicureans  the entire cosmos is a living thing and god stands to the cosmos as an animal s life force stands to the animal s body, enlivening, moving and directing it by its presence throughout     

there is a prevailing current in modern science, starting around the time of descartes, to view the world as an entirely mechanical operation  it's all machinery moving about without any particular direction  a thought shared by the epicureans   you can see how they would justify their pursuit of pleasures in a world devoid of reason in this manner, and how the stoics would justify their pursuit of wisdom as an opposing plan  thus the importance of having a well defined worldview that underpins all the particular instances of philosophical thought  merely practicing ""memento mori"" doesn't mean anything if one believes the universe is meaningless and random  

 amp  x200b 

 gt   more specifically, god is identical with one of the two ungenerated and indestructible first principles (archai) of the universe  one principle is matter which they regard as utterly unqualified and inert  it is that which is acted upon  god is identified with an eternal reason (logos, diog  laert  44b ) or intelligent designing fire or a breath (pneuma) which structures matter in accordance with its plan (aetius, 46a)    the designing fire is likened to sperm or seed which contains the first principles or directions of all the things which will subsequently develop (aristocles in eusebius, 46g)     

this world of fire is intuitively similar to the modern theory of cosmological growth of the universe  the big bang says in part that the universe spent hundreds of thousands of years as an immense ball of atomic fire  the remaining signal of this era is called the cosmic microwave background or cmb for short  this is all well and good, but it still isn't enough to be the stoic universe  after all, doesn't the big bang say that the universe had a beginning? doesn't that mean that the world isn't eternal? well yes and no   we do know that the universe had a hot and dense origin, but everything before the era of the cmb is pure speculation  the big bang theory is only a hypothesis based on an extreme interpretation of einstein's theory of general relativity  yet it is by design untestable since it demands a point of infinite energy, which is a scientifically unsound postulate  even einstein didn't really believe in it  at his time, scientists believed in a steady state model, where the universe remained equal during all times, never really evolving  stoicism offered a middle ground solution between steady state and the big bang theory, millenia before our time   the world is eternal, yet ever changing, and it is born from fire and returns to fire  

 amp  x200b 

 gt   just as living things have a life cycle that is witnessed in parents and then again in their off spring, so too the universe has a life cycle that is repeated  this life cycle is guided by, or equivalent to, a developmental plan that is identified with god  there is a cycle of endless recurrence, beginning from a state in which all is fire, through the generation of the elements, to the creation of the world we are familiar with, and eventually back to the state of pure designing fire called  the conflagration  (nemesius, 52c)   

but this is all just theoretical speculation from ignorant people who didn't know modern science, you might be thinking  ""modern stoics are atheists and mechanistics, nobody takes this seriously anymore!"" no, not, you'd be wrong about all of these rebuttals  there are truly scientific models of just such a world  a universe marked by repeating cycles of birth by fire and rebirth is completely possible according to the latest theories of quantum mechanics and general relativity  there has even been advances in finding experimental evidence of such events in recent years with promising results  true, it isn't the most popular idea, but it is a true possibility  it is called  conformal cyclic cosmology ( and its principal proponent, roger penrose is a nobel prize winning cosmologist   so it's not merely the vaggaries of random intellectuals 

see this pbs video for an explanation of the theory   

 amp  x200b 

 gt   whether the soul of the world called a man to be surrounded by pleasures or tortured to death, whatever happens is appropriate to the rational design of the universe  thus, the wise man should be indifferent and accept the things over which he has no control, letting his soul live in conformity to the divine plan of the universe     
 gt   
 gt   the stoic, therefore, sought happiness not through the amassing of pleasures, but through living in conformity with the design of the universal being, the soul of the world or pneuma  this was believed to be the height of stoic virtue  to be above passions, to receive pain as readily as pleasure, and to calmly and rationally withhold assent from false judgments, accepting whatever fate sends you   

 amp  x200b 

this is from a modern critic of stoicism from a catholic point of view  (source) ( but he's right in his interpretation, if of a pessimistic view of it  it is precisely because the stoic believes that the universe has  reason  and  causation  that the stoic assents to fate    forget all the calendars, coins, remembrances, quotes, amulets, paintings   none of that will help you when fate comes knocking on your door and you have no clue why  

without a belief in a  stoic world , all the  stoic memes  are mere rhetoric "

1,looking for quote and advice i have recently undergone surgery to repair 4 hernias  the pain is quite extreme and quite constant  i understand that a reaction to pain can be stoic as it is still natural to wince or to hunch over while walking because standing straight might cause me to blackout  but i'm searching for advice on how people avoid the self pity 
1,"meaning in life  accepting pointlessness? i know where i derive meaning in life  stoicism is a tool to me to help me keep a level head to advance that meaning  i feel like i can apply it fairly well    except on this one point  the lack of  

to spare the details, fate has placed me in a position where i am unable to do what matters to me in life, and, in that front, continues beating me down before i can even get up and yanking from me what i believed to have been past success 

i want to make the best of my life according to what matters to me  mortality and we can die tomorrow and all that, so make the most of it, eh? but i struggle to accept when fate won't allow me to  i feel empty, because the entirety of my meaning depends entirely on future, hypothetical probabilities   fate's hands, not mine  

my life in its current state has no meaning outside of what is up for fate to decide  if  it wants to give me in the future  and that thought scares me  that that may never change to any significant extent  i can accept, in general, a lack of control in practically any other area, including my mortality, except for  this one thing   anything that influences my perceived level of meaning for living   this  is my one weak spot  i don't care about living  but i do care about living rightly  thus, lack of opportunity to do so hurts 

could i shift my meaning to simply trying, to acting virtuously, and accepting the rest? perhaps  but i find it hard to do so  because what matters to me is getting a result  doing that won't get me any more results, and knowing me, i fear may make me more apathetic towards my goals  thus i am hesitant and would certainly struggle to make that shift 

i am ashamed to admit that following an event last night that once again punched me with meaninglessness, i got angry at life and partially let that out on someone  does anyone have advice for acceptance here? unless there's another route that i should take here?"

1,"stocism and expectations (self motivation) from my understanding of stocism , stocism doesn't tshg3 expectations , cause must of the things in life are not under your control , you can effect your goals positively or negatively but you can't 100  accomplish your goals , and iam not talking about small goals that under your control , am talking about big goals like getting promotion at work , or succeeding in the academic path   so you can't associated something you can't control with meaning of good and bad , the questions if succeeding at university is not good or bad , so how can you motivate your self to actually do what's in your control ? without the meaning of good and bad , without expectations ?
the thing is you can't motivate your self to do something big without the expectations that you have that you will succeed and it's going to work , otherwise why work hard if you are not sure that the outcome will be good ?"

1,"stoicism for a better life   weekly exercise (october 28) hello there, 

for this week s exercise, let us find some inspiration from epictetus (who's teacher will be our inspiration next week)  this is from the enchiridion (not to be confused with epictetus' discourses) li 2 

 gt ""   it depends on a single day and single action whether progress is to be lost or secured  ""  

all we have control over with 100  certainty is our judgments and thoughts in the present moment or the ""here and now""  we also know that we are only truly living (a big distinction from being alive) while we are engaged in the ""here and now"" with our rational minds (this is what some refer to as being mindful)  therefore our lives can be summed up in one single continuous sequence of present moments 

if we can truly accept the past as being in the past and out of our control and remain focused on our efforts right here and right now, then we can also accept that whatever we did in the past is meaningless as far as the goodness of our moral characters is concerned  virtue is not found in the list of past accomplishments, but in our current efforts right now   

  so as a practical exercise this week, try and live with a singular focus on your current efforts    don't think about what bad things you did earlier in the day or week  no matter how many bad choices you made in the past (right up to this present moment), you have the choice to be virtuous and make good decisions right now  along the same lines, no matter how virtuous you may have been in the past, those are already done and gone  you cannot make ignoble choices right now, with the impunity of knowing you made ten good choices earlier in the day    each moment is a new opportunity to show our moral goodness and the way we show it is through our judgments and choices for actions in the present moment   

i hope you find this exercise inspirational  if you feel like it, i would encourage you to share some of your experiences  it may very well help inspire others

1,"stoicism  finding the balance between 'carpe diem' and ""que sera sera"" this is my personal elevator speech when someone asks me about stoicism  for those of you who don't know, ""carpe diem"" means seize the day(because it's all we have) and ""que sera sera"" translates to ""whatever will be, will be"" in the romantic, latin based languages  ""c'est la vie"" is another good one  they may sound conflicting, but the balance between the two is where stoicism lies 

que sera sera is fundamental in understanding and practicing stoicism   ""don't demand that things happen as you wish, but wish that they happen as they do happen, and you will go on well ""      enchiridion 8 ( the future is going to happen  there will be bad weather, and good weather  there will be trials, as well as triumphs  your loved ones will die  you will die  it is infinitely easier to accept reality as it is and learn to live with it, than waste energy assuming you control something that you do not  

however, do not let an overabundance of ""it is what it is"" devolve you into fatalism and ""life is pointless, why bother trying"", either  this is where carpe diem comes into play 

the only time we have is the present  the past has already happened, and the future hasn't happened yet  it may sound clich , but this is one of the foundations of stoicism  marcus puts it nicely in  meditations 2 14 (  ""         for a man cannot lose either the past or the future  for what a man has not, how can any one take this from him?         the longest liver and he who will die soonest lose just the same ""  we seize the day because it's all we have   we do not exist to be idle ( we have duties, whether as a parent, a spouse, a neighbor, or just as a citizen of society  we study for that test, we work our ass off for that promotion, we exercise our body today because it may make the future better, and because the alternative is   what? to lay in bed all day wallowing? 

however, do not get so excited about the possible future fruits of your present labors that you become upset when they do not turn out the way you wanted them to  this is where que sera sera comes into play 

if it helps you to have something to whistle to yourself on the bad days, here's doris day's song,  que sera sera ( cheers "

1,"is it weird that i m really interested in stoicism at 18? i m halfway through reading meditations and honestly i m hooked, i m so interested in stoicism and philosophy in general  i m just wondering if i m  weird  for being interested in this at 18 and if they re any other people my age on here as well? i even have to hide the books from my parents because i don t want them thinking i m weird lol "
1,"stoic practice is only a shadow of its theory  we can only become as close to  sage  as possible  i think the biggest misunderstanding of stoicism(as well as everything) is that theory can be directly translated into practice  when introduced to stoicism, many ppl actually think that is the case no  it takes time, effort, and real life experience adversity to react to, to learn how to act with virtue, and to develop a stoic mindset   to become familiar with the practice of the philosophy  stoicism is not a button you can turn on off  it will never become perfect  

like william o  stevens puts it, ""exercise stoic virtues like patience, understanding, and cooperativeness, and flex them every day like they're muscles  focus on your errors and think about correcting them  

bonus quote  ""it's silly to try to escape other people's faults  they are inescapable  just try to escape your own ""

if ycant achieve a good looking body by thinking you have one  let alone if you pay for a gym membership  you have to put in the work "
1,"can i run this idea by you stoics? hey stoics, new poster here and relatively new to stoicism too but everything i've learned about it so far has changed my way of thinking and i'm starting to act differently so happy to be on this journey 

you seem like a good bunch of people with your heads screwed on that would give me your honest opinion so   

  could i run an idea by you ?  

i have an idea which i'm tentatively calling ""not taught in school"" at the moment 

it was born from the idea that as you get older you realise there are so many skills you need in life that you just aren't taught in school (or by family or society in general) 

such as   

money and finance skills, mindset and mental health, self learning and self improvement, preparedness and survival, relationship and social skills, entrepreneurship and creating wealth and so on (basically anything that constitutes a useful ""life skill"") 

  and of course stoicism   

so my idea is simple   

to create a free weekly email newsletter that curates the best content that is teaching valuable life skills and lessons that most people wouldn't learn about elsewhere 

i'm already reading lots of websites around these topics and know who a lot of the top authors, bloggers and influencers are where as newcomers don't so i feel like i could curate a lot of useful content for them and save them a lot of time 

it would be a simple email round up highlighting the content and linking to it, sharing the general idea behind each piece of content, and with some additional commentary by myself sharing my thoughts and insights into the content and why it's worth reading   learning 

i know from my own experience it's too time consuming and overwhelming to keep up with all the different websites, blogs, yt channels and social influencers in one ""niche"" let alone several, so   

   the newsletter would aim to save you time and highlight only the most valuable and useful content that's actually worth reading in an internet filled with junk and spam 

like i said above  it would be absolutely free to join and wouldn't be monetized initially but if it gained some traction then i may bring on sponsors   advertisers in future or scale it up into a full website 

however   

before i spend too much time on this only to find there's not a great deal of interest then i'm looking to validate the idea 

which is where you come in hopefully 

based on what i've summarised above (and i know it's brief but all the details are not fleshed out yet and it'll be built on feedback from readers   interested readers)   

  would you subscribe to the ""not taught in school"" newsletter?  

even if you wouldn't personally subscribe   

  do you think it would be a useful service for someone who's new to self improvement and just starting on their journey?  

let me know what you think good or bad please stoics   )"
1,"books for the beginner stoic? hey stoics, despite the fact that i've been on the self improvement journey for many years, and studying   practicing everything from nlp to psychology to journaling to meditation to positive mindset and beyond, i'm still relatively new to stoicism  

i've even been aware of it for some time but never actually studied it until recently  

i've bought marcus aurelius' meditations but it's not an easy read to say the least  

but i've just finished reading ""the little book of stoicism"" and now starting on ""the daily stoic"" (as well as being subscribed to the daily email list which has been great) and those seem good beginner friendly books 

anything else the beginner stoic be reading   learning from and putting into practice?

thanks"
1,"my girlfriend of 2 years cheated and refuse to admit  she has been acting weird around our family friend, and i've decided to break up with her

i am torn  part of me know that i don't neither of the three parties and that i should just accept this , break up and move on with my life  but for some reason whenever i forget something remind me that it happenend 

maybe i should stop and realize that i am disturbed by my lack of trust of her

1,"sometime ago i asked advice on to cope with post purchase anxiety  the answers helped me a few days ago i posted here looking for advice on a stoic way of coping with over analysing, chasing perfection and doubting my choices  it was about having bought a car, and continuing to research afterwards (doubting whether or not i made the right decision)  i bought it after some research and avoided certain options advised to me by a friend mechanic  as someone starting i needed a car that's reliable and cheap to keep running 

for those interested  it was about a punto (evo)  there's a proven 1 4 8v engine for it that's basically bulletproof, economical en easy and cheap to keep running and therefore advised to me  and there was the newer 0 9l twinair (yes a two cilinder)  although the reviews on the second are very good, as it's a really fun inspiring engine  it's nowhere as economical as they promise it to be, and needs special oil to run and keep running 

after having the car for a few days i wondered if i had made the right decision, went online to look for the same car but with a different engine and in the end even went to look at other cars  only reinforcing my doubts about my purchase 

in hindsight, totally pointless and unfair to the car i had standing at my front door 

i received some really good advice about just being happy with whatever decision you make  some people told me that i made my decision based on the information i had at the moment, and i did 

  perfection just doesn't exist  if you're holding regret or uncertainty(anxiety) over a possession, you don't own it, it owns you    u taskforceslacker told me this

so i stopt looking around and just started enjoying the car  and now, i love that little brave machine  it's working for me now, and i like using it for what i bought it 

sure there are faster cars around, sure there are better cars around  but at the moment, that car is the right one for me until the time comes for something else  i started owning it again, instead of it owning me "

1,"what is the meaning to life to a stoic? and is it appropriate for a stoic to search for a meaning to life? 

 virtue, and duty  come to mind as answers, but why virtue and why duty?

i think i have accepted that life is inherently meaningless, and this obscures my view of virtue and duty  

this accepted truth, or better  perspective , that life is meaningless is disenfranchising my motivation to live virtuously and dutifully  because at the end of it, i ask myself,  if everything is meaningless, why does virtue and duty mean anything?  

it is a destructive nihilistic mindset, and it makes me very afraid  i would like to find meaning in my life on a daily basis  but sometimes it is tough  

could anyone offer alternate perspectives on the matter? thank you "

1,"i have this problem of unprocessed feelings? dear community, 

i know this not r relationshipadvice but from what i read there, i feel most advice there isn t useful  

anyway, here my problem  

i have wonderful partner  however, we haven t seen us for long long time due to covid 19 and visa issues  this is not too much of an issue because we also have a company together and therefore spend much (virtual) time with each other despite the distance  

i believe that her feelings for me a real but i find myself hyper sensitive to even the smallest things she does  maybe it s because we are also from very different cultures  

i do think i am hyper sensitive because on a rational level, i see she s providing me with much affirmation at times  e g  sending me love songs etc  however, she is also very cold at times, which is normal for her  i know that 

i love that woman and i love the company and future we we building together  my question is now  do you have any practical advice how to control my hyper sensitive? 

i remember to be always very sensitive early on in relationships, yet it usually fades away with time as become certain of my partners love  now we stuck in a ldr, and i find myself trapped in this early emotional stage of a relationship pregnant with (unreasonable  amp  unproductive) doubts  

i am glad over practical input and trainings i can perform to work on me

1,"practicing stoic   how do i deal with my lack of emotion to life? i have been a practicing stoic for about a year and a half  i have read marcus aurelius, most of seneca, epictetus, and some modern stoics like ryan holiday  

i love stoicism and i used to be a very emotional and scared person before it  

i hardly get angry anymore or react to anything  when i am cut off in traffic i no longer react  i have found that things that used to trouble me for a long time now i get over quickly  

the problem is that i now don't really feel anything at all  i think i have taken stoicism to the extreme whereas i would like to be a stoic like seneca and be more human  before there were more highs and lows but now it is mostly in the middle  i am never overly upset nor very happy  i guess that is a trade off  

what do you guys think about this? how have you dealt with this? do you accept this as a necessary evil, or do you have a method to introduce more highs in your life?"

why do i think memento moir is good? i will stay why i, as a particular individual like this idea  im on my early 20s  im in college and i feel like im not doing anything fun memorable exiting or any ""cool"" thing, im also not doing anything meaningful, anything that might help others  i procrastinate not only on my homework but on my life too  i always forget that there might not be a tomorrow and i forget what that im basically living like a maggot and i know there are many like me out there  

having this thing in front of you when you wake up and see how many weeks you might have left, it can wake the fuck up  its not depressing, its reality  if looking at your life makes it depressing and scary then maybe that might be the problem in thy life

personally i will do this  i will review each week every sunday and i will give it a color, either green or red  green if i think i did great in terms of the output i gave to the world  red if i think i was bad  there should be red weeks and i think for a normal human  there will be more red than green but your goal is to have as many greens as possible 

disclaimer  outside influences will not be included in the performance like  remember use your stoic mindset to determine if you did well and dont use capitalistic or 21th century ""performance"" measures  you are using this to analyze your well being and the output you give to the world  again be stoic and stoic in the judgment of the week  

the goal is to feel better about yourself and see what have you done and why do you feel a certain way  life is short and for us that are young, to forget that theres more to life that we are living right now is a sin "
1,"new here! hello everyone!

im new here! a couple of months ago i started to notice that the entire covid quarantine started to affect me in a negative way  so i started to look for new ways of thinking and directions that could help me when times are difficult  and that s how i learned about stoicism and it really appealed to me  so i wanted to learn more about stoicism and started reading the work of marcus aurelius  i bought  meditations  in english (which is not my native tongue) and i m not going to deny it is quite a read  but still i learn valuable lessons and i try to apply them into my daily life  

so now that i almost finished the book i thought  there s probably is a subreddit for this  and that s how i got here  i wanted to ask how people here apply stoicism in their lives and how they benefit from it  i would love to hear from more experienced stoics  oh and if anyone has some tips for good books, podcasts, movies etc about stoicism please let me know  again, i would love to learn more about this philosophy 

thanks everyone!  "
1,"question on events outside of my control and where that distinction is hi everyone   i m relatively new to stoicism but one thing i see coming up a lot in texts i ve been reading is the idea that when things fall outside of my control, and influence that i should focus on my own thoughts and actions and the response to the event, not to the event itself  

my question is where does that line get drawn   i saw a modern day example of  if my train is delayed i have no control over that  which is absolutely true for that train  but i could lobby the train company, write complaints etc  and then next time i would be content that i d  done all i can beforehand  and it s balancing that feeling of i m not doing enough with being okay with it  

obviously i won t write to the train companies, nor would i have time to take every example to extremis, and that s the problem is there s always a situation where i could have done more etc but has anyone found any solutions to this or ways of thinking about it?"

i live in the us and everyone is so angry and divided these days  there are wildfires  the pandemic  constant, relentless mudslinging  climate change  i am afraid for my health and for my rights and for everyone else 

i am a firm believer in just    leaving people alone  practicing the religion you want, and letting others do the same  living your life by your own standards, and again, letting others do the same  as long as no one is getting hurt by your choices, what's the big deal? be christian, love your guns, be gay, do what makes you happy 

but it feels that no one believes that anymore  it feels to be all or nothing  there is no unity or common ground  no actions done for the best interest of people as a whole  

i don't know what i should be caring about right now, and it's exhausting  i'm tired of being afraid, of being concerned about whether or not my legal status will be revoked or if i will no longer be able to afford healthcare or if the women in my life will have to go through things they never wanted to go through, or if the pandemic will end soon, or if the world will have clean air in 20 years  

i'm constantly anxious these days  i have been practicing stoicism for a while now and can usually calm myself but i'm having a harder time lately  

what is the right thing to focus on under stoicism? how can i stay calm?"
1,made me think of those momento mori calendar charts 
1,"how do i ""separate"" my life from my parents' life? i feel guilty and stressed  please read everything, it is a huge burden on my shoulders   my parents life was full of struggle and challenges 
  my life is better currently  i have food, shelter, money 
  i also have freedom to pursue a career, choose the kind of life i want to live which my mother didnot have (she was restricted by a super strict mother before marriage, married at 20, i was born when she was 21, lived alone in a rural city for 11 years after marriage   third world  , struggled alone because father was working in another city)  
  my mother belonged to a nice family but due to the turn of fate she was married into a humble family with not much fortune  my father's family had ""social respect"" but respect alone does not pay your bills  my father had to put his blood and sweat and tears to create the wealth equal to what my mother's family owned and that is still not enough  their marriage was socially, financially, mentally a mismatch  
  my mother was never allowed to think for herself  her mother always made her feel inferior, like a loser who must depend on her husband  my mother in turn also used these tricks on me to kill my self confidence because she must have seen her ""faults and weaknesses"" in me  
  now i am adult, it took me long time to become ""sensible""  i remember vaguely that my parents were on the verge of divorce when i was in class 4 aged 8, father tried to asphyxiate me in bucket of water when i was 3 or 4, saw my mother crying a lot through my teenage  she used to say that her life was ruined, dreams were shattered, blamed me too  both parents threatened suicide regularly  on top of that, i was beaten a lot (i have understood the mindset of my mother and forgiven her completely)  
  we have been living a ""stable"" life at our home built with my father's tears since 2013  when we thought that life was finally better, father was diagnosed with cancer in 2019  he is in remission  
  now i have a huge burden on my heart  of course i am to blame for everything  being a girl, i was a  liability on my father and i was born so soon that my mother herself was a young adult  i did ruin her life (in contrast, i don't want to have babies)  
  i cannot forgive myself  i feel like i don't have the right to enjoy my life  how can i be happy in my own life when my parents' life was ruined at my expense? i don't know why destiny tortured them like this  my mother was just like me in college when one day she was married off to my father and then life changed to what she had not even dreamt of  i get scared just by the thought of her misery and helplessness  just pure helplessness, no support from husband, no support from parents, no support from in laws  in 2004 my brother was born  just one day before the delivery, she travelled by herself on a rickshaw then overloaded taxi riding on damaged rural roads in the evening after her own work  her and i reached a better city where my uncle lived and she delivered my brother next morning  when i read about women saying how tough a pregnancy is then i remember my mother going to work, travelling alone and giving birth like that  it must have traumatized her  
  i am evil to them  i should have died long back  i used to think that my parents were at fault for acting the way they did  now i realize that they were helpless and confused  in contrast, a lot of my family members lived happy prosperous lives  of course my mother would feel jealous  her fate did her wrong  
  on the other hand, my father's fate is even unique  his 2 sisters, one young brother have all gone through deadly accidents and their bodies and faces are deformed  my father himself got oral cancer and his face is deformed  it feels like my grandmother's womb was sinful that she gave birth to children with such fates  
  i hate myself when i am happy  i don't ever want to be happy  what if my fate goes bad? i was suicidal in the past months, especially late 2019  i don't know why i am alive  i am very confused  
  this is my 100th time asking this question  i still don't have an answer  i feel like i want to hide myself and bury somewhere no one can find me  i am a culprit, a sin who destroyed my parents life and i will have to pay for my karma in my next life "
1,"stoicism and god gods higher powers hey all,

i started getting into stoicism about 2 months ago now as a way of deepening my connection with my truest self and those around me  in those two months i have primarily listened to stoic podcasts to and from work and while out driving for leisure  the four stoic virtues of courage, justice, wisdom, and temperance ring true to me  and find meaning and usefulness in the axioms spoken by the greats of the school of stoicism  

however, i am a recovered acloholic addict as well and i'm getting to the point in his sobriety where i would like to explore having a deeper relationship with some form of god gods higher power  in pursuit of this desire, i sought out guidance from someone who i look up to both in terms of their spirituality as well as their intellect  i began the conversation by expressing this desire and at some point along the way he mentioned journaling as an important part if his spiritual growth and development of a connection with god and the universe (the term god is used in an agnostic sense here, neither of us subscribe to a particular religion)  i agreed and brought up that i had, not too long ago, began studying stoic philosophy and that journaling was also a tool used by many stoics  he then told me that stoic beliefs and the idea of god did not necessarily align  that stoic thought is based primarily in the human will and the attempt to assert ones will upon the world  as someone who really does not know all too much about stoicism yet, i did not feel i could debate him, nor do i think that it would really do any good  however, i do know that there have been many misconceptions about the stoics over the millenia and i'm wondering if this is one of them  

i would greatly appreciate any knowledge or experience you all have to share, especially if you have had similar experiences  i would also like to assert preemptively that i do not find intellect and a belief in some form of god gods higher power to be mutually exclusive  thank you "
1,"an ethical loop? if someone does something bad they feel about it  they may then decide they are a bad person because if they were not then how could they do a bad thing?
now the reason they feel bad is because it is the right thing to do to feel bad if you have done wrong but if you are doing the right thing does that not make you a good person?
so if you stop feeling bad that makes you bad because only a bad person would not feel bad for doing wrong 
but if you feel good that makes you bad because you should feel bad

i despise discrimination of any kind and would not hesitate to call out someone who is badly behaved  however, with my family (parents included) this is a futile exercise and it really kills me to look the other way when they behave like this  what advise would you give me to help deal with these kind of situations? talking or explaining why discrimination is wrong doesn t go anywhere with them  there is a sense of entitlement and a deep sense of insecurity within the community that s specially prevalent among the upper class hindus 
i am looking of advise practices that i could use to maintain my own sanity while dealing with such people "

1,"a ""memento mori"" calendar in a spreadsheet like a good many of you, i saw  this post ( and thought it was equally fascinating and morbid (though that is the intention, to a degree) 

one of the things i saw in the comments was that some of you would be interested in  purchasing one of the calendars ( and others who would if it was a bit more affordable 

having a bit of a background in spreadsheet programming, i made this  google sheet ( that does can tell you the exact same thing   all you need to do is input your birthdate into the cell next to the prompt, and the sheet does the rest 

 amp  x200b 

i put the ""maximum"" at 80 and each box as a week, just like the calendar in the original post   if you want to extend your copy's, all you have to do is insert columns after the one with the 80 (cd, and extend the range cd2 cd55 to those new columns   doing so will throw off the percentage at the top, so you'd need to account for the additional range there, too 

privacy wise  since the link copies the sheet into your own google drive and there is no off sheet database processing, the only security concerns involved are that which you share with google   i neither get nor want any personal information input "

1,"my memento mori i never gave to much thought to it , but when i was a baby i had a disease, the likes of which would have turned my ""skin purple"" as my mother told me  my aunt is illiterate and she did not know what to do so she took me to a woman and she did the first aid procedures and saved me 

i should have been dead, even before i was conscientious of myself  i don't want to forget it and i want to use it to fuel myself to the goals and to love the people i love  and so when the time comes i might embrace it

1,"what is stoicisms view on organized religion? a friend and i were discussing where people would obtain a sense of morality and correct values 

i argued that my conscience can help me to determine what is moral and immoral  i think when a human does evil acts he feels guilt, as the soul suffers  so i think morality can be subjective, depending on the situation  

he argued that morality cannot be subjective, it must be objective and defined by the word of god (he is muslim, so through islam)  he said, if i don t subscribe to rules of religion, be default i subscribe to the fluctuating opinions of society on what is right or wrong  

what do you guys think about this  there are many religions, each claiming this is the correct way to connecting with god, however each have different processes of doing so  it is impossible to prove which one is the absolute truth, so why worry about it? i believe that our souls are divine and can connect to the god without any external institution, person, or material "

1,"applying stoicism to conflicts at work, looking for advice because i ve lost perspective  hello, how are you all?

i m trying to take stoicism to stressful conflicts at work because so far i ve handled things really poorly  i ve reacted and burnt many bridges, so to speak, and then i ve let everyone step on me trying to avoid conflict 

so, please, do you have any advice on handling with difficult people at work? 
what do you think it s the best stoic way? 

lately, any time there was some mean or rude comment i was telling myself  ""do i really need to freak out over this?   is there a real conflict here or is it just my ego?   if this person thinks i m whatever, let s look for the positive consequences of that"" and it started going very well, i was keeping my mood at work no matter what but then one day i exploded, not at work, but it was like i couldnt go to work anymore  i guess that instead of managing the situation i ve been repressing my emotions?
any suggestions, please? 

what i think it d be great is to go throught the day no matter what, like if i just could not get affected by people being mean or rude or jerks in general, and then forget about it, not taking anything personally, not respond to anybody, if a coworker says something rude, dont let this affect me but be able to do the decent thing and not return the insults, for example, behave the ""virtuous way"" instead of creating more conflict

1,"hedonic adaptation as a drug i was wondering is there any discussion about hedonic adaptation as being like a drug?  it seems based on what i've read that a new car, new prestigious school, new clothing, new promotion give a very short term burst of euphoria that is short lived  and i'm wondering can this be compared to like a drug in the sense that like thousands of years ago drugs were not ubiquitous and all those new things that give euphoria are new too  and the problem to me seems to be that many of these things that are suppose to make us happy aren't really relevant or very loosely correlated to long term financial independence and long term social connections  i'm just thinking in terms of observing for example dogs  like why buy a car unless there is someone to notice you having it  but a car won't force someone to be your life long friend  and like one can observe that there are animals like dogs that enjoy being petted so it seems to me the real problem is that most humans are designed to have a part of their happiness in close social connections  but the problem is that in the culture created by the capitalist system people are lacking reliable friends and so someone has to lose because relying only on family can't work (assuming they have a family) for everyone because just by probability someone will have something go wrong and be alone earlier than expected  so it seems to me that the focus on like winning at some basketball game to feel euphoria is like a grasp at getting attention in a world where very few are likely to give attention as a lifelong friend "

i have a lot of anger, hate and resentment for my family  a lot of things has happend and continue to happen between me and family, to give you an example of the kind of shit i have to go through the times i meet them, 

  during one occasion my brother wrote in the family group chat about how he needed help regarding some work (it would take the whole day) and asked me and my brothers if we were available on a specific date  when i explained that i wouldn t be available as i was working he wrote a long paragraph and started berating me that went something like this 

 you are worthless and untrustworthy  this is why nobody likes you and you have no friends  you never help the family     etc  

nobody in the group said anything or called him out, they just accepted it  and when i brought it up they told be to suck it up and it s okay because he is older  

  i asked my sister why she had told private things i had told her in confidence to a third party  she started yelling at me and said that i don t appreciate what she does for me until she stormed off 

  i returned my brothers car to him, which he had left at my mothers car  while in the car, the charger that he had left in the car was missing and he asked me where it was  i told him that i hadn t driven the car and didn t know  in response, he started yelling about how fucking tired he was of us and never listening to him while punching the cars glove compartment  it later turned out that the charger was in the glove
compartment of the car  

this is just three occasions but it s been like this my whole life (not just these two but from my other siblings as well) and continues today  it has resulted in me struggling with low self esteem much of my life, thinking i m stupid, not lovable, always the one in the wrong and made me accept unfair treatment from others 
it has resulted in me not want to be around the family and avoid them, i just feel a lot of anger and resentment for them, but i still want to be close to my mother and father as much as i can since they are old  

and i don t know how to balance this, every time i am around my family i am on edge and nervous 

the healthiest i have felt in my life is when i wasn t with the family or their influence ( especially my brothers) "

recently i've gotten into stoicism and ryan holiday mentions in his book the obstacle is the way that he recommends the inner citadel by pierre hadot  though, from what i've looked up, it appears to me that it functions as an interpretation of marcus aurelius his meditations? if so, then please confirm  if (partially) not so, then please correct and provide the answer to the following question  how would it further serve my learning of a stoic approach to life if i have already read the below

1,"completed 60 days of meditation for 1 hour day and it cut my anxiety away  i recently completed naval ravikant's recommended 60 days of meditation for 1 hour per day  i tried meditating before this for around 20 30 mins but never really felt that much benefit  so i started doing 1 hr  i tweeted about each day which kept me accountable and committed each day 

at first it was very difficult to sit still for that long  but after the first week, i started to truly realise that all of my problems were in my own head  i was perceiving things poorly, from past images that i'd clung onto 

reading wisdom from the main 3 stoic philosophers, jiddu krishnamurti and naval ravikant each day also helped to rewire my mind, giving me useful stuff to meditate on  i now realise that living in the past causes depression and living in the future causes anxiety  discovering for myself that this is true makes me almost unconsciously stay present   and i feel much better for it 

i am currently learning to code and as a practice project i made a meditation app that i am now using myself  it's based on doing 60 days of meditation, 1hr   day  at the beginning, only day 1 is unlocked  after meditating for at least 15 mins, the next day is unlocked  each day has some advice quotes from the philosophers i mentioned before 

complete a 30 min session to be awarded 1 star, 45 mins for 2 stars and 60 or more for 3 stars  there are bonus unlockable tao meditations for total stars and day streaks 

if anybody is interested in using this, i just put it on the play store  it's called ""60 days of meditation""

i didn't attend the wound quite well  i went to work early and forgot to change bandages  this bothers me 

one year later (still don't know if this was the cause or that it was on my shoulder blade which stretches the spot) i still have a large and mostly everyday itching scar 

for you it might sound like something unimportant but for me it's a daily nuisance reminding me of my illness 

i try to invert this feeling into something useful  as a reminder of mindfulness (""oh there's a itch""   and come back to the now) or as a reminder to now treat my body with the fullest respect because it reminds me that i didn't in the past  maybe even as a memento mori because it is a part of a medical condition  sometimes all of this doesn't work and i feel regret over my behavior

1,"getting blackmailed like a stoic i have desided not to pay ransoms demanded by a hacker group which has hijacked very sensible information from a weakly protected system of a psychotherapy center (vastaamo   finland) 

here are my initial thoughts 

i will not take any responsibility from any harm that this may cause to anyone  i will not appoligise anyone at any reason caused by this event  i'm a victim of a crime and i should be treated accordingly 

i refuse to comment any information, which have been leaked out  instead i have a right to feel beeing insulted and i will request polise to investigate if this person has violated any laws 

at first it appeared reasonable to pay   just to avoid problems in my life  but that would leave me worrying that these reports would be published anyway someday  the sooner i can face any consequences, the better  and what would be more humiliating than paying the ransoms and getting blackmailed again?

i believe that it will consume more time and energy to worry possible consequences that actually take the hit and deal with it 

i try not to consume my time and energy on any revenge fantasies  instead i will invest some time and energy finding a way to forgiveness as soon as possible 

i feel that there is potential to turn this misfortune into victory  instead of getting devastated and depressed, i will take this as a challenge  i will develope my abilities to keep moving forward while getting hit randomly  instead of getting embarrashed, i will take this as a challenge to build character 

i believe that there is a way to handle this so that the outcome would be nothing, but a stronger version of me  this is a possibility to learn  this is an opportunity to personal growth  

if leaked information will hit my human relationships so hard that this breaks my life, then i will build a new one  i have done that before and that's just life "

1,"preparing on the ""sunny"" day    i would appreciate any thoughts, suggestions, advice   just feedback in general would be appreciated    this post turned out to be lengthy, as most of mine in any sub do, but i would greatly appreciate some of you reading through my thoughts here and considering my ideas as they pertain to my family and providing any feedback or discourse 



i have sort of bottomed out recently  this month has been conducive to the hardest times of some of the overall hardest times for my sons and me 



i have not studied (and certainly not practiced) stoicism in earnest since the beginning of the month  it is usually a daily thing for me  i typically read and write a solid amount and find ways of implementing what i have been focusing on in my studies within our daily lives 



i, just today, found myself again immersed in this philosophy in a meaningful way  today i have been doing a lot of reading and writing and had largely avoided addressing the subject of preparing for the loss of things i fear to lose  at first, i skirted the issue, telling myself that i had only my children left to really lose because i spend every day hustling and fighting and scrambling to ensure we have the bare necessities for the next day  ""prepare for loss? go with less of something on purpose? i don't have time to even consider such things since i am fighting with everything i have just to prevent those losses "" plus, most of the time these types of lessons are worded in a way that says, ""prepare now,   while things are good  , for them to get worse"", and other variations on the same  in response to that wording, i have been focusing too much on how this is an unequivocally  not     good   time 



if i am real with myself, my family household (3 sons 13 and under and me) could do well to add regular instances of practiced gratitude for what we  do  have, no matter the thing's steep price (not strictly financially) right now  we could definitely benefit from incorporating conversing and or writing about anything at all that we are grateful for, but more substantially, we could significantly benefit from a regular   practice   



my sons are 13, 8, and 2  i do understand that the 2 year old needs to be considered carefully when implementing these practices, but i am also not thinking of anything extreme enough to cause any harm   just some annoyance and discomfort at first 



i am thinking of things like a night now and then where we pretend as if we do not have the luxury of having decent mattresses to sleep on, or no  hot water  electricity  wifi  tvs, tablets, phones, or  amazon echo with the alexa assistant  spices flavorful and diverse foods  access to excess toys  furniture  washer and dryer   and other little things that we are incredibly lucky to have access to today 



i think i would begin with the pretended loss of one thing at a time, as even one of those    while not actually harmful    could be a decent culture shock initially  my thinking is that stoicism just has so incredibly much to offer when considered carefully and sincerely and put into regular practice  this type of practice specifically would not only help with being grateful, it would help actually prepare for the real possibility of having to go without one or more of these things that i have fought so hard for but that i have misguidedly allowed my sons to take for granted because i have been thinking along the time old way that people typically do not want their kids to ever have to face the types of realities wants that they did growing up  



i know that of course, they deserve all of these things and more to be provided for them as children who had no say in their coming into existence  though, i want my sons to be so much stronger than i have ever been able to be  i want to avoid causing further trauma to them while building up their fortitude in healthy and productive ways  i want to help them by giving them the ability to deal well with the unexpected rather than spiraling as i ve tended to do 



in my reasoning, not only would such implemented practices help strengthen their mental emotional immune system when it comes to realizing how bad things could possibly get, but also how those things are not necessarily what's most important to have  i want them to be able to have time and opportunity and space created for them to flex their abilities to think critically and to look within themselves as well as to each other for sustenance pertaining to the ""soul"" 



putting such ""losses"" into practice and desensitizing them to things that seem utterly unthinkable now seem, to me, to have incredible potential for further familial bonding through getting creative and experiencing such significant events as a team  it seems like it would build new and strengthen established lines of trust  maybe it could bring out individual and group character traits involving rising up to take the lead in diverse situations, instilling in each of us a better understanding of our points of power and perhaps make us aware of certain weaknesses that we might not otherwise know to exist until it is too late to reach inward to evaluate, analyze, and plan for the betterment of  



one of the biggest things i focus on as a parent is open and honest, effective communication  with this practice, i think that in addition to everything i have just laid out my thought processes on, communication between us as a whole would benefit greatly "
1,"is stoicism about never sharing your emotions? my friend said to me today, my mum was an old stoic and never shared her emotions  i neve thought being stoic was like this, am i wrong? i hope so!"
1,"the four treasures of stoicism   what are the rewards of philosophy?     virtue may be defined as a habit of mind in harmony with reason and the order of nature  it has four parts  wisdom, justice, courage, temperance        cicero (as quoted by wikipedia)

with this you should be familiar already  often it is said that virtue is practiced for its own sake, or its own reward, but all i will add is that there are indeed rewards obtained from the practice  that is why i call them the four treasures as opposed to the virtues because they are rewards we can obtain, not just character traits to develop  they are valued and desired by everyone, but the path to get them is only crossed by the philosopher 

  wisdom begets the treasure of autonomy   

 gt as a wise and prudent person, you don't need to shepherded by holy men or tyrants  all you need to steer your life is with you at all times, from nature and experience, with an independent mind  you produce your own philosophy instead of relying on the account of others 

  justice brings the treasure of prosperity   

 gt only a just and fair man can have friends, family, and success in all business endeavours  society flourishes under the rule of such individuals  

  courage gives rise to the treasure of freedom   

 gt no one is a slave to anything but fear itself  if you can defy fear and stand against it, no master can make you tremble  only courage can break the chains that bind you to your station 

  temperance produces the treasure of sanity   

 gt many go astray not from a lack of reason, but from a lack of restraint  avoid excess and unnecessary abstinence, and nothing will remain far from you  your mind won't fester envy, hatred, nor anger towards anyone "

1,"nietzsche's attack on stoicism i've been reading nietzsche's  beyond good  amp  evil , and came across a chapter addressing stoicism, that i thought might be interesting to share and discuss 

 amp  x200b 

you want to  live  'according to nature'? o you noble stoics, what fradulent words! think of a being such as nature is, prodigal beyond measure, indifferent beyond measure, without aims or intentions, without mercy or justice, at once fruitful and barren and uncertain  think of indifference itself as a power   how  could  you live according to such indifference?

to live   is that not precisely wanting to be other than this nature? is living not valuating, preferring, being unjust, being limited, wanting to be different? and even if your imperative 'live according to nature' meant at bottom the same thing as 'live according to life'   how could you  not  do that?

why make a principle of what you yourselves are and must be?

the truth of it is, however, quite different  while you rapturously pose as deriving the canon of your lwa from nature, you want something quite the reverse of that, you strange actors and self deceivers!

your pride wants to prescribe your morality, your ideal, to nature, yes to nature itself, and incorporate them in it  you demand that nature should be nature 'according to the stoics' and would like to make all existence exist only after your own image   as a tremendous eternal glorification and universalisation of stoicism!

all your love of truth not withstanding, you have compelled yourselves for so long and with such persistence, and hypnotic ridigity to view nature  falsely , namely stoically, you are no longer capable of viewing it any other way   and some abysmal arrogance infects you at last with the bedlamite hope that,  because  you know how to tyrannise over yourselves   stoicism is self tyranny   nature too can be tyrannised over  for is the stoic not a  piece  of nature?

but this is an old and never ending story  what formerly happened with the stoics still happens today as soon as a philosophy begins to believe in itself  it always creates the world in its own image, it cannot do otherwise  philosophy is this tyrannical drive itself, the most spiritual will to power, to 'creation of the world', to  causa prima  

 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

personally, i can understand his argument regarding the imperative of ""live according to nature"", as stoicism revolves around suppressing negative emotions, thoughts and feelings, which are, at the end of the day, natural inclinations   


i disagree with the part about stoics trying to make all existence after their own image  i think stoicism is very personal and practical, and advocates not trying to force your beliefs onto others (theres a quotation from senenca about neither hating nor imitating the world   but just trying to be your own person) "

1,"i was cut out of my friend's lives a year ago because of something i did that i'm not proud of  it feels like they've died  how would a stoic handle this? just over a year ago i did something i'm not proud of  i won't get into it, but turns out i'm an addict and it spiraled out of control  my family found out, my friends found out and my wife found out as i was humiliated publicly on social media for what i did  my life was turned upside down and i don't wish it upon anyone 

i lost friends i had for over 25 years  these were guys that were in my wedding  since then they haven't reached out, and one of them (my best man) revoked my wedding invitation  they haven't spoken to me since  my wife and family told me that if they were there when things were easy and immediately headed for the exit when things went to shit, they weren't true friends  

i feel like they've died  i cried and mourned for months  it felt like a part of my identity was shattered 

fast forward a year later, my wife and family have stuck by my side  i've received professional help and have been in recovery since  it has not been easy by any means, but i'm still going day by day and managing the best i can for myself and my family  i have reconnected with old friends and made a couple new friends, but it's not the same  the relationships i had with those guys   or so i thought   felt like home 

how would you guys   a stoic handle this situation? i still have dreams multiple nights a week about seeing them and hanging out with them  i just don't know what to do  any advice at all to help change my perspective or help in general would be so appreciated "
1,"""a man's merits can never compensate for his faults""   machiavelli (discourses on livy) inb4 jokes on you, i have no merit posts  lol 

for those who read machiavelli in the pass or are only familiar with  his much more famous short book ""the prince"", you may be interested in checking out his other work on the best way to govern men and conduct the affairs of society   

lots of stoicism buried in the pages and this work comes off much better  i understand the ""the prince"" was basically a giant job application for the author seeking the employment of the medici family patriarch  within this context, it places the prince in better light but still falls short compared to this other more comprehensive work   

he pretty much was a fanboy of rome but goes to great lengths analyzing the good and bad decisions they made througout their history   if you a fan of rome, must read, and if your a philosopher king then should read "

what is it going to get them? how much are you going to care about the good grades you got all those years ago? how much will your parents and teachers care? do your employers care? is there no option for an adult who didn't do a good job?

1,"should i move? i am graduating high school in the middle of november  soon after, i will be staying at my dads house interstate for a month, then, i will decide whether i wish to live with him or stay where i am  i have to decide before january whether i shall move or not because i plan to study at tafe (technical and further education institution) to which i must entroll by january  so i must know where i want to live so i can enrol into the appropriate tafe, and i believe it will begin in march or something  

i wish to move because i prefer where my dad lives (which is where i grew up, and lived before my parents split), because i don t have the best relationship with my mum or her partner  although it has been getting better lately, i also struggle because my mum has a baby and a toddler with her boyfriend  the house is always really noisy, and there are regular dramas (often between my mums partner and my 13 year old brother  i do like this city, and i have made a couple of friends which i do value, however i prefer my old city, not only because the rest of my family lives there but i generally prefer the city itself  

earlier on i was very keen to move  but now, i am a little unsure because i will miss my friends and my siblings and mother  though, i do realise that not matter what choice we make in life we must sacrifice something and it s about what we wish to sacrifice in order to reach a certain end  i find myself thinking about it when i should be focusing about the present  but i try to picture if i will be happier living with my dad to staying here  if i wish to stay here, i ll have to put up with the challenges at the household and not seeing my family until i can afford to move out, which houses aren t cheap here so i would need a full time job in order to rent somewhere which won t happen anytime soon   

do you have any advice about this?"
1,"teenager confused about how i'm feeling male, 18, been following stoic practices for a while and this year my life has seen great change from shifting my mindset in many ways  i do journal and exersise and do all the basic 'sharpening the saw' activities  my queries are numbered so it helps discern where they start and end  )

  1)   however, after a few weeks of grinding, be it school, work, body or learning things etc  i always end up with some kind of mental blockages  a few months ago i started obsessing over my body and flaws, then later on i became a little paranoid about how much i know compared to my peers and as of late, i cannot get over this weird fomo i have  

  2)   i ran into friends from my old school the other day and this might have furthered these feelings  i don't really hang out with people and the last good, real friends i had were these bunch of boys from my old high school  it's been almost two years since we went to school together but i still love them and seeing them was nice  the fomo is more to do with maybe seeing this place n a book of video, then thinking about how nice it would be if i could take the girl i love or even the boys to this place and just be humans together  specifically that small fantasy has been crossing my mind lately 

  3)   i don't time on social media but lately my youtube consumption has gotten a bit worse and it kind of happened in the background without my knowledge  before i knew it, it's been two weeks of consuming youtube morning and night, right around my sleeping times which can't be good for me  this further intensifies these feelings as i see all these people online that i connect with and whom i'd love to be friends with  for example the other day i watched joe rogans conversation with matthew mcconaughey and i really felt like wow, what a great man, wish i was friends with him!

  4)   on top of this, recently i started work (as in a part time job) and it's become a new challenge to complete school work and exercise and do all those things  especially exercise i've been slacking just this past week 

if you read this far thank you  perhaps i just need to journal more, i haven't written in my journal for the past two days  but journaling only helps get my feelings on the page, but still leaves me confused on how to solve them

he has exploded in anger at me a few times over the months, and i manage to defuse the situation  i prefer to maintain a ""live and let live"" approach, i e  he is entitled to his views, and i am entitled to mine  i think he manages to repress his anger most of the time but once in a while it bubbles out and an argument seems on the horizon  since this pandemic began and we disagreed, although i managed to avoid arguments, he seems to be somewhat resentful and his previous genuine affection for me has dissipated  if i didn't make an effort to talk to him we could go weeks without talking, he is uninterested and aloof around me  i questioned him over this and he said there is a ""rift"" between us regarding covid and began to initiate the familiar ""you're not doing enough for the family"" spiel 

i managed to escape to process my thoughts, went for a walk, and came back to him glued to the tv, indifferent  it didn't used to be like this, but 6 months later, i am trying to come to terms with the fact that this behaviour might not change  how do i deal with this situation in a stoic way? it pains me to think he doesn't care any more, so i am trying to accept it  we have drifted apart, the subconscious genuine affection has gone "

1,"whenever you find yourself upset, pay close attention to what false appearance expectation you had that led to the discomfort  this is how you grow as a stoic  stoics believe that every distress that we encounter, however minor or major, is caused by a poor expectation or assumption that we made  to become unconquerable, then, is to forsake the perceptions that society teaches you, to not assume that a person will act in such a way, and to not make any expectations about what the future holds  this is how socrates openly welcomed a death sentence  this is how epictetus dealt with being enslaved and crippled with such equanimity  this is how a stoic becomes invincible  

upset that you broke your leg? did you expect your leg to be unbreakable? why are you so convinced that a broken leg is a bad thing? 

angry that you lost your job? why did you assume that it was in your power to keep it? you do not control the economy, the industry you work in, or your boss, so why did you think you controlled whether or not you stayed employed there?

sad that a loved one died? who told you that they would live forever? how could you not see it coming? for everyone and everything dies eventually  

i should add that it is okay, and natural to  feel  things when things happen  what i am talking about here is you ruminating, dwelling, wallowing, and otherwise playing the ""woe is me"" card for days on end     feeling      an emotion is a natural, momentary, human response that is more or less inevitable       thinking      an emotion is an intentional choice, and oftentimes an unnecessary reaction to something after the initial feeling has subsided

i was studying some things and this quote popped into my head and thought, hmm kind of stoic  i m reading a guide to the good life and in the first chapter the author talks about hedonic adaptation, negative visualization and how we take things for granted  

well, i think that quote goes hand in hand with that thought  one of the exercises of negative visualization is realizing you could die in a moment, and that most of the time because we don t acknowledge that we just idle and lose a lot of time

1,"how to understand evil 
whenever you see somebody do something hurtful, negative, cruel or evil to another or yourself always remember this 

no one is born as simply good  everyone, without exception, has the capacity to commit the greatest evil  similarly, everyone has the capacity to commit the greatest good  

evil, by its very nature, comes easy and natural  we are born as an individual and thus instinctively seek to maintain our self preservation and our own self interest  it is only when we interact with others, begin to form bonds and relationships outside ourselves, we begin to learn that humans can live for each other  some are not fortunate to be able to learn this and so are still driven by their basic instinct of self interest 

in the same way we have to learn to work and connect with others, we must constantly work towards the good  being good, being kind requires forethought, intention and effort  and sometimes for every good act, there may be multiple evil acts which occur  

so do not consider yourself better than your fellow human because you are doing good  you are simply more experienced, more learned and even then you still constantly make mistakes "

1,"is there another piece to the equation? stoicism doesn't seem to lead to self actualization  hi,

i would expect that most of us are familiar with abraham maslow's hierarchy of needs   here is a nice article if not   

the pyramid suggests that we have basic needs of food, water, and security and then psychological needs for belongingness and esteem   maslow categorized these needs as ""d needs""   if we didn't have these things, we would feel their deficiency 

the apex and fifth layer of the traditional pyramid says that after our d needs are mostly satisfied, then we strive for self actualization  once you start to ""feed"" self actualization, once you start to realize it, then the more that you crave it   the idea of self actualization is that, ""what a man can be, he must be ""

in my view, maslow's hierarchy of needs is directionally accurate   meaning, he's mostly right   that's mostly the order that most people experience life, making exceptions that people in their individual life's can jump around the layers to an extent   

which then leads to stoicism  stoicism is appealing because it provides a logical framework to address life   i am going to extremely simplify it  

1  what is your ultimate purpose?  harmony with nature, pursuit of virtue excellence arete, etc 
2  is your passion or desire in line with your purpose? we exercise control of our passions  
3  are your thoughts, beliefs, and value judgments virtuous or vicious? 

you apply this framework systematically across your life, meditating on what is virtuous and motivating yourself towards virtuous action  how can i be a better husband, father, co worker, and citizen of the cosmos?  while in theory your action towards being a better citizen of the cosmos may lead to self actualization, i am not sure that stoicism really embraces that concept   in other words, stoicism is about being content with regards to your ""d needs"", as maslow says, but not specifically about self actualization  

what about those passions that lead to self actualization that are virtuous but out of your control? true entrepreneurs have a driving passion to create a business despite many of the factors for success being almost completely out of their control  people have a drive to lead, manage and coach others, not out of a sense of ego or pride, but because they truly have that ""calling"" within themselves to help better other people   people have ""callings"" towards serving country or being a police officer   are these passions that should be controlled?  are these not healthy drives towards self actualization? 

has anyone found a combination of stoicism to satisfy your ""d needs"" and something else to help define our need for self actualization?  are how has stoicism helped you self actualize?

i appreciate your thoughts "

my question is on friends    what standard to have for friends? should we be able to interact normally with people who don't meet those standards? should i have ended this friendship    was i wrong to confide in an ex about another relationship    or rather should i give this person more latitude because of our history?"

if you can keep your head when all about you   
    are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   
if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
    but make allowance for their doubting too    
if you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
    or being lied about, don t deal in lies,
or being hated, don t give way to hating,
    and yet don t look too good, nor talk too wise 

if you can dream and not make dreams your master    
    if you can think and not make thoughts your aim    
if you can meet with triumph and disaster
    and treat those two impostors just the same    
if you can bear to hear the truth you ve spoken
    twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
    and stoop and build  em up with worn out tools 

if you can make one heap of all your winnings
    and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss,
and lose, and start again at your beginnings
    and never breathe a word about your loss 
if you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
    to serve your turn long after they are gone,   
and so hold on when there is nothing in you
    except the will which says to them   hold on! 

if you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   
    or walk with kings nor lose the common touch,
if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
    if all men count with you, but none too much 
if you can fill the unforgiving minute
    with sixty seconds  worth of distance run,

1,"i find myself obsessive over negative thoughts past experiences daily 
i find myself thinking about negative past experiences, what i could have changed, how people perceive me  daily  lots of times 

i catch myself and think, why are you still thinking about this thing that happened years ago  move on! be happy and present 

but the loop continues  

do i need to accept that i will never be able to erase these thoughts? it isn t like someone can go into my brain and select this and this then move to trash  

if so, how exactly do i live with these? how do i make peace with them? how do i forgive myself and others? how do i just live for today and try the best i can in life?

i meditate every day and keep a healthy routine but i struggle with this still 

i ve got so much going for me but i m stuck in this identity of who i was in the past and the bad experiences  i m not that person but i can t break out of it 

if anyone has advice i d really appreciate it"

1,which principles of stoicism are misconstrued by most? 
1,"living every day as if it were your last doesn't seem like a good idea i'm confused by the ""live every day as if it were your last"" advice  if this were my last day and i knew it, i would give a lot of my stuff away, eat too much, drink too much, not go to work, maybe throw a party, definitely not bother to floss  it seems like a recipe for a self destructive and imprudent life 

i'm assuming that this is a misinterpretation  the stoic philosophers were smart people, and they didn't generally live in an imprudent and self destructive manner   quite the opposite 

so how do i interpret this advice in a way that makes more sense?"

or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,
or being hated don't give way to hating,
and yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise

if you can think   and not make thoughts your aim,
if you can meet with triumph and disaster

if you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,

and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss,
and lose, and start again at your beginnings,
and never breathe a word about your loss 
if you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
to serve your turn long after they are gone,
and so hold on when there is nothing in you
except the will which says to them  'hold on! '

if you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
or walk with kings   nor lose the common touch,

i write stoic advice to people who contact me and i think that this one in particular may help new users of this sub to understand how the stoics perceived misfortune  you guys really liked my last post  understanding fear  amp  anxiety ( i hope you'll like this one too!

                                                                      


  question    i have a deaf brother and two deaf parents but i can hear  sometimes i am keenly aware of how isolating it is to be deaf  it saddens me that they are excluded from the experience of hearing and the benefits that come from being able to hear (namely, social   deaf people are oftentimes restricted to quality connections with other deaf people   blind people are arguably not as isolated), despite the fact that they try their best in life and seem more or less happy  they are solid and strong people and always wanted the best for me 
 
i think deep down i always felt guilty about this growing up  for instance, i do not think my brother has much of a social life (introvert, always on the computer), and so when i return home from social events, i feel guilty and feel like i will need to take care of them  and i do, i look out for them  but i wonder about these things in a way that makes me suffer inside needlessly  
 
please help me see my situation in a better light 


  answer    speaking as an introvert with a very social family, i find that their concerns regarding my isolation to be mostly fictitious  i have fewer friends than the average person, but i do not suffer from the desire for a plethora of friends, as an extrovert would  thus, my family views me unfortunate for my lack of connections, and i feel fortunate for the few good people i do have near to me  it is wise that you have structured your statement thus  i do not think my brother has much of a social life , have you considered that communication is far easier with those online? and that he is differently treated when he leaves the house? many people try to help or be empathetic to those with disabilities, but those with disabilities typically just want to be treated as normal individuals  online spaces eliminate social problems like this, people are not judged upon their abilities or appearances, it simplifies a task that is difficult for many people  and who are we to say that these connections are not as real as the connections built in real life?

you have also not considered that the curse of deafness is only apparent to those who can hear or who did hear, you are saddened that they cannot hear because you can hear  if they have not had this experience, then how are they to mourn something they have not lost in the first place? would you mourn that you shall never see a flower, having never seen a flower? it is they who have all that may lose all, the more one possesses, the more subject to loss he is  shall you weep for a man that shall never lose his sight? then do not weep for your family, for they cannot have lost what they did not have  if i am mistaken, and one or more of them had sight at one point, tell me who told you that you were entitled to keep your sensing faculties for all your life? do you not see elders deteriorating? do you not see their minds becoming slower? their limbs frail? their eyes darken? what in life guarantees a man that he should not lose his senses? will you live your whole life not considered that your eyes shall not be taken? your legs? your arms? shall you engage in a world of various dangers and not consider the possibility of loss?

there is little in life that cannot be seized from you by fortune, for what fortune gives, it has a habit of taking back eventually  your body is subject to fate, as is your mind  there are no guarantees against reckless drivers who cripple you, or freak accidents which leave you mentally handicapped  so if you place great value in your ability to run, becoming crippled shall be all the more difficult, and if you place great value in anything else, that may be taken from you, then you shall be all the more grieved should it be taken  you must view people and things as transitory, your family shall be gone one day, and there is a chance you shall not be alive to see it  these appear as terrible things, horrible realities which plague us, but they are not  those who accept reality on its own terms live better lives, and waste less time, for we who know the nature of life do not procrastinate that which is most important  as epictetus said,

 gt   the will of nature may be learned from those things in which we don't distinguish from each other  for example, when our neighbor's boy breaks a cup, or the like, we are presently ready to say, ""these things will happen "" be assured, then, that when your own cup likewise is broken, you ought to be affected just as when another's cup was broken  apply this in like manner to greater things  is the child or wife of another dead? there is no one who would not say, ""this is a human accident "" but if anyone's own child happens to die, it is presently, ""alas i how wretched am i!"" but it should be remembered how we are affected in hearing the same thing concerning others   

nothing is guaranteed by fortune except this  that you are able to choose how to react to fortune  fortune may take your money, your home, your family, but it is your choice how you may treat these grievances, it is within your ability to accept these and move on  it is within your ability to be greatly insulted and feel no hatred for the insulter  you are ever the master of your choices and actions, and should you not surrender your intentions and actions to the whims of emotion, you shall be free and at peace with all happenings 

your family is not deprived of anything that makes a life worth living, for would it not be a cruel world in which to live if one must be able to hear or see or smell to have a good life? we mourn all those who shall never see the sun rise or set, yet they cannot mourn this with the same acuteness that we can, for we have seen the beauty of the sun, and understand better what others have been deprived of  yet you treat these senses as though they were all that life is made of, and you forget the joy brought by another person's love, the tender caress of someone close to you, the excitement of achievement, especially against something as difficult as a disability  you forget that there are those who live life deprived of family, of love, of joy, of camaraderie, yet it is your choice to weep for the hearing of your family instead of celebrating the many gifts they have  every man, no matter how plagued by difficulties, has some good fortune afforded to him  so if one chooses to mourn his losses he must also proportionately care for what he does have while it is not yet lost to him  he must view every possession with equal fervor, and in seeing these things depart from him, he must recall that these things have not fully left him, as their impression remains upon him  as seneca says,

 gt   has it then all been for nothing that you have had such a friend? during so many years, amid such close associations, after such intimate communion of personal interests, has nothing been accomplished? do you bury friendship along with a friend? and why lament having lost him, if it be of no avail to have possessed him?   believe me, a great part of those we have loved, though chance has removed their persons, still abides with us    the past is ours, and there is nothing more secure for us than that which has been   

we are formed by those around us, and the loss of them sweetens the memories of them, what can be taken from us that we cannot be more grateful for in retrospect? and what would that thing be if could not have been taken? does not the passing nature of things also make them sweeter and more dear to us? does not the transitory nature of that which surrounds us make us more careful about how we use our limited time? is there anything which you would treasure if it was yours for a thousand years? no  possession of something for a long time dulls us to it, and it is the loss of that which we have had for so long which rekindles our passion for it, and reminds us that we are not guaranteed anything, reminds us that we ought to care for things now, not later  as epictetus states in discourses 3 24,

 gt    as to something brittle as glass or earthenware  that when it happens to be broken, you may not lose your self command  so here, too, when you embrace your child, or your brother, or your friend, never yield yourself wholly to the fair semblance, nor let the passion pass into excess  but curb it, restrain it,   like those who stand behind triumphant victors, and remind them that they are men  do you likewise remind yourself that you love what is mortal  that you love what is not your own  it is allowed you for the present, not irrevocably, nor forever  but as a fig, or a bunch of grapes, in the appointed season  if you long for these in winter, you are foolish  so, if you long for your son, or your friend, when you cannot have him, remember that you are wishing for figs in winter  for as winter is to a fig, so is every accident in the universe to those things with which it interferes  in the next place, whatever objects give you pleasure, call before yourself the opposite images  what harm is there, while you kiss your child, in saying softly, ""tomorrow you may die   "" and so to your friend, "" tomorrow either you or i may go away, and we may see each other no more ""?  

i believe it follows that your guilt is unwarranted and unfair  that guilt which you suffer is the product of ruminating upon that which your family does not have, and how they may be deprived of some things in life  yet everyone is deprived of something in life, and many a man would trade his depression or anxiety for one of his senses  happiness is not found in any one of life's grand offerings, but in the ones that we are able to treasure  yet how many men refuse to value their sight and hearing on a daily basis? how many men forget what they have and are made miserable by what they seek out?

man s curses of misfortune are self inflicted, one needs only see that good fortune is not guaranteed, and he shall never be troubled by fortune again  indeed, it is the man who rolls the die with expectations of winning who is disappointed when he loses  the man who rolls the die with no expectation is grateful for winning, and unsurprised by losing

1,"stoicism for a better life   weekly exercise (october 21) hello there, 

for this week s exercise, let us once again look to marcus aurelius' meditations, which he wrote himself to keep disciplined in his own stoic practices  this is vii 56 57 

 gt ""think of the life you have lived until now as over and, as a dead man, see what's left as a bonus and live it according to nature  love the hand that fate deals you and play it as your own, for what could be more fitting?""  

this is such a powerful thought and exercise  i try and incorporate this into my daily morning routine to ensure i begin my day with the right perspective  we have an irrational fear of acknowledging our own mortality  in fact, we tend to harbour a lot of anxieties regarding our impermanence and we let these ideas fester in the recesses of our minds where we shove unwanted thoughts and feelings 

however, reflecting on mortality (which is 100  guaranteed) in a logical and rational manner often has the opposite effect of what you would expect  instead of a sombre nihilistic sadness, one can find cosmic perspective, motivation and invigoration to make the most of our limited temporal time here  this is precisely what marcus aurelius is referring to in the above quote and the reason why the topic of death permeates the stoic school of thought 

  so as a practical exercise this week, try and reflect on your inevitable and unavoidable death    it may be uncomfortable at first, but try and embrace the fact that you are on a very short journey, and soon you will die  the goal of the exercise    truly embrace the value of your time and use it the way such a valuable resource deserves to be used   

as always, if you want to keep the conversation going, just reach out  you guys have a great week

1,"i would like to know your opinion about this i would like to know your opinion about some thoughts i had today while studying more about stoicism  beforehand , i would like to clarify that is just an opinion and is not meant to be as criticisms towards stoicism  in fact, i m trying really to live according to what they consider virtues in life in order to  be happier , as i find them honorable  

the thing is that i m starting to find this philosophy of life a bit idealistic   i think that the concept of a virtuous life and living according to nature is beautiful and honorable  however, to think that humans are able to live not falling into vice i think is quite impossible if we start from the fact that we live in a system that is totally out of harmony with nature and its natural order  
for this reason our rational capacity is perhaps syntonized with the broken system we live in  
we are constantly exposed to messages selling us the image that for example  what causes pleasure is the goal  i mean,the purpose would be what make us feel, the sensation  the provoked sensation can be bad or good but this mustn t be the goal or focus  otherwise, i can create  a dependency and if that s the case it would be linked again to the intemperance vice, so is not virtuous 

maybe it sounds like a conspiracy but i think the virtues ( wisdom, justice, courage,  amp  moderation) are shown in a way that we humans  focus on the  effects of it  and following this path, we just end up living more according to vices  

i would like to know your opinion about this and if you believe is actually possible to live fully according to this philosophy or if is just to apply it more in a flexible way  

my first language is not english, my apologies if there is any mistake or if my idea is not clear enough "
1,"what would your stoic response be in this situation?    please keep in mind that i am a padawan of the stoic philosophy   

you have an important doctor's appointment at 4pm  you are missing work for this appointment but it is important because it deals with your health 

you arrive early to your appointment and are seated in the examination room only to be waiting there for an entire hour before the nurse shows up   where she first asks what i am being seen for today 

as a student of the stoic philosophy, i know that i need to control only what i can actually control in this situation   my perspective on the situation  i cannot assume that the doctor was being lazy and that is why he is late  speculation like that leads to irrational anger and does nobody any good 

that being said, it is taught in stoicism that we are supposed to do what we can (within our control) to help our community practice virtue   and therefore live more fulfilling lives 

  in light of the previous sentence, wouldn't it be within the philosophical practice to make the medical staff aware that this sort of thing wastes time that i cannot get back? if i do not tell them, this could be affecting other, more seriously ill patients, who need to be seen more quickly   

i smiled and accepted the fact that the doctor was so late but i am trying to figure out if that was the more stoic thing to do "

1,"just running errands  purpose, satisfaction, and indifference  gt  the point of the stoics was that a thing may serve to give direction to action without being an object of desire  this is obviously true  supposing you are a servant, sent to fetch a parcel from the post office for your employer  you may be perfectly indifferent as to whether the parcel has arrived or not, yet your whole action in going to the post office, all the consecutive movements of your feet, will be directed by an intention  but if you found that the parcel was not there, you would not be disappointed, and rest satisfied with having fulfilled your part of the business  that is a type of the attitude of the stoic wise man towards outward things  (edwyn bevin,  stoics and sceptics , qtd  in  the meditations , trans  g m a grube)

anyway today we set up a time to chat for us to chat for an hour (prompted by me btw) and as we did she was constantly on her phone responding to people s snaps during our conversation  i didn t even look at my phone to see if j got any notifications 

what would be the stoic way to approach this problem? should i call her out on it? should i tell her that next time she s gotta make plans? i can only control what i do but idk if letting it go of this is a good idea, i want her to know my displeasure

1,"do you think our world as a whole is actually is based on irrational, non stoic ideas? if so, how do you deal with it? i've been practising stoicism for a long time, approximately ten years, even though my involvement in this subreddit is much, much more recent 

stoicism has helped and is still helping me a lot but over these years i've come to realise how distant stoic values are from the ones all of us  are  bombarded with every day  i feel like i am living in a world where rationality has actually no place and the nature of our relationships seems to be purely predatory or opportunistic at times, especially when money and or status are involved, whether explicitly and not 

i've been mulling over how to conciliate my stoic practise and beliefs with the external attempts trying to prove that they are completely wrong or even downright irrational  what  i've been wondering is whether you have ever experienced such feelings since starting your stoic practise and  how you would deal or come to terms with this understanding

1,"waiting what do you do when you feel like you have no control over what is happening around you? do you worry, or do you accept your fate? or something in between?

a few months ago i was in a saigon coffee shop chatting with my computer scientist friend long and my writer friend reece  reece is from new york originally, but has made vietnam his new home  we had been friends for many years, and tried to meet at least once every two weeks  i had just introduced long to him, and we were talking about technology, a bit of philosophy, a bit of teaching, but the topic that dominated most of our conversation, just like all other conversations at the time, was the unfolding pandemic 

 we had to interrupt the classes  it s not good  we were preparing for the exams in a few months, so now i don t know what we are going to do  , said long with a pained expression on his face 

reece complemented   yeah, i am lucky that all my work is remote anyway, so it hasn t affected me much  

 do you guys feel we should just wait it out, and hope that things will get better soon? 

long raises his hand and twists it from side to side, the way vietnamese gesture for  no    cannot do that  we need to adapt  we don t know how long this will last  we need to make a plan and change the way we do things  i am very worried  and you two should be worried too  

 i think we shouldn t overreact  these crises happen in cycles, there s always a recession, or a stock market crash, and eventually everything goes back to what it was before  just ride the wave out, that s what i say  , stated reece confidently 

i had my own thoughts, but before i shared them i wanted to hear the position of each of them in more detail, to see if i could understand their context, where they are coming from  in my experience most of the time that people disagree is not because they hold diametrically opposing thoughts, but more because they started from different positions, and are seeing the same problem from their own perspective 

 so reece, don t you worry that if this turns out to be a more prolonged recession, work might start drying up? 

 yeah, i suppose there s that danger  but i have some money saved for eventualities like that, so i can just ride it out  

long interjects   you are assuming that it will get back to normal  but what if it doesn t? what if we reach a breaking point and everything changes in a way that we cannot predict now? 

 i don t think that s likely  besides, i have a couple of projects going on at the same time  if one gets cancelled, the one one will surely go through  

long didn t sound convinced  i turn to him and ask   long, what makes you so worried? 

 i worry for the exams, of course, but i also worry long term  we will have to cancel next term completely if the lockdown continues  

reece frowns, pulling his head backwards   you don t have a plan b, a way to adapt? maybe the university should be thinking of how they can change the curriculum, or teach remotely via video? 

 we don t have time, we have to act quickly  people need to know what is going to happen, they need certainty   responds long with measured words, but with his tone of voice betraying his hopelessness   what do you think? , he asks, turning to me 

this is a situation unprecedented in our lifetime  certainly we cannot act as if nothing is happening, and bury our heads in the sand  self deception is the enemy  we must have the courage to face things exactly as they are  but also to plunge ahead and make changes without due consideration is not wise  i have strong opinions about this as many times in my life i have been in situations where i had little control over what was happening around, and had to learn the hard way not to be impatient, but also to make the correct preparations to come out strong from the other side 

with these thoughts in my mind i say my piece 

 the rain will come in its own time  we cannot make it come, we have to wait for it  there is danger in the situation, so we need to be strong  but strength in the face of danger is not to rush impatiently, but to bid our time  if we are weak, in the face of danger we grow agitated, and don t have the patience to wait  

 waiting though is not simply hoping that things will change by themselves, without effort from our part  good waiting is when we have the certainty that we will reach our goal, without illusions, being honest about our situation  we have to know that all the pieces of the puzzle are in place, we have made our contribution, so all we can do now is wait  

 once we have all the facts, know we have done our best, have come to terms with reality, then we are prepared, and can wait and act with resolution and perseverance  when we are preparing the broth for ph  , we need to make sure we have all the ingredients  then when we start cooking, the broth will then be ready when it is ready, there s no use being anxious about it  

 that sounds very confucian   says reece with a small giggle  he knows me well 

 hmmm, you are right   nods long   rushing is rarely good  i think this is a time for us to think deep, make ourselves strong inside, and be prepared for what will come on the other side  

 wise words  i think my hunger is starting to make me feel impatient  let s make ourselves strong with some warm soup  "

 if you think that this would be a waste of time  please leave     
     i (right now) have no interest in anything(belly fire that thing which drives life as the motivation some kind of dream)   in fact i am just saying that i regret being born  regret having parents   so if u ask me what is the solution u propose to me i say either suicide or leave me in an island where i do whatever i want  

  now before you say go visit a doctor or seek help   
i have vented out to my parents    they understood myself and gave a solution  just leave it just do it    
give it time    you will understand eventually      

to clarify a couple of things   i am good boy  i am above average   i have skills and something u could enjoy being with me     

  recently i read a holy book    it said just surrender to god  it somehow landed on me i read it  it gave me a piece and peace of mind     so i decided well let's follow god   but then i have this small doubt that wether god even exists    

 i took famous people interviews and many of the instances of peers or people that i respect    
it indicated one thing   
      
     do what you like    put the heart to it   don't worry about failures     i understand this mentally but not whole heartedly

 also i asked recently about this whole hearted thing and a fellow stoic answered me to change my beliefs of myself(thanks for creating this community)   he said it is hard but u feel good if u do it genuinely     

 summary again
       do i really need the belly fire to do stuff?
     if yes then direct me how to do it   
     if no just put a simple reason   
   
as i said i understand mentally  the fellow stoic said but i didn't understand from my heart or the experience that makes me go ""aha that's what he was refering to""   
i am a follower  i follow anything whether i like it or not  (but getting online advice is a bit doubtful idk why again my beliefs)

i understand that the belly fire comes at some circumstances and also it should be tailored or sculpted by the required person   
but if you think u could give me some instructions pls provide   

last summary is there a way to handle this stoically   

literally u are awardable if u read thru this   thank you"
1,"key to a happy life  love something good and become good at what you love i have thought about what makes for a happy life and inspired by stoicism and aristoteles thoughts about what makes for a good life, i think i have found my take on it 

like the title say  find something good virtues that you love and that you can become competent in, it should align with your natural talents in other words 

for example, if you love the idea of teaching and have a talent for it, becoming a teacher could make you happy  on the other hand, if you love the idea of you teaching but have no talent at all for teaching, it will probably not make you happy  likewise if you are naturally gifted with teaching but hate the idea of teaching then it also have a lesser chance of making you happy   i think it also needs to be something that you know is virtues in your heart and mind  if you are talented and working with something that you know deep inside is unethical, you will probably not be happy either  of course, this concerns not only career choices but any role in life  father, wife etc and one has many roles simultaneously in life 

any thoughts on this? maybe i am stating something very obvious here but thought i'd share  )"
1,"stoicon, stoic week and ryan holiday fellow stoic proficientes

i had the opportunity to participate last saturday on stoicon virtual event  it was really amazing day, quite one for stoic endurance during  8 hours of very interesting presentations  i enjoyed very much the ones of donald robertson, john sellars, tim lebon (smrt), greg lopez, massimo pigliucci, and william irvine, and was also surprised by chuck chakrapani's presentation as well   i haven't heard about him before 

however, even though i knew he wasn't on the program   i would have enjoyed a presentation from ryan holiday on the matter  from him i get the most content on stoicism  i have read a few books from stoic presenters (donald robertson and massimo pigliucci), but ryan's writing is the one i enjoy the most, from his books (toitw, eite, sitk), his daily stoic emails and podcast, and i'm currently waiting for his new book lives of the stoics to arrive to my door 

i started as well last sunday to participate on stoic week, and have found a happy coincidence (?)  main theme for monday was progress, and main theme for today tuesday is happiness 

daily stoic emails podcast from monday centered as well on progress (it s about crossing one thing off after another), and from today on happiness also (if you want to feel better, do this) 

from the group of scholars, donald robertson it seems is the one most engages with ryan holiday, and vice versa, having praised his new book (ryan did the same with how to think like a roman emperor), and even promoting it on his twitter post from today 

i find it a happy coincidence as it's good that (casually) stoic week and daily stoic are discussing the same topics  hopefully we'll see tomorrow if such a coincidence still holds  )

1,marcus aurelius reconstruction (thought this was interesting) 
1,"thinking in terms of stoicism has helped me change what i have control over! first of all, i would like to thank this sub for existing  from the challenges to the examples through user posts, and the wiki, it's been useful 

i dove into mbti because i wanted to understand why i see the world differently  turned out i am a rare personality type, infj  we have tons of flaws and problems, our brains just don't work the way everyone else works  because we are so rare we are typically not given the correct nurture, and are left up to nature to develop  i too, ended up developing in odd ways, constantly tripping up and stumbling through crippling depression and failures in just general execution of life itself  the more i learned about myself, the more i became disappointed in who i am  i also fell into the trap of just accepting it  this is who i am, and i can't change 

then i found stoicism  the idea to just let go of what you can't control was pleasant, since my type uses intuition to constantly predict endless future possibilities of one's own life, falling into a loop of fear of losing control  then after i started letting go and investing less effort into what cannot be controlled, i turned my attention the opposite way  i took control of me  nature would no longer be the defining factor of my life  instead, if i had to nurture myself, then that is what i will do 

an infj to break it down, is someone who is introverted, intuitive, feeling, judging (not judgmental) 

we gain our energy from being alone, and i don't like that  i don't want to be cloistered up all the time  sure i enjoy my books, my documentaries, my endless dives into the pits of knowledge and wisdom where i can go days without remembering other's exist  i have slowly made an effort to go out every weekend and enjoy spending time with people and investing into maintaining some kind of friendships  i accepted the fact that 1) they are people and they can fail me, and 2) i may need time to myself from time to time  so now 1 weekend out of the month is for me, and 3 are spread amongst 3 different friend groups  most people can't even tell i am an introvert, and i don't feel like one either  

infj's are ""feelers"", people who have deep empathy and are usually very quick to rash emotions weather its anger, frustration, love, hate, happiness, etc  we connect and exacerbate emotions at light speed, making us sometimes do the irrational thing  thinker types are typically very logical and usually don't take up an emotion or a feeling without thinking about it first  through taking a stoic approach to everything that happens around me, i have limited how much emotional energy i expend, making me feel better, having more energy, and also not over investing into empathy (infj's are walking empaths)  instead i resort to thinking before feeling as much as i can, helping me to not over extend 

judging does not mean being judgmental  the opposite if perceiving  judging means carrying out judgement  perceiving means to wait and see before deciding  i am one of those types as you can probably tell that combining rash emotion with the natural need to making a decision now, is deadly  i tell my self to slow down, think, analyze, decide if i need to act now or later  a stoic approach helps filter out so many questions that before seemed necessary, but now, are pointless  there are so many things that i simply don't have the ability to change, let alone decide a course of action for  instead i have tried very hard to just wait, listen, observe  its very, very hard, but i am working on it because this is something i can change, the way i react 

and finally the part i skipped, intuition (n)  i have what some call, gut feeling, the third eye, a 6th sense  it's not perfectly accurate, but its darn close  scary close  the issue is when your body and mind start to depend on your perception of the invisible as your primary way of seeing the world  the opposite of intuition, is sensing, using your physical senses  this is the hardest thing to change  my mind simply does not see the world through physical eyes  behind everything that happens, my mind is trying to find patterns, read between the lines, analyze clues, and carry out judgment based on things not physically observable by someone who is an s type  the n type of person can often get stuck in this dark area where he relies so heavily on his 6th sense that he starts to make mistakes in his judgement  we use all of our previous experiences to create correlations and patterns to predict how someone will act, how they will think about us, treat us, if they are a threat or can we trust them  the only way to change this, is to stop caring about what people think about me  to stop worrying about how people will see me  the majority of the world is composed of s types anyway, who can't see through me like i see through them using intuition  i have also made it a priority to stop trying to see through people and chose to trust them based on some kind of warm fuzzy feeling in my gut  taking a cold logical approach, watch their actions  have people prove themselves by looking at physical things, their past actions, the way they treat the world around them  use my damn eyes for flips sake 

either way, i have begun a process of not giving into the nature i was given, and instead, adapt, overcome and evolve into a being that can rationally use all parts given to him by god  to not be limited to just what you were born with, but develop skills and habits that make me worry less, stress lest, and come to better, more efficient, and helpful decisions and conclusions  i may not be able to change others or some things in the world around me, but i sure as hell can work on myself 

tldr  i am an infj based on mbti testing  i have taken it with a stoic approach, i can change myself and those 4 letters don't define me anymore 

also, i know that i am no great stoic, and that i am not quoting tons of philosophers here to back up my points (although i have read meditations and letters)  sorry guys  also, no idea what flair i should make this, correct me if i am wrong "

1,"it's okay to die  from the beginning of human race, or even of earth, our last destination will always be death  so why we humans fear death if it's something inevitable? 

some people who fear death creates a make believe ideas like when they believe on something and die, they will go to some kind of paradise which as long as it makes you happy and less stressed about death, is okay 

but realistically wise we should not fear death, yet embrace it  as much as we welcome death anytime, we will be able to appreciate every seconds of life more   everything that matters will be more prioritized and we'll see things in a bigger perspective that if we leave this earth, you're gone, you're going to be part of the earth life cycle where you turn into dust and you'll be usable by plants and animals which are also be usable for humankind   

death should be treated like an honor that you finalized the continuous process of human life   

death is a proof that we are all equal with all living things, small or big  "

1,"memento mori and ""inferno""   mrs green apple thinking about memento mori while listening to music has made me realize how stoic this song is

here's the lyrics from the english cover from  natewantstobattle's youtube channel 

a light unto my darkening
illuminate the path
of old familiar days
now i stay content living a dream
anow there is no forever
i've been told we'll fade away
so laugh in every day you get
don't let it go to waste

so if your light is fading
from the shadow of a doubt
we'll light the sky
with our
inferno
we'll keep marching right until
our fire's burning outm i becoming lazy
living careless and free?

it's a light unto my darkening
what happened to the comfort
of the streets that we walked?
now the cold at time is
worse than it seems
but we can light a fire
and we'll fight it

now we can find a way
through the fire and the flames
now it's burning in my heart
just like a melody

now there is no forever
i've been told we'll fade away
so laugh in every day you get
don't let it go to waste

so if your light is fading
from the shadow of a doubt
we'll light the sky
with our
inferno
we'll keep marching right until
our fire's burning out

now at what point did we stop it all?
and now that you're not moving
you feel like you can't fall
but a still flame doesn't burn at all
we gotta keep the fire burning
hotter, hotter

i can taste it it's so close to me
but in the end you take your time
then it'll soon rot
though it might feel like
it's burning down
the scars you wear
remind you that you made it

then we'll evaporate
as we rise up to the sky
in my hands i will protect
these precious memories

as we're walking down this road
we'll look up and start to fly
you will never be alone
we work in harmony

now there is no forever
i've been told we'll fade away
so laugh in every day you get
don't let it go to waste

so if your light is fading
from the shadow of a doubt
we'll light the sky
with our
inferno
we'll keep marching right until
our fire's burning out

i'm not afraid
to keep the fight going
sometimes you keep on
feeling your pain
i saw the
fire in your eyes burn
stronger inside you now

burning brighter
every single day

there might be no forever now
so what we're bound
to burn and fade away?
so treasure every day
don't let it go to waste

so if your light is fading from
the shadow of a doubt
we'll light the sky
with our
inferno
we'll keep marching right until our
fire's burning out!

first it starts talking about how you could become lazy by not caring about anything and living the way you wanna live 

then it talks about change 

 gt it's a light unto my darkening what happened to the comfort of the streets that we walked? now the cold at time is worse than it seems but we can light a fire and we'll fight it 

so even if it seems like the cold in your life is unbearable, you still have to fight it don't let the sad in changing your life get over you 

 gt do what you will  even if you tear yourself apart, most people will continue doing the same things   marcus aurelius

then the next part is all about memento mori 

 gt now there is no forever i've been told we'll fade away so laugh in every day you get don't let it go to waste so if your light is fading from the shadow of a doubt we'll light the sky with our inferno we'll keep marching right until our fire's burning out

how even if there is no eternity you should not let your days be ruined by sadness 

 gt i'm not afraid to keep the fight going sometimes you keep on feeling your pain i saw the fire in your eyes burn stronger inside you now burning brighter every single day

here it shows that you should always keep on trying to live your best life, even if something really sad happens like the death of a close one you should always put on a fight and try to stay as calm as possible and if you can't do that on your own seek the help of others, stoicism is about helping others as well as this quote from marcus aurelius 

 gt acquire the habit of attending carefully to what is being said by another, and of entering, so far as possible, into the mind of the speaker 

 gt i can taste it it's so close to me but in the end you take your time then it'll soon rot though it might feel like it's burning down the scars you wear remind you that you made it 

this part reminds me of amor fati  all the scars that you have are proof that you made it out even stronger than before that your destiny gave you a problem and you proved yourself worthy of beating it 

 gt do not seek for things to happen the way you want them to  rather, wish that what happens happen the way it happens  then you will be happy   epictetus

1,"stuck in a loop of materialism  how do i find clarity of mind? i (m, mid twenties) try and read stoic philosophy as much as possible, and am a firm believer in it's messages  i know fully well that happiness cannot be found in materialism, however i notice myself constantly slipping back into the thought pattern that i'd be much happier with objects  

i am currently studying an engineering degree in surveying, so money isn't exactly flowing through me at the moment but that's ok, but maybe that's the reason i wish for more? i also come from a pretty well off family, and since moving out of home i've began to appreciate how hard one has to work to achieve a certain standard of living

1,"is seneca's approach to 'seizing the day' the same as horace's 'carpe diem? seneca said  ""the greatest obstacle to happiness is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow, and loses today  you are planning what lies in fortune s control and abandoning what lies in yours  begin to live at once, and treat each separate day as a separate life ""

horace's 'carpe diem' is often misinterpreted as something like nike's 'just do it!' however i think this is a better translation   ""pluck the day, for it is ripe, relying as little as possible on tomorrow ""

seneca and horace both agree on the importance of this day  but would they have done the same kind of thing on any particular day? my guess is that they probably differ somewhat in their understanding of this idea  could any of you who know the texts better than me explain the differences between these two men?"

some of these things could include comments on what they believe certain philosopher s views would be on victimhood from the pov of a stoic or how they should handle things such as sexual assault  should they play the victim or should they just move on and forget about it? is there any point in playing the victim? 

anything helps! even your own views on the topic will be interesting

all i seem to do is sit on my phone, researching my problems and talking to people about them  i have become abusive to my partner and emotionally shut off from those around me  i seem to resent people and assume they don't like me  i don't have the drive to do any actual hobbies, i'm becoming incredibly self obsessed and self indulgent  i pity myself for situations that i have put myself in, and i do nothing to fix them  i don't feel like i'm living in my life  i feel like i'm less mature than i was at 18  i talk about myself all the time and have days where i find it hard to think about anyone else  people have tried to help me but i'm set on 'fixing it myself' but after another day of lying in bed researching potential personality disorders i think this is getting ridiculous  my motivation to change seems to disappear so fast  i really dislike myself and don't understand how i'm in this place  the more aware i am of needing to stop acting in my ego the more i seem to do it  

i've bought many self help books but don't have the motivation to read them  i've started remote volunteering but am too lazy to contribute much  i promise my partner that i'll get better and communicate better but some days i struggle to connect with my own actions and his feelings  i'm in therapy but paying someone  40 to talk about myself again seems counterproductive  

i don't understand how i'm in this place at 24  i thought i would be in a happy relationship or living in france or volunteering with animals or learning how to make clothes but instead i've become a lazy self pitying directionless lump  even my 19 year old sister has told me to start acting my age  

anyone have any tips on how to grow up? i know stoicism is about acceptance and living by logic so i think that would help

it's a french roast vietnamese de lat and it tastes very much something the stoic philosophers would enjoy  it's very much free of the passions and pleasures and focuses on the rich flavor and the robust, smooth finish

buut these are outside things  i can't really control them but how i think about them  so from that perspective on it's good practice to keep the occasional pain by texting with her so that i have to deal with it and keep an eye on remaining virtuous  i also like to be there for people if there are problems and bringing happiness to them by spreading positivity and good vibes  

on the other hand though, it's really painful but as we know happiness comes from living a virtuous life  the question as well is if it this has even something to be with being virtuos is being nice and kind, helping others and not ""banning"" them out of your life virtuous? 

i feel like i am missing out on something in terms of me asking this question and of course in terms of the answer to this question  so what are your thoughts?

1,"the irony in stress i don't know if this has ever happened to you, but you are just minding your business waking up whenever you please and then suddenly one day you have an appointment or assignment or test or meeting and you need to be up slightly earlier than you usually wake up  you get into your bed slightly earlier than usual, read a book, shut off the light, then you cant sleep, no worries just open up your computer and watch a show, nice that was a good episode, time for another, holy fuck! it's 3 am, well i'm not tired so another episode, holy shit its almost 5 am, the daylight is starting to break and i have to be up in 3 hours, you put your head on the pillow and fight your thoughts preventing you from sleeping, you get angry at yourself for letting this happen, now you are stressed about the early wake up and how little sleep you will get and what that will do to you long term

in an alternative universe where you didn't have that appointment or assignment or test or meeting or whatever, you fell asleep exhausted at 1 am and woke up comfortably at 9am

this is where we are at with our thoughts, we procrastinate that project due or test we have to do, however if you would of just been on a schedule from the get go, or chewed away at the project much earlier you wouldn't be wasting time and wallowing in your own stress

 you might perhaps come across one here and there  of the mob who understand , but even they would need to be trained and developed by you to a point where they could grasp with your teaching   for whose benefit, then, did i learn it all?  if it was for your own benefit that you learnt it you have no car to fear that your trouble may have been wasted 

it s in this last sentence that my question arises   if it was for your own benefit that you learnt it you have no car to fear that your trouble may have been wasted   what does this mean?

at first glance i thought it meant  don t worry if no one understands you and your learning, it s for your own benefit you learn and grow in learning   but then seneca goes on to say in the next sentence   just to make sure that i have not been learning solely for my own benefit today, let me share with you three fine quotations

1,"practicing stoicism while working a phone bank  this weekend, i spent time working a phonebook encouraging people to vote in the u s  general election  cold calling others is a thrilling experience  there is no guarantee how a person will answer a call from an unknown number, and given the amount of spam calls people receive, frustration from their end is understandable  

to prepare for the experience, i reread from marcus aurelius   meditations  book ii, 1 

 when you wake up in the morning, tell yourself  the people i deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly  they are like this because they can t tell good from evil  but i have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine   

i ve admired this passage for how it lays out marcus  clear sightedness and compassion  he knows people can be difficult, and yet he remains committed to humanity  since we all share a common nature, there s no need to be upset at the slights and harshness of others  they are to be expected and not what binds us together 

that day, i listened to my fare share of frustration, anger, and curt hang ups  i also spoke to people who were excited to vote, to contribute in their way to the cosmopolis  my last call was with a woman over a hundred years old, who was grateful someone even called her at all 

it was a reminder as marcus would say that,

 we were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower   

teeth sometimes grind against each other  knuckles sometimes crack against the opposite hand  feet step on feet  and yet, through productive tension a practicing stoic like myself can center himself in equanimity and find a reminder of our common nature

  so, now my friends in this community,  all of you,  i will let you know how stoicism works out for me in future updates   so far i've been pretty chill  haven't had an exact diagnosis yet but this top surgeon said it doesn't look good    a year ago i would've freaked out  i used to drink alot  i quit drinking and turned to stoicism to replace my anxiety issues from drinking to stoic philosophy   and i'm doing great, people that know me are stunned how i'm handling it   i'll update as news comes in  because i might freak out in a week lol "
1,"sub suggestion  user flairs when someone asks a question here, many of the replies frequently have nothing to do with stoicism or are an inaccurate portrayal of it  unless you already have a solid understanding of the system it's easy to become misinformed  for a sub dedicated to spreading knowledge and , lack of quality control hinders that goal 

having user flairs to identify reliable community members would make it easier for new users to find info that is actually representative of stoic thought "
1,"is displaying anger when standing up for myself ok? i have been subject to some disrespectful emails from a colleague and i am wondering what stoicism advises in this circumstance? i will stand up for myself but i dont want to do that in a placid, neutral manner rather i think showing anger and emotion is useful but would be open to any advice?"
1,"being stoic vs being a pushover? i'm naturally ""stoic"" in a few ways  the simplest most trivial example is if a restaurant gets the order wrong  i'm not the person who will send it back, or demand credit for them making a mistake  plenty of people will get frustrated in the this situation, ask for the food to be remade, and in some scenarios will be angry if they're not given a free something or another  

but i've worked at a restaurant before, mistakes happen, and the last thing you want is an order to come back to add to the list of things you need to do  so i don't send things back (unless, you know, it's undercooked or something)

that's just one example, but each time this idea comes into my head, i can't help but feel like this is exactly how a ""pushover"" would act  a person who just takes whatever is given to them and never asserts themselves or speaks their mind, in a sense  i'm just wondering what your guys' thoughts are on this idea?"
1," you create opportunities by performing, not complaining     mickie siebert so this quote comes from the so called  first woman of finance ( as a bisexual woman survivor navigating life as a foreigner every day and code switching constantly across languages to keep up with the world around me, i'm exhausted a lot and have adopted   and adapted   a stoic praxis into my life  it's helped me respect myself, not to mentio overcome a whole fuck of a lot in life, from family scapegoating to rape and sexual assault (both inside and outside of said family) and gaslighting upon gaslighting upon gaslighting in an effort to troll and leverage my trust in my own mind and doubt my mental health and silence me about these things (which to clearly articulate, aren't complaints  they are abuses, and abuses are things the actual stoics themselves would not have advocated silence about, no matter how the philosophy is often bastardized today, particularly in corporate environments )

i do not disagree with this quote  indeed i agree with most of her points about ""professional"" success (though in my own case, most were hammered into me by an emotionally abusive ex)  this particular quote in full speaks more specifically to siebert's experiences as a woman trailblazer in her career, too 
 gt you create opportunities by performing, not complaining  there were no female role models, so i just blazed my own path  when i came to new york, i had five hundred dollars and a very used studebaker car 

mickie siebert never married or had kids (both coincidentally projects that i do not believe anyone should take on without a robust stoic mindfulness detachment praxis, but also projects that should not have anything to do with one's profession or career, regardless of gender)  she joined the nyse in 1967, and was privy to the  mad men  esque, romanticized hypermisogyny of that bygone era of the finance world in the 1970s and 80s 

i do not know if siebert herself  would have agreed with that keeping silent about physical and mental abuses based on gender is different from ""performing, not complaining"" ( but i do think her legacy and life philosophy are broadly aligned with stoicism  i also think that bucking what people who try to manage or control you want is an important part of developing a healthy relationship with stoic philosophy, and that things have gotten a lot better in a lot of places (and moreover, are a lot better in a lot of places that aren't the us)  

morally ethically i cannot condone siebert's career, finance (especially in the us) as a profession industry in general, nor the actions of wall street nyse but i have made my own choices that got me ahead in various ways while bucking convention as well, some that i regret and others that i am proud of  all speak to a nerve of steel that tends to intimidate people and a sense of self that's ultimately been stronger than that of most others i've met  

i'm interested in discussing with others who have faced active institutional oppression and or discrimination in life (as opposed to adversity, which everyone faces)  how have you all adapted stoic philosophy into a mindfulness praxis or some other framework to develop resilience and relinquish any illusion of control, while remaining firmly true to yourself and your legacy?"

i shrug  a lot  this is something my friends have pointed out to me over the years, but i've never stopped doing it   (i also use the shrug emoji a lot too ) something about the physical action, which as a human i have naturally associated with indifference, helps me actually achieve a higher degree of indifference  obviously, and i want to emphasize this, stoicism is not about 100  indifference all of the time  but in times where it is very beneficial to remain calm, cool, and collected, beginning my thought process with the physical act of shrugging does wonders to keep me centered

1,"are externals really not needed for a happy life?  in his book ""the happiness hypothesis""  jonathan haidt claims that in the modern word some externals are necessary too  

  when life is unpredictable and dangerous (as it was for the stoic philosophers, living under capricious roman emperors), it might be foolish to seek happiness by controlling one s external world  but now it is not  (full text below)

  when life is unpredictable and dangerous (as it was for the stoic philosophers, living under capricious roman emperors), it might be foolish to seek happiness by controlling one s external world  but now it is not    

  people living in wealthy democracies can set long term goals and expect to meet them    we are immunized against disease, sheltered from storms, and insured against fire, theft, and collision  for the first time in human history, most people (in wealthy countries) will live past the age of seventy and will not see any of their children die before them  although all of us will get unwanted surprises along the way, we ll adapt and cope with nearly all of them, and many of us will believe we are better off for having suffered  so to cut off all attachments, to shun the pleasures of sensuality and triumph in an effort to escape the pains of loss and defeat this now strikes me as an inappropriate response to the inevitable presence of some suffering in every life 

 amp  x200b 

many western thinkers have looked at the same afflictions as buddha sickness, aging, and mortality and come to a very different conclusion from his  through passionate attachments to people, goals, and pleasures, life must be lived to the fullest  i once heard a talk by the philosopher robert solomon, who directly challenged the philosophy of nonattachment as an affront to human nature 69 the life of cerebral reflection and emotional indifference (apatheia) advocated by many greek and roman philosophers and that of calm non striving advocated by buddha are lives designed to avoid passion, and a life without passion is not a human life  yes, attachments bring pain, but they also bring our greatest joys, and there is value in the very variation that the philosophers are trying to avoid  i was stunned to hear a philosopher reject so much of ancient philosophy, but i was also inspired in a way that i had never been as an undergraduate student of philosophy  i walked out of the lecture hall feeling that i wanted to do something then and there to embrace life  solomon s message was unorthodox in philosophy, but it is common in the work of romantic poets, novelists, and nature writers   we do not live but a quarter part of our life why do we not let on the flood raise the gates  amp  set our wheels in motion he that hath ears to hear let him hear  employ your senses   (henry david thoreau, 1851)

 amp  x200b 

even a future justice of the u s  supreme court a body devoted to reason issued this opinion   i think that, as life is action and passion, it is required of a man that he should share the passion and action of his time at peril of being judged not to have lived   (oliver wendell holmes, jr , 1884)71 buddha, lao tzu, and other sages of the east discovered a path to peace and tranquility, the path of letting go  they told us how to follow the path using meditation and stillness  millions of people in the west have followed, and although few, if any, have reached nirvana, many have found some degree of peace, happiness, and spiritual growth  so i do not mean to question the value or relevance of buddhism in the modern world, or the importance of working on yourself in an effort to find happiness  rather, i would like to suggest that the happiness hypothesis be extended for now into a yin yang formulation  happiness comes from within, and happiness comes from without  (in chapter 10, i ll suggest a further refinement of the hypothesis ) to live both the yin and the yang, we need guidance  buddha is history s most perceptive guide to the first half  he is a constant but gentle reminder of the yin of internal work  but i believe that the western ideal of action, striving, and passionate attachment is not as misguided as buddhism suggests  we just need some balance (from the east) and some specific guidance (from modern psychology) about what to strive for

1,"evening and morning routines hey fellow prokoptons!

what stoic practices people here do to bookend their days?

i ll share mine below, though i m always looking for ways to change and grow 

each night, i write in my journal, answering a version of sextus  and seneca s questions 

 amp  x200b 

  what did i do right?
  what could i have done better?
  what shall i do tomorrow?

for the last prompt, i look at what i could have done better and formulate my own question to ask myself the next day  for example, if i spent too much time telling stories about myself or trying to be overly clever (a chronic fault of mine), i ll write    ask yourself  who paid money to see you perform? is that why people are here, to be entertained by you?  

i then fall asleep and tell myself,  i have lived , considering the chance that i might not wake to see the morning 

if i do wake up (so far, so good), i read from three stoic texts i ve put in rotation  a page fram  the meditations , a chapter from  the enchiridion , or one of seneca s  letters  

then, i meditate for five minutes, usually interrogating my first thoughts of the day to attempt to figure out what i m bringing to my day and what s up to me or what isn t 

last, i review the question i set out for myself the night before ( ask yourself  who paid money to see you perform? is that why people are here, to be entertained by you?  ), and use it as a guiding focus for the day  

looking over all this, it seems like a lot  i m lucky to be an early riser, so i m usually awake before my wife and 11 month old daughter, and i fall asleep well after we tuck the little one in  

if i m keeping track of time, i d say each routine takes between fifteen to twenty minutes not counting the miscellaneous hygiene one does after waking and before sleeping 

what do you do? how could i make this better?

appreciatively,

1,"my favourite marcus aurelius quotes! hey! i've only recently read aurelius' meditations at the start of my journey into stoicism and it was awesome! everyone goes through times of anxiety and doubt and for me, looking back at a quote bank i made while reading his work has helped a lot! i hope it does the same for you  ) i've taken highlights from each of my categories to make it more digestable 

  general  

 disgraceful  for the soul to give up when the body is still going strong  

 to stop talking about what the good man is like, and just be one  

""value of attentiveness varies in proportion to its object  don't give small things more time than they deserve""

 how much more damage anger and grief do than the things that cause them  

  concering other people  

 that to expect bad people not to injure others is crazy  it s to ask the impossible  and to let them behave like that to other people but expect them to exempt you is arrogant the act of a tyrant  

 it never ceases to amaze me  we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own ""

  when something 'bad' happens to you  

""it s unfortunate that this has happened  no  it s fortunate that this has happened and i ve remained unharmed by it  not shattered by the present or frightened of the future  it could have happened to anyone  but not everyone could have remained unharmed by it "" 

  and finally    on procrastination (a little edited lol)  

at dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself   i have to go to work  as a human being  was i created to huddle under the blankets and stay warm? 

   but its nicer here  were you born to feel  nice ? instead of doing things and experiencing them? don t you see the plants, birds, ants and bees going about their tasks, putting the world in order as good as they can? and you're not willing to do your job as a human being? why aren t you running to do what your nature demands?

   but we have to sleep sometime  sure, but nature set a limit on that as it did eating, drinking, gaming  and you're over the limit  you ve had more than enough of that  but not of working, there you re still below your quota 
is helping others less valuable to you? not worth your effort?"

to keep this short, but not curt i'll cut straight to the chase with minor exposition  recently, i finally accepted my lifelong urging and decided to join the us military  (21 m) as a human being who spends many hours buried in books and even more hours laboring at the iron throne (gym) i was offered an option 40x contract    to put it simply, an option 40 puts me directly into the pipeline into the us army rangers  

while i understand that these next few years will be the hardest of my life    that doesn't phase me  i've looked down hundreds if not thousands of tough situations in my life and have applied the stoic principals to lead me through them all    what concerns me is this thought of death and how i'll react to it 

how can i prepare myself for this elevated likelihood of death? when i train, i train until i can't move    but i know i won't die  when i begin my training with live rounds, explosives, and eventually real combat, how can i prepare myself for this mentally? 

  how can i be ready to die at any moment?   

i have arranged my civilian affairs already  the less worry i have about home the better, but how can i teach myself to suppress the selfish nature that is the will to desire my life over the task at hand? i understand that i could die driving to the grocery store to get more milk, but i want to prepare for a direct confrontation with death, not indirect    any help, references, or guidance would be greatly appreciated   "

1,how are you using stoicism during this 'pandemic'? 
1,"""we are what we eat "" do you apply such to your mindscape ? i just want to hear what people think about this  

we care about what we eat to an extend, with the saying ""we are what we eat""    but do we apply the same when it comes to media (people conversations, memes, news)  consumption and how that affects the make up of our mind soul?

when i was younger i used to enjoy all those ""i am depressed"" memes and would say ""sameeee!"" in my mind a click ""like"" on the screen  but as i grew older i started to question how this constant ""stream feed of information"" and the affirmation was affecting my mindscape   self   it's very likely if one subjects and surrounds themselves with media saying ""it's all depression's fault"" and ""you are uncapable because you're handicapped"" that even if you're not, you're likely to yield   same goes with all people who self diagnose as suffering from anxiety   adhd     ""you didn't fail  it's just anxiety "" 

i believe that one point of being stoic is being able to have a certain degree of clarity on reality and yourself   most human problems have solutions as they mostly come from the human mind, however we humans are the only sources in the universe of ""logic errors"" meaning a problem that seems to have an inadequate   impossible solution yet we grade it as ""that's the solution "" such as saying "" 1 2   4"" , which we know is ""wrong ""     without enough clarity on reality and ourselves (to learn to accept blame, and let things go) we simply can accept wrong solutions to our problems

1,"what are your go to questions to ask yourself? hi everyone, i'm new to stoicism and i'm making an effort to apply it throughout my day as well as i can  however, i sometimes notice i'm sort of searching for which principles to apply to a situation  for me, the easiest and most applicable so far is assessing how much control i really have over something  this applies to most things in some capacity 

here are some questions i've been asking myself recently 

  how much control do i really have over x situation?
  what can i do moving forward that can influence the outcome of x situation?
  which aspects of x situation are entirely out my control?
  is undue suffering stemming from aspects that are out of my control?

these questions help me locate where i'm stationed internally when i'm feeling anxious nervous antsy etc  like sometimes i think i'm being stoic, but in reality i'm actually way downstream ruminating over things out of my control  and asking these questions helps reveal that to myself   so, i was curious what others internal dialogue looks like when assessing a bothersome situation  do you have a set sequence of questions you ask yourself to get to the bottom of something?"

1,"""a man who is not afraid is not aggressive, a man who has no sense of fear of any kind is really a free, a peaceful man ""   jiddu krishnamurti just as all virtues are all connected together, and are all one in the same, it can be said that all fears are connected by the same thread and until all fear is extinguished it can return once again in a different form  it is perhaps the most fundamental emotion of any creature that wishes to survive another day to pasture, deeply rooted and imperative, fear will do anything in its power to keep itself alive in the mind of those who seek to challenge it  

which leads me to a crucial question   what is better, to overcome all fear and become fearless, or to allow fear to persist in the mind while we attempt merely to tame it? do we say that fear is unconquerable and we must pay taxes to the emperor, or do we rebel and seek to fight an enduring battle to strike it out even if we may never win? at one point, for the first choice, we must believe it to be possible to live without fear while maintaining our human dignity  that the sage is not unattainable, but only rare to achieve, and accessible to us  for the second, we have to convince ourselves that living with a dangerous creature is more viable, and that we can somehow avoid its venomous bite 

  

as an aside, here's krishnamurti's wikipedia entry if you wish to know more about his remarkable life as a philosopher of the 20th century    i find his ideas to be in line with a stoic mindset, without mysticism, and purely driven by a sincere commitment to truth "

1,"why isn't temporary abstinence a common practise in stoicism? i know that stoicism is all for moderation  but moderation is different for everyone and can be hard to figure out  sure, drinking two cups of coffee a day might sound like moderation, but if you get a headache after not drinking it for four days, then you know that it isn't moderation 

stoicism is largely about becoming the master of yourself so why isn't abstinence a common practise for self control and self discovery? we shouldn't rely on externals  we all know that, but we are often blind to our own flaws and addictions so abstinence would bring that needed clarity  

we often realize the value of things when lost  that goes to pleasures also, but as in our need instead of value  if you want to become the master of yourself, to not be reliant on the externals to make you feel better, it would make sense for you to figure out what externals you rely on right now, right? 

so why isn't it common to do like a two week abstinence period every year or something?"

1,"stoicism for a better life   weekly exercise (october 14) hello there,

for this exercise, let us look once again outside our school of thought for some wise words  this is an excerpt from the book  man's search for meaning  written by viktor frankl 

 gt ""everything can be taken from a man but one thing  the last of the human freedoms to choose one s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one s own way "" 

the words may be from outside our school, but the idea is one of the pillars of stoicism  making a distinction between what is dependent on us vs  what is not dependent on us  acknowledging this line that separates these two realms is a core precept of the philosophy  consequently, focusing our time and energy on the realm of that which is dependent on us is a core practice of the philosophy 

you have heard time and time again that stoicism is a practical philosophy  in other words, it is a philosophy that is practiced through its application   not through memorizing its ideas and quotes  and practicing it means simply this  apply your rational mind in the present moment    apply your consciousness in the ""here and now""   be present and mindful in your eternal sequence of present moments 

the stoics define a free individual as one who owns their will  the only place you are entirely free is in your judgments, decisions and in your ability to manage how you are going to respond to any given situation   no matter what is happening around you  you are the only one who can enslave yourself to externals  

no one can make you think that which you don't want to  they may be able to force your body to respond to external stimuli, but your mind is always free    so as a practical exercise this week, when you feel trapped, forced or upset with externals, remind yourself this simple truth  no matter what is happening outside your mind, you (your thoughts, judgments and decisions) are always yours and therefore always free

1," don t find friendships to substitute your previous ones  for this is needy  seek a friendship only for the sake of the friendship itself  and what will happen when you no longer grieve the loss of the former relation? one who has recovered no longer turns to medicine   yes, i know, this is not always the case  even when someone seeks friendship just because they feel lonely or feel as though that they re one friendship short and they must see themselves back to 5 friends, for example, they may keep the friendship even once they have recovered  yet, oftentimes the opposite course happens  

i think it s not very wise to desire or seek friendships for any other reason than for the friendship itself  if you feel lonely, that is your perspective  if you find a friendship, it itself won t end your perspective in the long run  that is up to you  so you re seeking a friendship for the sheer fact that you feel lonely   when this is no cure  perhaps in the short term you ll feel better but not in the long run usually  that is just my view

someone is free if all that happens to him comes about in accordance with his choice and no one else is able to impede him   therefore, true education consists precisely in this  in learning to wish that everything should come just as it does  as the one who ordained them has ordained  both virtue and vice, summer and winter  he has granted us a body and its parts, companions to share and experiences to be felt  it is this order of things in mind that we should approach our education not as to change the existing order, but, things around us being as they are and as their nature dictates so that we for our part may keep our will in harmony with whatever comes to pass   where can you be hindered of contentment? in fact, if you are living you are able to accept everything with said contentment  exile? no, just as socrates for the part was not in prison because he was there willingly, making it a gift and good fortune  

with regard to the body   when it comes to your reason, you're not inferior to the gods nor do you fall short of them, because the greatness of soul is not measured by height or length, but by the quality of its judgments  character and virtue  you have nobility and greatness of mind to enable you to deal with every circumstance  shouldn t you be giving thanks to god the gods the universe nature for having enabled you to rise above everything that they have placed within your power and having you rendered accountable only for what is subject to your control? what is then in your control? only the right use of your impressions

1,"buying a new car turned my aim for perfection in an obsession, how would a stoic tackle this? what happened is as follows 

my car was about to have some maintenance done, but after thinking about what was wise my dad (ex mechanic) and me concluded that it would be wiser to buy something else  

 amp  x200b 

so first we looked around for a car of the same make as my current car  we looked at a number of cars, but all of them ended up not being good deals  there was a differente type of car on my list as well, but it took some persuasion to get my dad to take a look at those as well  

  
we went to a local garage, met the man running it there and looked at the car  it all looked very good, and the shop gave a nice feeling  so we concluded  why look around any further, lets go for this one  so we did, payed a nice and honest price for it and all was well  

 amp  x200b 

however, i since cannot stop looking for other versions of the same car  just to check whether we actually had a good deal  i'm trying to figure out what trim level mine has, what it's supposed to have (the car was imported a few years ago, so trim might vary), and what differs  this turns into almost obsessive research 

 amp  x200b 

i sometimes feel just happy with the choice i made, but it cannot stop aiming for perfection and doubting about the car we bought  in the end it probably was the best, cause it was close and the car looks good and has all the trim i need  yet a few things make it differ to others on the market, and i cannot seem to stop trying to find reasons why the car is the way it is instead of just being happy with what it is

1,"a blessing in disguise   seneca i have just stumbled accross a quote that summarizes the mentality that i ended up having in the most important but also the most anxious period of my life about 4 years ago 

 amp  x200b 

 gt ""to reduce your worry, you must assume that what you fear may happen is certainly going to happen ""   seneca

i was in a special program for two years, preparing for a national competition to enter the most selective universitiy programs in europe  it was very much a hit or miss  if you fail, you lose 2 years and go to university back at level 0  if you win, you're really well off  i took the bet  

but from day one my teachers told me i was worth nothing  i was bad at maths, philosophy, anything that was in the contest i was basically bad at  my teachers told me that i could only expect the lowest ranked school with my level  those were the schools that basically nobody wanted because their added value isn't amazing compared to the 10  hour workdays you pull for 2 years where you barely have any time to yourself and barely have weekends 

i still remember how i felt very clearly  i felt lost and one month before the exam i gave up  i had hopes of going to the best ranked schools, i even had their logos hung up on my door so that everytime i went to school, i was reminded of what the goal was  but suddenly, i lost all hope because essentially my teachers were right  i was so bad they would let me write math exams at home  it took me 1 to 2 straight days to barely complete an exam that usually took 4 hours  these exams were meant to be unfinishable within 4 hours for competition's sake but still 1 to two days was too much and i just acknowledged that 

at that point, i just decided that the worst would happen and made plans accordingly  i looked up where these low ranked schools were and projected myself living in those cities  i just accepted what i was afraid of 

a little later, the contests started  it was horrible  i took all the contests because i still applied to the major schools  so i was writing exams for about 6 hours a day on average for a month  the only difference was that i gave up seeing it as a competition  i stopped caring and accepted that i was not good enough anyways to go to the best ones  all i did from that moment on was write what i knew in the exams, do my best and forget the rest  one of the exams we got was a past exam destined for people at the phd level, it's really that insane  i just wrote what i knew and went back to my hotel and stopped caring  i even dated one of the girls i was competing against actually 

what happened? it's the most unexpected things i ever experienced  one day, after about two months of waiting, the results finally came in  as soon as i saw the results, i rushed into my room, closed the door and cried  i was accepted in the top 5 and i was literally the best student of my whole school  even the students who always had 100  at most exams didn't score as highly as i did  i was in shock 

the lesson i learnt from this is to accept the worst as if it was real and to just live with it  it took all my anxiety, my fears, everything away  it was a huge national competition, everybody was sweating, afraid, getting little sleep and here i was hopeless  i'm still quite amazed by it and i'm glad i stumbled accross seneca's quote today because i sort of started forgetting about how important it is  just remembering this took away my anxiety that i developed over the last week for no reason

1," no school has more goodness and gentleness  none has more love for human beings, nor more attention to the common good         the goal which it assigns to us is to be useful, to help others, and to take care, not only of ourselves, but of everyone in general and of each one in particular   seneca, on clemency 3 3 

this quotation resonates with me, especially as a teacher  in the past, i ve risked my stoic practice becoming too self centered, a constant turning inward  and while self examination is at the core of what i practice, this quotation reminds me that self examination is done so i might be useful to others, deal kindly with my fellow humans, and work toward a society that s more wise and just

1,"the power of solitude when i spent six months in solitary confinement, one of the men i look up to the most sent me a letter saying ""some people will pay a lot of money just for some alone time at a retreat to work on themselves  you've been given this for free  use it well ""  and i did  i studied my books(the only stoic text i had was stockdale's  philosophical thoughts of a fighter pilot  but i had some other good ones ), i worked out, and i meditated  since my release i've sometimes found myself missing the isolation and alone time while getting caught up in all the random bullshit that comprises my day  after thinking about this for a while, another man i look up to a lot told me this  

 ""men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the country, sea shores, and mountains  and thou too art wont to desire such things very much  but this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men, f    or it is in thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself  for nowhere either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble does a man retire than into his own soul,     particularly when he has within him such thoughts that by looking into them he is immediately in perfect tranquility  and i affirm that tranquility is nothing else than the good ordering of the mind  constantly then give to thyself this retreat, and renew thyself  and let thy principles be brief and fundamental, which, as soon as thou shalt recur to them, will be sufficient to cleanse the soul completely, and to send thee back free from all discontent with the things to which thou returnest ""     marcus aurelius, meditations 4 3

we talk a lot about the stoic value of self reliance and being okay with being alone  these are important, because when you desire the company of others too much, you open yourself up to disappointment and may not function as well when you do not have it  humans  are  social animals though and i'm not trying to downplay the importance of community at all, but i would argue that in order to be an effective member of any community, you need to be an effective individual  

i would challenge you all to start taking some dedicated alone time daily, or at least weekly, and turn your attention inwards  this can be done during your normal wind down time at night, but it can be done on your commute, in the shower, or while walking a pet  put your devices away, get away from other people, get outside if you can, and spend some time getting to know yourself a little better  journaling helps too

1,"stoicism vs black lives matter it's incontrovertibly true that black lives matter, but a decentralized political organization calling itself ""black lives matter"" has hijacked that phrase and i can't see how it's virtuous 

stoics repeatedly counsel people to turn away from the passions and emotions which dictate their actions, but black lives matter encourages the opposite, inculcating a deep anger and resentment towards police and government  the stoics said that such approaches were ""against nature "" what they meant was that the emotions would cloud one's judgement, obscure the truth, and likely result in self defeating actions 

yes it's insanely controversial right now, but stoics should stand up for what's right no matter the cost  working class black neighborhoods have a high crime rate  defunding police and alienating police from the neighborhoods they are supposed to protect is not going to help working class blacks  it's going to increase crime and keep those neighborhoods in poverty for years to come  that's an obvious outcome which reinforces the stoic reliance on reason over emotion 

using reason and ignoring emotion, we might be able to see that the most successful emancipation and ciivil rights movements of the previous century were led by gandhi and mlk  if there is really something at stake here, nonviolence and reconciliation will obviously be far more effective at generating a desired outcome than looting and alienation  if we really want police brutality against blacks to end, let's have block parties where the police are invited, where they get to hang out with their fellow citizens they are assigned to protect 

accomplished stoics shouldn't get riled up in the midst of any of this  they should be a calm voice of reason and guide the different parties towards reconciliation  to the extent that one party or the other can't accept reconciliation, they're too emotional to create a beneficial outcome, and can be safely ignored "

now this post is not about anime or anything  but when i listened to the music, i suddenly reminded me of life  the music did not feel vigorous or energetic, it felt calm, accepting, melancholic  the music obviously had a sad tone  but it did not felt sad, it did not feel dark or anything, but if felt like the silent and solitude acceptance of one's fate 

and this music made me imagine of life as a whole  it is filled with suffering, with pain, and with misfortune  but this is life, and this is our fate to go through this  this music was like a painting that reminded me of what to come to my life  today, my mother felt sick and i took care of her  i'm then reminded of the impermanence of things and epictetus' teachings appeared in my mind  but nevertheless, i knew that if my mother were to vanish, i will feel terribly awful  the mere thought of that hurted me 

it's like what socrates said 

 gt ""  if all misfortunes were laid   in one common heap whence   everyone   must take an   equal   portion, most people would be contented to take their own and depart ""

and it was at this moment, listening to this melody, that i learned the beauty of music, not just a form of entertainment, but a means to communicate ideas that cannot be expressed through words  

everyone has their own predisposition so i'm sure if you might not hear what i hear, but you can still try listening to the music "

1,"a stoic answer to toxic masculinity  
i was having a discussion with a friend about my stoic practice when my friend mentioned how stoicism might feed into toxic masculinity, specifically the way my friend believed stoicism and t m  both advise people to overcome or suppress their emotions  

thankfully, it was clear this was an opportunity for me to remind myself that no one does or thinks wrong intentionally, and that every tension tension can be an opportunity to teach, learn, and grow  

we continued talking, and i drew the distinction between being stoic and being stoic  

then, i described the stoic practice of identifying and examining the first movements of the soul, in order to better understand the roots of our passions, and to relate rationally and healthily to our emotions  

it was then it hit me that stoicism has been providing an answer for thousands of years to the type of lower case stoicism prevalent in our culture  

practicing stoics are intimately acquainted with their emotions  they can read their emotions the way seasoned mariners understand the creating waves and the ebb and flow of the tides  

so rather than feed into unhealthy emotional suppression found all too often in our young men (i see this among my high school students), a stoic approach finds a way out by means of a way through  

 the obstacle is the way , as marcus would put it

1,"looking for guidance and explanations regarding identifying unique spiritual basic necessities  this is something i have come across in the book ""your users manual""  so i'm just reading ""your users manual"" by anderson silver and i was wondering if i could have some insight and guidance on the part where he lays out some guidelines to help you with understanding and deciding what your unique spiritual basic necessities should be (he previously explains that our physical necessities and purpose from this universe are one of the same, to simply hydrogenate carbon dioxide for the planet) 

i'm having trouble with number 5 here  how can i decide i necessity which isn't influenced by career, materials or loved ones? i was going to try to pick productivity and researching more on a subject to help me better my career but he states that shouldn't be the case  i guess i need a little help on knowing how to find a necessity which is within me, and ""completing"" it daily  could anyone help explain it more to me? thank you  

the guidelines are as follows  
1  necessities must be decided objectively by you, and not imposed on you by anyone else, whether it'd parents, tv, buddha or seneca 

2  make sure your necessities are realistic and achievable within that current time (he uses the example of wanting to help starving children in africa but not being able to due to logistics and finance  

3  every day is death, live day by day  your necessities can not be something to be completed in the future, it must be something to be completed daily  

4  your necessities are yours, cannot be linked to the universes will or fate  cannot be linked to anything external including loved ones, careers or materials  must be 100  subject to your choices and actions  

5  necessities must be deeply rooted within you  when revalidating them over time they should not be constantly changing  

6  make a list of all your old necessities to identify falsehoods you used to believe in and better identify truer necessities now "

1,"the courage to be disliked   ichiro kishimi, fumitake koga   one every aspiring stoic should read  after reading this book i couldn't help myself from posting this on this sub  this book is based on the works of adler who was contemporary of jung and  freud    the story goes as discussion between a philosopher and youth  this books touches the stoic idea's so well and simple it makes it easy to understand  youth's questions are spot on , and answers are so insightful   when i started out stoicism i had so many doubts and questions, they all answered in this book    

some idea's on the books are given below   

1   a healthy feeling of inferiority is not something that comes from comparing oneself to others  it comes from one s comparison with one s ideal self  
2   the courage to be happy also includes the courage to be disliked  when you have gained that courage, your interpersonal relationships will all at once change into things of lightness   
3   it s that you are disliked by someone  it is proof that you are exercising your freedom and living in freedom, and a sign that you are living in accordance with your own principles   
4   no matter what has occurred in your life up to this point, it should have no bearing at all on how you live from now on   that you, living in the here and now, are the one who determines your own life   
5   who ultimately is going to receive the result brought about by the choice that is made? when the child has made the choice of not studying, ultimately, the result of that decision not being able to keep up in class or to get into the preferred school, for instance does not have to be received by the parents  clearly, it is the child who has to receive it  in other words, studying is the child s task

1,"a chronic disease that makes me forget, and destroys my ruling faculty with every day passing zdarova gentlemen,  
wanted to share something with you dudes of stoicism, as we are brothers of a deeper understanding of life, and pretty much the living of real actual peace of mind   
you might understand 

  
life hasn't been easy, but it has been the life that was granted, climbed and improved, and stoicism has always been a massive pillar since i discovered it and realized how golden truth is, since back over 2 years ago  so no matter what honestly, life was pretty peachy regardless of what went on,  
power of our ruling faculty is insane  truly the only thing within our power 100    
life's golden with stoicism in it, combined with the modern life and modern issues, you basically live the god mode given by god itself  i still am amazed by that   
i'm 20 years old, young and fresh, climbing and rising into life  or was at least, until the thing occured 

a certain situation happened, a massive pizdets   
i've been having a massive decline in health from the past year and a half, and a massive critical one going straight down from a little bit over half a year ago,  
a combination of chronic autoimmune diseases that were neglected and undiagnosed for too long and had their fair damage and more of unknown too, currently fresh in the long waiting process of getting even an answer with how processes go   
treatment is unlikely for the time being, especially with epidemic stealing all the resources from the already broken down medical care  and as far as my knowledge in base medicine, brain is very tough to treat, unless it decides to support itself once the disease is off, but that isn't the case alas   
the local medicare is absolute garbage, neglected and pathetic, so that was expected, as i come from a modernized shithole  in the most truthful wording 

basically, a collection of piled up diseases ended up damaging me in such a way that life hasn't been the life i knew ever since,  
physically destroyed, walk like a zombie due to the pain and weakness fatigue, lost entire body shape, hair mildly sheds, barely eat, barely sleep, senses broken with smell and taste fading away at times, vision too sometimes   
but that was the least of my worries  with my realization of life today, that's all just external bullshit 

the biggest issue was

the cognitive decline, that brought down my ability to communicate, simply destroyed my speech analyze and talk speed, the ability to think in a normal tempo and performing the usual thinking existing tasks, that was just the start that went on rather slowly but launched itself fast   
started lightly, and didn't mean much back in the day, it was just here and there that i was having difficulties to suddenly normally talk without just stopping and staring at nothing, and other bullshit that ended up leading to the current state   


  
leading on,  
i had to quit university courses, quit the job, due to severe memory problems that simply had too many gaps for me to even complete an assignment, or study a course,  
communication with people went declining rapidly, as i noticed that suddenly i wasn't able to speak or even let my mind flow around people, and talking and thinking along the action  so all contacts were cut too, i was not capable of it efficiently   
the physical and cognitive symptoms dropped that bad that i became dependent on my family for assistance, as i struggle to move much myself, the pain and the weakness is mad   
barely eat, barely sleep due to weird uncontrollable nightmares that are hard to explain to what they may be related   
a major part of all that i knew, and was, was erased slowly and unsteadily,  
from memories, abilities and just living   
used to be a man on a purpose, that i understood recently, was god given to me   
practiced complementary medicine after i was lucky to be educated with such rare knowledge, and treated many close to me and was about to open a business of my own, the purpose included all i loved and was proficient in life  all god gave me   
lived in a shithole, but loved people and loved life for what there still was in it, beauty   
i was gifted with charisma, amazing improvisation skills, natural leadership, quick thinking and simply a flow of a man, of life and nature, and when i combined it with stoicism and god of nature, i was released into true me   
a rare thing to achieve at such age, i couldn't be more thankful for such blessing 

 amp  x200b 

i'll cut the govno in the middle, straight to current truth and reality 

in the current state, i suffer from real bad cognitive problems, that destroy my ability to think rationally, makes my information processing very slow and lacking rationale due to the inability to think more than just plain simply likea  child (which is the best comparison for it), i cannot read without getting a migrane from the inability to process what i even read like it just doesnt work, and a severe memory loss that makes me forget 90  of what happened yesterday, let's not talk about what even happened before yesterday   
memory loss on the degree of the new information input loss mostly, but still has the erasing abilities of the past as well, some of the old memories and knowledge remained, along with practical but accessing it is horribly painful and hard (physically) for some reason   
i do my best with try to re enter into meditations and the discourses which led my life, and were erased and are erased with every day from my mind, (i have notes taped all over my room to assist that, but it fails too  i just don't recognize the written, or its context )

with each passing day, i lose myself slowly and unsteadily, there are days that i forget where i am upon awakening, and generally i don't remember much how i even look without looking in the mirror    
i don't recognize the books on my shelf, nor places, nor memories, nothing   
every experience related to external things like, reading a book, visiting a place, smelling something, just looking outside the window for the same familiar look,  
every single time it feels like a first experience, or second experience at least  sometimes it differs, some things i used to do, see and live daily are every time new first time experience feeling like 

brain just can't access this information for some reason, so damn empty inside i feel the vaccuum   
while back in the day, i've had the entire stoic 101 in my mind, practiced, lived, breathed   
it also went away in the process of the mind wipe   


so i was shocked recently, when i opened my journals and notes that i had over the progress of climbing and improving of myself, i usually couldn't read them because my brain just didn't get the context, but recently i managed to sit on them a bit, and realized     
i have lost all what i was made into, and lost it in a way i am really unable to recover due to just how it is medically  brain is unable   
i discovered that the way i handled life back then, was actually how and for what i was made, a man on his purpose, a legend, so i see and recall with tough effort,  
i have lost my ability for rationale, and i didn't even notice it, i became easier to manipulate by the scarcity mindset feminine surrounding i am sadly stuck in, for the years being which was the part of the endgame process to change   
along with other info from the journals as of life perspectives, books, business and stuff that now when my eyes pass on it, i really don't understand who even wrote this shit  is it even mine?  


i am simply, a wiped, and slowly forgetting myself, man   
the destroyed and thrown external life i built, doesn't matter, that's just theories and external shit,  
but my mind is losing itself,  
i knew that by over half a year already, but now it's a real official realization   
with each day passing, my reality perception is being erased, not to talk about rationale,  
i lose the ability to differ between good or bad or just what it is because i am consumed into everything outside 

currently, i am living on the pure empty mind of just vital things (barely), and emotional impulsiveness due to the absolute lack of any base rationale in my mind that sticks, and doesn't vanish to sudden burst of cognitive delusions that arise due to the condition   


can't call it scary, because i can't even feel or analyze emotions normally,  
just like a person i recall, that has dementia, they can't acknowledge their decline, they just sit and rot  i can't recognize it is abnormal anymore, due to how long of a time has passed (which i don't even know how long it has been, every week feels in my mind like last year, i remember none of it )  
without my old notes that i wrote, i wouldn't even know and acknowledge all that   
especially that i am all alone in this, fading  family struggles to acknowledge this due to their own issues, femininity tends to care more about itself   
 but regarding that i don't care much, since comfort   validation or whatever other approvals people may express, wouldn't change reality and the facts of what's happening   


imagine losing the only thing you truly had control over, 100  control over it   
your ability, and will, for making judgements, decisions and rational thinking and simply understanding of impressions in life   
that was the one and true thing i have had, which has already got wiped partially, and is headed downwards as the time goes 

 amp  x200b 

  
i saved a page, i don't recall why even, but i read it again recently  as epictetus mentioned the topic of the open door, and how a man has the power to decide, even in that subject that when he no longer sees the game of life beneficial to him (whether rationally, or not), he has the power in himself to decide and not participate in it   
but simply and technically said,  
until god doesn't give you the signal that it's time, and you have finished your time on your post (purpose) that you were assigned for in this life, treat yourself well and live life with good endurance 

the story of the athlete that lost his genitals, the man that his life was his atheletic image even if external, it was part of his purpose, his post in life, being a man of olympics,  
so him losing his genitals, part of what he was, was a fair reason for him at least, to leave his life 

i digested my current reality, that i keep forgetting every single day, i made a long struggled written thinking   


after losing the base of what i was made for, my god given purpose that was based on what was within me, my character  a cripple   
the loss of my inner existence, that led to the loss of what was basically me and my life, just like the athlete's balls that he lost, i lost my character, my ability to communicate, my charisma, my mind    
all wiped, slowly     


honestly, even that   i gave up after a while of painful struggle against it, unable to believe that the only thing i had control over was slowly decaying   
but i gave it up, it was lost, i didn't need it no more because it wasn't here   
i thought, the only thing i truly needed, was my rational thinking, my ruling faculty   
i believed it will truly be that one last thing that will remain and stick, and i would tend that garden   


i was wrong gentlemen   
my ruling faculty, and rationale are long ago already out of normal perspectives of existence   
they still function, but not in a state where a person can be preceived logical 

a signal that it's time, that it's my role that was given by god, finished?  
who knows man   


would be cool to exchange a few words about such circumstance with epictitues tbh, although i probably know his answer already

1,"i graduated today and i feel alright about it i'm the kind of person that doesn't take growing up or leaving people behind easily but today, instead of seeing it as a moment to be sad or ecstatic i decided to accept things as it is   that even these beautifully sad moments are a part of my fate and i should embrace them  i should let go when the time is right  so yes, i do allow myself to be swept up by this wave of life and fate, and i released my fears and inhibitions today  i think fondly of victor frankl's quote  when we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves   we cannot stop life from making us face the cruel world or taking away safety from us but we can always choose to see everything instead as a learning point to move forward  so i'm very content and excited for what lies ahead of me, and i will kick off the dust off my feet  and i'm glad stoicism has taught me this emotional intelligence   )"

1," request  i need some courage for what i am planning to do! my ex (my first ever relationship) had broken up with me almost four and a half years back  due to completely cut off communication between us, i moved on with my life, but never really fell in love again 

fast forward to now  we came into contact last year, talk everyday, have met up couple of times  i realise how much that she's the only person still whom i want to be with  she had asked me then if i wanted to get back together, but i had turned her down because i wasn't sure of my feelings then   


unfortunately, she's in a relationship now which makes things immensely difficult

i am planning to meet her tomorrow and tell her everything about how i feel  i have never done such a thing before and some wisdom and advice is gravely sought!"
1,"how do you not let the thoughts and opinions of others effect you in a negative way? how do you not let the thoughts and opinions of others effect you in a negative way?

i struggle with an almost constant feeling of frustration about these things, mostly as a result of what's going on in our country right now  i'm sure others can understand  

any suggested reading on this topic? thank you "
1,"on politics and opinion (discourses 1 5) these days it can be very hard to avoid the discussion of politics, and it can be frustrating when friends or loved ones don't see things the same way as us  it can be commendable to participate in politics in a virtuous manner, but when doing so as a stoic you must take care to not make assumptions about your opponent(s), specifically the assumption that ""if i converse with them long enough, eventually they will see things my way ""  that is a terrible trap to fall into, and can quickly become a endless loop of heated anger and frustration  consider the first part of discourses 1 5  

 ""it is said that there are those who will oppose very evident truths, and yet it is not easy to find a reason which may persuade such a person to alter his opinion  this may arise neither from his own strength, nor from the weakness of his teacher  but when a man becomes obstinate in error, reason cannot always reach him "" 

""evident truths"" applies to both subjective truths(politics, science, health, you name it) and objective truths(although it's another debate entirely whether there are any objective truths)  

if you choose to get into a political discussion with someone on the other side, my advice would be to speak your piece, listen to theirs, and change the topic  because even if you ""verbally joust"" flawlessly, even if you perfectly point out all their fallacies while defending you're own, even if  they actually start to see your point , chances are they'll just double down on what they know and what's comfortable to them, and you'll end up wasting your breath 

go out and vote though  cheers "

1,"we are made for one another hi! i am relatively new to the stoic philosophy, but i wanted to share a new word that i learned today by marcus aurelius  the word is sympatheia and it focuses on the fact we people are made to serve each other  

we cannot control everything that happens around us, but we can control how we interact with the divisive and turbulent time, and for aurelius this was to focus on sympatheia, we are all part of the same, an interconnected cosmo  we all exist, think and breath as human beings and are at this point the same  in sympatheia i got reinforced in the mindset of being present and focused on humans when so many things seems out of control  what we can control is how we interact with one another and be willing to be present for somebody else 

hope this helped somebody else as well "

1,"could this be a proof that god exists??? the topic about the existence of a god is indeed very debatable, but lately i've been thinking about it and i came up with something i believe to be a 'logical proof' of god's existence 

i never used to believe in magic, soccery or things of that sort, but then not believing in these things but believing in a supreme god pretty makes for an imbalance in the scale of things 

in 2015, i was undertaking a training at a place not so far from my home  on my way to work on a particular day, i noticed a huge gathering  on getting close to find out the cause, i saw a man in the middle of the crowd performing what i called 'tricks'  he did several things including smoking a cigarette and making the smoke come out of a teddy bear's ear  it wasn't difficult finding a way to rationalize all he was doing but then he did this very one thing i could not comprehend how  there was an empty carton he placed on the ground, i was certain that the carton was empty, he then called on one of us who was watching to place a red piece of fabric over the empty carton, after this, he asked the man to name anything that he wants  the man mentioned that he didn't have a phone and so he needed one  this performer then instructed the man to stretch out his hands in the air to ""catch"" mobile phones 
the instruction was this "" let 5 samsung phones, 5 nokia phones, and 5 lg phones come out of the shop of that fat woman who doesn't give her brother or sister anything"" so, this man caught five (5) samsung phones, 5 lg phones and 5 nokia phones  ( apparently when he was catching, it all seemed he was catching air but the man who was performing instructed him to release the empty hand on the red piece of fabric which was over the carton)  to cut the long story short, when the fabric was later removed, the carton contained exactly 15 phones (5 lg phones, 5 nokia phones and 5 samsung phones) 

what could this be? i pondered and up till date i still cannot explain it  but that's not the point 

just recently, the thought came to mind again and i decided to contemplate on it  i'm from nigeria, and in this part of the world, majority of people are very religious, they worship all sorts of things and it is very common to hear things such as "" this and this is happening to you because there is someone in your vilage who has done so and so"" meaning that events are being manipulated by someone against another's favor  it has even become a popular saying that people generally joke with when one experiences an unfortunate event, people say ""your vilage people have come for you""

this is still not my point    but then my point is, "" if external events can be manipulated to work against someone, can't they also be manipulated in favor of one? and if both cases are possible, what forces are in charge?

a few months ago, i took some time contemplating god's existence and i came to see god as 'the impartial judge between man and nature'  so i concluded that under god's supreme rule, man cannot cheat nature and neither can nature cheat man and everything that happens naturally is fair game  but what about those things that happen out of the ordinary?

there's a bible story about a man named job  this man was described as a just and faithful man  a good man  according to the story, certain events were manipulated by the 'devil' against this man  as a result, he lost his possessions, his kids and became seriously plagued  the lesson at the end was that after loosing those things, he didn't loose his good will  he remained faithful until the end and he was rewarded 

of course, the story of job is a proof of what the stoics teach that external events cannot affect our will and that good and bad is only found in our choices  but then, does it still remain fair game when these events are manipulated in an unatural way? and if what physics teaches is true that ""to every action there's an equal but opposite reaction"" then this force behind manipulating events unjustly ought to have an opposite that is capable of balancing the scales 

supposing the force behind this unjust manipulation of events is 'the devil' isn't this a proof that the just force is god? isn't it consistent with reason that people have such a god to turn to when external things are manipulated unjustly?

i'd like to hear your thoughts on this "

1,"stoicism on ending friendships hello! ive been lurking for some time and i don t think i ve seen one before on actively (but amicably) ending friendships 

in my situation there s someone at work i felt closest to for a while but over time tensions arose and he s drifting away from me and gravitating towards other people at work  it bothers me a lot and i don t know if it s my fault that things are the way it is 

perhaps the friendship had an expiration date and that s just nature taking its course? friends come and go, i guess? that s what i m trying to convince myself to think of but any enlightenment from this community would help too  thank you "

1,"a stoic approach to a toxic father? 21yo m living at home with parents until finished college 

how would you approach having a toxic father? to elaborate why i would categorize him as toxic 

  never present in my life as a youth 

  alcoholic in denial

  manipulative and childish

  irresponsible (i often had to clean up his messes as a child)

  physically and emotionally abusive when i was a child  when confronted about this claims i'm overreacting and he was a bit rough but abuse abusive  i differ in opinion 

  refuses to change in any way, paints people as trying to control him if they ask  he refuses to allow anyone be the boss of him  smh

  despite all this paints himself as the victim because i don't love him, i've made it clear i want to but i need him to work on himself 

to sum up, i have a severe hatred of this man  i feel robbed of a father and all the traits which i would have attained with proper parenting  for example i had a subconscious attraction to very toxic relationships most of my life, to this day i get teary eyed when i see a father play with his son  i dont understand what i did to this man to deserve this and worry the damage done will last until the day i die  what life could i have lived if this didnt happen?

1,"i don't belive in good and evil  should i?  

 gt  when you wake up in the morning, tell yourself  the people i deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly  they are like this because they can't tell good from evil  but i have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own   not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine  and so none of them can hurt me  no one can implicate me in ugliness  nor can i feel angry at my relative, or hate him  we were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower  to obstruct each other is unnatural  to feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him  these are unnatural  

 amp  x200b 

this is the marcus aurelius quote that hits my in the feels lately  to me, it is the long, and more fleashed out version of ""be kind to everyone you meet"", kinda  but i just realised, part of his reasoning is because they can't tell good from evil, and he has seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil   so here is the problem, although i realise that the wrongdoes has a nature related to my own, we are similar, i don't acknowledge evil and good as forces of nature (or people if you view them as seperate)  i don't belive the neo natzi is evil  i belive they have a very different set of belifs from what i have  i don't belive a catastophe is evil  i belive it has a lot of bad consequenses, but in its self a flood bomb fire etc  can not be evil  ""it is stupidity, not evil"" is one of my favorite sayings  at the same time i don't belive in good  i belive it is a part of the language as a word with a descriptive meaning, but not as a concept of itself  it is all in the eye of the beholder  for example, i give money to charity every month, even though i am a student  i don't belive this is good  it's more of a necessity for comfortable life of my conscience  i can contribute with something, therefore i do  same reason as to why i am a vegetarian  i don't belive mother theresa was good, i belive she did what she found to be right, just like the neo natzi  

i think the meaning of the verse still stands, but the reasoning puzzels me  i do belive that you can hold two non compatible opinoions at the same time  like, i don't belive in fate, but i love ""amor fati""  i don't think the world as deterministic as the original stoics ones did, but i do belive in cause, effect and consequenses  could this be somewhat the same with evil and good? what are your thoughts on this? do you belive in good and evil? why why not?"

    now i know that s not the whole movie nor is it all there is to andy but he took what others would have moaned and groaned about and made the best of it and left shawshank in better condition (save the wardens office) then when he came in  we could all learn from andy "

1,"the rider and the horse i started the laws of human nature today and i came across an analogy about rationality that i thought you guys might appreciate as much as i did (apologize for formatting, on mobile) 

     the horse is our emotional nature continually impelling us to move  this horse has tremendous energy and power, but without a rider it cannot be guided  it is wild, subject to predators, and continually heading into trouble  the rider is our thinking self  through training and practice, it holds the reins and guides the horse, transforming this powerful animal energy into something productive 

    the one without the other is useless  without the rider, no directed movement or purpose  without the horse, no energy, no power  in most people the horse dominates, and the rider is weak  in some people the rider is too strong, holds the reins too tightly, and is afraid to occasionally let the animal go into a gallop  the horse and rider must work together 

    this means we consider our actions beforehand  we bring as much thinking as possible to a situation before we make a decision  but once we decide what to do, we loosen the reins and enter action with boldness and a spirit of adventure  instead of being slaves to this energy, we channel it  this is the essence of rationality

1,"in light of the prejudice seen in the world at the moment, i found this quote very topical      if what philosophers say of the kinship between god and men be true, what has any one to do, but, like socrates, when he is asked what countryman he is, never to say that he is a citizen of athens, or of corinth, but of the universe? for why, if you limit yourself to athens, do you not farther limit yourself to that mere corner of athens where your body was brought forth? is it not, evidently, from some larger local tie, which comprehends not only that corner, and your whole house, but the whole country of your fathers, that you call yourself an athenian, or a corinthian? he then, who understands the administration of the universe, and has learned that the principal and greatest and most comprehensive of all things is this vast system, extending from men to god  and that from him the seeds of being are descended, not only to one s father or grandfather, but to all things that are produced and born on earth  and especially to rational natures, as they alone are qualified to partake of a communication with the deity, being connected with him by reason  why may not such a one call himself a citizen of the universe? why not a son of god? and why shall he fear anything that happens among men? shall kinship to c sar, or any other of the great at rome, enable a man to live secure, above contempt, and void of all fear whatever  and shall not the having god for our maker, and father, and guardian, free us from griefs and alarms?

 gt ""show me someone who isn't a slave! one is a slave to lust, another to greed, another to power, and all are slaves to fear   no servitude is more abject than the self imposed "" 

amor fati   most of us have heard this core stoic precept already, right? well you may be surprised to know that the term was actually coined by nietzsche  nietzsche was known for a lot of things including wrongly being associated with the nazis (it was his sister who repackaged some of his work after his death), having the best moustache of any philosopher ever (yes i stand by this claim) and going completely bonkers at the end of his life  how bonkers? oh boy   he lost his mind completely   and i mean completely, to the point where he was feasting on his own feces (a disease known as coprophagia    it is a behaviour that can manifest itself in the terminal stages of a schizophrenic patient) 

but before his mental illness took over, nietzsche wrote some of the most intricate and insightful works on the human condition  he was not a stoic, but anyone who's read his work can pick up on the stoic undertones  moreover, he talks about the stoics and their indifference to all that happens and summarized this approach with the words  amor fati  which is now part of the stoic lexicon 

our stoic guides urge us to take this a step further  instead of simply accepting what happens, they urge us to actually  enjoy  what has happens (no matter how ""bad"") because it is part of the same universal reason that made you and gave you your consciousness    amor fati  it's not just accepting fate, it is loving everything that happens    so as a practical exercise this week, try and find a way to love all that happens to you, no matter how unpleasant it may be    because remember, the same universal reason, the same sequence of cosmic events that made that thing happen, also gave you life and awareness and consciousness to observe and experience it 

let me know your insights on this exercise  it's not an easy one, but can be a very rewarding one

1,"using stoicism to help cope with an injury hi all, i injured my back around a year ago and have been going through various types of rehab ever since, i wanted to get your opinions of how you can apply stoicism to help manage the mental challenges of dealing and coming to terms with an injury?

bit of a context on mine and how i've shaped my mindset  the cause of the injury is still unknown to me but all signs point to an incorrect deadlift  i went to a pretty dark place early on when i realized this wasn't something i couldn't shake off in a week or so and be back to full fitness any time soon  i was initially frustrated, annoyed and feeling sorry for myself  around and around i went 

i had started studying stoicism before the injury by a few months and felt if i could ever shift my mindset into acceptance and tranquility with what i was going through then some of the stoic principles could certainly help  

i will just say this may sound rather dramatic but for me, this injury has been a huge part of my life for the past year (and still going) 

  i learnt to take more for granted, like going for a walk  by walking i could take in the surrounding countryside or unique architecture that in the past, on the same street, i might not have taken in fully 
  i really tried hard to separate my mind from my body, in a sense that my injury is physical, and doesn't affect my mind, my character and my will to overcome it  it's enough that my body has suffered an injury, i need my mind to remain strong  
  time is a healer  when the medicines prescribed seem to do nothing or the physio sessions seem to be going nowhere, i kept telling myself, give it time, i will eventually get better 
  i have to be indifferent to keeping fit and active  it's a hobby of mine and something i enjoy but there are heaps of other beautiful things you can take up and do in your leisure
  controlling the emotions  asking myself does getting annoyed, frustrated and upset give me more options? no, that road leads to a dead end, where trying to remain upbeat takes me down a road of recovery, i may not see the end but i sure know it's a more productive direction  moving forwards is better than not moving at all  
  shifting my perspective on the whole thing  sure the injury is stopping me from working out but in the meantime i can learn about the way the back muscles and spine is made up which once i'm back exercising i can utilize the new knowledge i know and try prevent injury again in the future 
  shrink my goals  instead of going from injured gt to fully back in the gym, i've learnt to accept smaller steps  stretching is my new norm, and when that loosen's me up i'll progress to an actual exercise  
  seeing the injury as a mental challenge to overcome  i want to beat it  
  take each day as it comes  if you're going through hell, keep going  

the main quote that i keep referring back to is 
''lock at a stonecutter hammering away at a rock  he hits the rock one hundred times without a crack showing in it  yet at the hundred and first blow the rock splits cleanly in two  realize it wasn't the last blow that did it, it was all the previous attempts that made it possible ''

and that to me is perseverance  on we go "

1,"how to ""get over yourself?"" i just want to know your mindsets in dealing with this? i've been in situations, where i just got to change my attitude and mindset, and the rest will figure itself out  but, i do get annoyed and frustrated in certain occasions throughout the day  and, i know i just have to get over myself, and let those things go  

 amp  x200b 

for, example, i'll be on a bus, and get annoyed when someone sits next to me, and tries to talk to me  i just have to take a breath, and be mindful, that they are just being nice  but, it's difficult, especially when i'm trying my best to be more stoic, and not to rush to my emotions in those cases

there needs to be ways to dealing with this  i was told i don't show this emotion, or temptation in my face when faced with the problems  it's just it's so easy to want to give in  i've been great at managing my withdrawal of engagement, but i don't think it's sustainable  if anyone has any pointers that would help!

1,"stoics' thought on minimalism and books? hello all! ive been going through my notebook and noticed that i tend to write long lists of books to read and sometime purchase a few when i have money 

however, ive been noticing while reading marcus amp seneca( def should be a band name fyi) that they speak heavily against hoarding books and promote reading a small selection of authors over and over and over again 

as a minimalist i agree with their notion, but believe books are essential in learning and developing our brains and should be obtained 

how do i reconcile the two? and do any of you know more quotes that supports either notions

1,"needing advice on ending a friendship so basically i've been studying stoicism as a hobby for a while now and i'm just starting to get really into it , my views on life and people are changing but i would like some advice so there's this guy who i work with lets just call him mr x , so mr x is provoking toxic and a verbal bully just to name a few so i've decided to stop being friendly with him and keep him more of a colleague but its not really me he's like that too it more of the other guys who i'm good friends with, its hard to watch them get belittled sometimes but its up to them if they can put up with it , i know where their coming from because he is a supervisor witch makes things more difficult,i haven't been aggressive in anyway shape or form ,he's noticed something wrong so he's been passive agrgressive towards me witch i'm glad to say i've been pretty much unfazed by it but i know soon he's going ask whats up ? i'm not 100 percent sure what i'm going to say, i want to tell the truth and  i'm not sure how to take the stoic approach , i know what ever i say it going to put me in the firing line and i'm okay with that because am not scared to stand up for myself thank you for reading "

1,"how should i deal with a toxic mother? as a stoic, i can very easily remove toxic people and situations from my life  i do not invest any mental or emotional energy into these decisions  i just remove the people who are detrimental to me living out my purpose  but in this instance, where the toxic person is my mother, i'm conflicted as what to do 

here is a brief background info   


as a child i was too immature to really pick up on the terrible things my mom did  but as i've become older i've learned a lot about her  

a few years ago i found out she had been cheating on my father for years and even got pregnant from another man, and then lied to my dad telling him it was his child  my dad never knew and raised my brother as he it were his own  a very honorable thing, and me and my brother are very close, and it doesn't change anything obviously  but i feel she really betrayed my dad by doing this 

she brought my dad into bankruptcy because she is an obsessive shopper   and then divorced my dad after he invested his life savings into renovating the home, kicking him out and keeping the new upgraded home for herself 

over my adult life, i've given her money on multiple occasions to save her from foreclosure and demanded she be more responsible with her money or i wouldn't help her again  she took that and labeled me as ""stingy"" and ""greedy"" for not helping her anymore financially 

this year in particular i lived with her for a few months because of covid and it's when her toxic personality started affecting me personally  i've been slowly noticing that she is a compulsive liar, extremely vengeful and very petty  

long story short, last week she stranded me in another country by removing me from her flight benefits and not telling me  (she is retired from a large airline company and she can have one other person listed to use her free flying privileges')  i found out last minute when i tried to book my flight and had to scramble to book something last minute at a very high price 

normally i just cut off anyone who is toxic  i don't invest any mental or emotional energy into them, and just remove them from my life  but, i can't really do that in this instance 

i don't want to speak to her, but i know that i also may end up regretting that, because we only get so much time with our mothers  

do i forgive her, and keep my distance?

i think this is the best course of action  i guess i should let go of my anger towards her and then keep my distance "
1,"stoicism helps in bad situations  i've been practicing stoicism since the pandemic started and with all things i've had my ups and downs  good days and bad, but i was shocked how well i've been able to handle loss now  my uncle died and however we weren't too close it provided the support i needed at the time 

and now it helps again, i learned last night that my best friend's mom pass away yesterday  she was like a second mother to me, and it hits harder when the autopsy report points to a potential murder 

i am not sure if i am in shock or i am just accepting that these things happen 

i keep thinking of marcus aurelius and all the losses he had gone through and thinking about how so many people have been through these things  i feel bad for my friends and i am angry with the situation but also oddly calm  

i just needed to share this, thanks for reading and sorry for the long post "

1,"i overthink in general but it really affects my romantic relationships  the irrational 

 i want to know where i stand in a relationship at all times   i hate uncertainty (in all cases), it drives me mad   i doubt myself even when i feel like a relationship is going well   i fear it will fall apart at any minute and that i am bound to make a mistake 

the rational 

 i feel so fucking dumb when i read the above because it is true   it's dumb to worry about where i stand in a relationship especially when it's impossible to know what someone is thinking   it is also dumb to worry about a relationship ending because if it does end, there's nothing i can do about it anyway so i might as well enjoy it while it lasts 

the body  

i have anxiety   
i am aware of this anxiety 
i understand my anxiety (the anxiety stems from a pattern of past relationships that ended when i thought things were fine)

1,"is this a part of stoic philosophy? a twist on memento mori idea that you ""owe it to yourself"" to live a full life because we will all die is central to stoic thought (memento mori)   i'm wondering if there exists within stoic philosophy the perspective that you should live life to the fullest not just in the name of  your own  mortality, but to live for those whose lives were cut short by war, disease, or atrocity  

the idea came to me in reading about various genocides and about the human cost of wars in the last century  these are people who weren't able to take advantage of the gift of life that was bestowed upon them  they had dreams, aspirations, friends  families as we all do as human beings, and i think that the fact that these things were taken from them prematurely should inspire us to live virtuously and without restraint

1,"we spend so much time in our heads or absurdity, then life, like a brief flash, has passed you by  your parents get old  they die  so do your grandparents 

your friends get married  you lose touch  

your get old yourself 

  and what did you really spend your life doing?   

look at the people on reddit  there is good, yes, but there's also endless argument, political or otherwise 

  think about the absurdity of all this          and how much we attribute meaning and importance to it  or even random arguments we have on a daily weekly basis, or the various strong emotions like petty anger or vengeance we seek to inflict on others, or the meaningless little goals we seek to fulfill   

  we do all this   but we don't live in the moment  we don't see our mother, our father, get old, get frail, and before we know it, they die    and then you wonder if you should maybe have lived in the moment and spent more time with them 

i know its maybe a common thought but it really hit me how you should savor the moment and how brief life is  i'm a millenial and feel old already  my parents are starting to look frail and death is smiling at them  my friends are looking old  getting married or having kids 

i feel like i spent my 20s in meaningless arguments, meaningless angst, meaningless suffering  and its gone, i'm now 31  

  don't you ever think about the modern capitalist world makes us feel like life is infinite due to the endless distractions and useless goals we are made to seek? the majority of us seem to live meaningless lives and we die at the end, bitter and wondering how the f it went by so fast   

we're so caught up in our little egotistical quests that we don't realise we're supposed to live  modern society has taken us so far from our animal nature (animals only live in the present) that we basically are incapable of savoring the moment and things like   memento mori   feel hollow until we see the face of our ageing parents or worse yet, their coffins 

how meaningless most of us are, how easily we waste our lives instead of living the most each day  most of us wake up too late, on our deathbeds or crying as our parents and loved ones die 

if you are in this situation mindset now, like i am, please change  please make the most of tomorrow  or you will cry of despair when you regret it later    focus on what truly matters  the internet and whatever the f is happening in reddit or politics doesn't     "

1,"us politics and stoicism so let me start by saying this will involve a tad bit of my political view in it but most it a run down of politics and stoicism   so let me start by saying i m neither right nor left wing, conservative or liberal, i am directly down the center of that beautiful bird we call freedom  i don t support either side in the trying time and nothing at all could get me to change that   i will however be voting come november, and i wanted to remind my fellow practitioners that is our duty as citizens of this country (usa) and citizens of the cosmos, to go out and vote to be the change that we want and that we strive for   
   for a while in the beginning the stoics felt the need to  perfect  their philosophy so it was mostly a classroom setting  well in 135 136 bce athens had decided to send philosophers to rome to try and diplomatically fix their issue and lower a fine that rome had levied against them  diogenes of babylon was sent as the stoic diplomat to try and convince them to be merciful through stoic rhetoric  it seemed to have worked they lowers the fine against them  this though was almost like a turning point for the school  many prominent stoics would later be an integral part of politics in ancient rome, from cato the younger and his daughter porcia to seneca and the  philosopher king  marcus aurelius  the stoics (most of them any how) would have gladly laid their lives down to ensure that tyranny never ruled  cato went as far as suicide as he could not stand to live under the rule of julius caesar  
     if the ancient stoics can do this, if they can lay down their lives, risk their lives, risk exile, then the least you can do is go out and vote, now only is it your right it s you obligation as a free person in a country where we are still (for the time being) allowed to vote  
    i leave you on this though, if you pick for circus leader does not get voted in then you did all you could do and there is no use in complaining about it  and if the one who does get pick threatens us with tyranny remember that the stoics were not the kind to retreat and hide they were in fact fighters  thank you all for being on this path with me and may you all have a good rest of your day "

1,"slow and steady! lately, i feel i've been constantly put to the test, to show what i've learnt so far, to show how these things are in real life  although, when i'm in the contest, i often do not readily realise it  i mostly do so when it's over and then i realize that i have either acted well or i haven't 

just recently, i did a business with a relative with the last cash i had on me  when he disappointed me by telling a story that was poorly rehearsed, and i had nothing left in my account, i reminded myself that i could be happy regardless, that this was nothing strange, that where i placed my value was quite different from where others place theirs, i left a message since he wasn't taking my calls and the message was  not to spite him but to try to convey to him that the right thing is the best thing   although this has not brought my money back, but then i feel victorious 

again i went to the market and i was convinced to get something that was not originally budgeted for, turned out the purchase was not worth it in the end, i was duped  to me, this was a contest i lost  i didn't blame myself for being duped, i blamed myself for not staying the course for which i have set in my mind  i allowed external things affect my judgement  i let down my guard 

today on my way to work, i mistakenly dropped my purse that contained several important stuff  by the time i realized this, i was already at the office so,i checked that i had my id card and my token to log on for work  i was contented with this  i needed cash but my debit card was in the purse  so i went to the bank,blocked the card and got a new one  fine my day could proceed  some of my colleagues who were aware of the matter felt pity for me, but then my mood was light and i told them "" don't worry about me, i'm hopeful that someone will call me but if they don't, that's fine too"" (i had an id with my phone number on it in the purse)  just before i left the office, someone called me that they found the purse  how quickly did i then recall that in this matter, i was victorious  not because of the call but because of my attitude with respect to the situation 

i hope not to make any mistakes twice, and i call on life to challenge me more 

i'm not perfect, but then, i believe i'm making progress, not as fast, but then slowly and steadily  this is fine for me

1,how to practice stoicism in three simple steps  removed 
1,"on why we shouldn't try to suppress our emotions but only control our reaction to them  ""i did something i hadn t done in fifteen years of oncology  i grieved with my team  how? our team gathered together   doctors, nurses, support staff, and even administrators   and with the guidance of our social workers, we shared what we were feeling about recent patient losses  we listened to each other  we cried together  i allowed my team to see a vulnerable side of myself, the side that had been told since medical school never to show herself, or else  or else what? because here s the thing, nothing bad happened  in fact, good things happened  both social workers thanked me afterward for my candor and for  being willing to show emotion  in front of the team because, they said, it gave the rest of the team permission to show their emotions, too  wow, i thought, does that mean before this grief session, my team didn t think i felt the same things that they did surrounding patient loss?  

then i realized that from our first days of medical school, doctors are conditioned to hide their emotions away  to suppress and conceal  and because i hadn t ever spoken to my team about my grief over patient losses before, they assumed i didn t experience it to the same degree  suppressing these feelings kind of made me feel less than human, which is definitely not the way i want to be perceived by my team (or my patients) ""

from jennifer lycette's  article (   allowing grief  is integration better than compartmentalization?  

this, in my opinion, is a great reminder that we shouldn't seek to suppress all negative emotions or hide them necessarily  instead, our goal should be to express them wisely "

1,"my favorite faq point and how i can apply it   rewriting exercise man am i happy i found this group  as i was reading through the faq, one point really resonated with me  it's so simple, so obvious, yet i have failed to make this realization in the self actualization part of my life  without further ado 

""regular rewording of such reminders to trigger active engagement and prevent them from becoming ""just words ""

so simple, yet i never do this  i don't care what kind of way you're trying to help yourself, from weight loss to learning to whatever, this is a major key to effectiveness  without this aspect, nothing (or very little) of what you have learned will stick  how many of us have read a self help book, felt motivated, then after a few weeks, forget every single thing about the book  

i learned a language last year how did i do it ? i studied every day for 45 minites  i didn't learn a word and then say, ""oh cool, i got it, i remember this forever""  nope  usually i would see the word and it's translation   then, use it to answer a practice question  then, maybe see it in further reading  then hear someone say it and make the connection  then finally after several times of being exposed to that word, i would say it while speaking and bam, then i had the word almost permanently and it was actually ""learned ""

the point being, to learn anything it takes time and repetition   i never made this connection when it comes to bettering myself or learning new beliefs or ways of being  but with everything else i learn, i have this mentality  

i'm sure there's others who have done this but didn't make the connection so i hope reading this can help you to put the new knowledge more into a learned self component  


my action steps now 

1 spend the next few days solidifying some of my favorite lines from, ""meditations"" and also get into writing the main things i want to work on about myself and include why  

2 before my daily language practice and piano practice, i'm going to spend 15 minutes meditating on these  i'll read them, rewrite them, and see if i can develop them more  

3 rinse and repeat 

i think this will be the start to me eliminating some bad habits that prevent me from reaching my full potential  not a magic pill, but the foundation for the work i need to do on myself  this will help to make more clear what i want, how to get it, what to avoid, and why i want it  thanks for reading "
1,"good morning my fellow practitioners good morning everyone,

so i have been up all night listening to ""lives of the stoics""   by ryan holiday, and i must say that i cannot recommend it enough   i am often critical of  mr  holiday, i find him to have many contradictions in his videos and podcasts   that being said i think everyone should pick up a copy of ""lives of the stoics""   he covers the history of the stoics (or at least the most notable) in really great detail   it is a reminder that we are humans and though we may strive to be a stoic sage, even zeno fell victim to wanting to seek revenge   i must say that i think that mr  holiday knocked this one out of the park   i was unaware of a lot of this, and i'm grateful for his work on this book   if anyone has read this i would be very happy to discuss it with you in private messages "
1,"what stoicism asks of newcomers i like to think that stoicism can work for anybody, regardless of background  however, it doesn't work well for everybody regardless of  effort   stoicism is hard work, and depending on your background it can require a whole paradigm shift and literally re wiring your brain  coming here, slapping a problem down on our helpdesk ( s) and saying ""fix this with a quote"" is not the way to go about getting into stoicism  we have a  faq ( for a reason(and it's also a good place to ask ""where to do i begin?"" questions)  

i want to post the whole of  enchiridion 29 ( but the back half really sums it up  ""   do you think that you can act as you do, and be a philosopher?     that you can eat and drink, and be angry and discontented as you are now? you must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintance, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those you meet  come off worse than others in everything, in magistracies, in honors, in courts of judicature  when you have considered all these things round, approach, if you please  if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase equanimity, freedom, and tranquillity      if not, don't come here  don't, like children, be one while a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of caesar's officers      these things are not consistent  you must be one man, either good or bad  you must cultivate either your own ruling faculty or externals, and apply yourself either to things within or without you  that is, be either a philosopher, or one of the vulgar "" 

if you are really serious about stoicism, you need to learn to totally let go of externals, at least at the beginning  epictetus says over and over that you really need to master the dichotomy of control and your internals before you can even consider pursuing externals  consider enchiridion 13  "" if you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid with regard to external things  don't wish to be thought to know anything  and even if you appear to be somebody important to others, distrust yourself  for, it is difficult to both keep your faculty of choice in a state conformable to nature, and at the same time acquire external things  but while you are careful about the one, you must of necessity neglect the other ""  and enchiridion 2  ""   but, for the present, totally suppress desire  for, if you desire any of the things which are not in your own control, you must necessarily be disappointed  and of those which are, and which it would be laudable to desire, nothing is yet in your possession      use only the appropriate actions of pursuit and avoidance  and even these lightly, and with gentleness and reservation "" 

i don't mean to come off as an ass, and i'm definitely not advocating for any sort of newcomer question ban  i still think it's better to ask than to not, but   

  tl dr   if you are actually serious about stoicism and actually want good, thoughtful answers, then you you should ask good, thoughtful questions  if you want to see results, then you need to be willing to put the work in  either way, welcome 

cheers  )"
1,"virtue and wisdom have brought nothing i ve seen several therapists and like 4 psychiatrists, been on a bunch of different medications, and none of it helps  

my core belief, the one that cannot ever be changed by ect, therapy, medications, family, or any remaining friendships, is that there is nothing i want more than suicide  no amount of positive thinking or cbt or dbt changes that i want to die  nothing will ever change that, and i dont want it to change  i want to kill myself and not be judged or stopped 

i ve tried suicide several times, but unfortunately get my stomach pumped or am reported before i get to attempt  i ve been to several psych hospitals, including yale, and am still just as hopeless and worthless at the beginning  nothing has changed my mind, only wasted my time  if anyone besides the terminally ill should qualify for euthanasia, it should be the people who don t want to be alive  the people like me, who can t and won t be helped

1,"how do i determine what is and isn t in my control? i m a bit new to this, and i ve seen advice that tells me to not to worry about things that i can t control  

i m a bit of a frivolous person, i always like trying new things and throwing myself into them  i m also of the disposition that people telling themselves they can t do something is wrong 

i have a habit where i try and solve problems that other people give up on  like, when someone says that they don t get a problem because they re just bad at it makes me want to sit them down and figure it out with them, because the human brain is an amazing work of art and you re just making assumptions about yourself out of frustration and     you get the idea 

so, when do i stop worrying about it? if it s someone else s opinion, i can try changing it  if it s something too hard for me i can try and learn to get better at it  if it s something i hate i can try changing my perspective on it 

no one would disagree with that, so with all that said, when is it not my problem? when is it useless to worry about? do i just have an ego problem? i m curious "

1,"what are the thoughts of stoic philosophers on ghost? i know, it may sound strange but bear with me  i know ghosts are externals and thus, the stoic philosophers of the past probably would regard them as not their concern 

so last night, i was dreaming and a ghost appeared in my dream  she was a little girl with white plain dress and long black hair covering her face  like normal people, i'll get scared if a sudden apparition appeared before me 

but the thing is, in my dream, i did feel the fear appear within me  but i did not react with fear, rather, i shrugged it off and calmly confronted the ghost and walked before it and even tried to touch it  i thought at that moment that it wasn't real, that it was an external and thus could not harm me, for the only thing that could harm me was my own thought  when i woke up, the tingling fear was still there, but i was calm 

this was a very profound experience for me  i've been practicing stoicism for a year now  i failed a lot and i always tried to maintain my virtue and the dichotomy of control  to know that even at my dream, when almost all sense of conscious self is gone, i acted with virtue, was very cool 

so it also made me think  ghosts has been a part of human experience for as far as we can remember  did any of the stoics wrote anything about them?"

1,"objective perception  perception is what makes you you  perception is what is going to decide on your actions when confronted to circumstances  the way you intercept the world and your surroundings was formed since the day you were born  you were born into a place with people that also got their own perception which also formed itself over the course of their lives  the found circumstances of your early life are going to depict themselves onto your new found perception, what you experience is what you're going to feel and act like, you adapt  since this world couldn't be any more different from life to life from individual to individual, every man's perception and perspective on this world is going to be different from one another, of course, we are going to search and find some people who got the same opinions and worldviews than we do, but our core perception, is going to be unique  

this said it would be easy to say that people are victims of circumstances since they couldn't decide on the place they were going to grow up in, which is true to some extent, but on the other hand an individual not only has an unique perception, but has an unique mind too which affects their perception to a noticeable degree  the perception of an individual is being shaped by the mind of one, the mind is what is there in the first place, early experiences and opinions are being processed by one's unique mind which translate to a subjective perception of it's surroundings  likewise the perception, the mind is getting shaped by surroundings, but contrary to the perspective, the mind is able to perceive objectively, thus, able not to fall victim to it's circumstances  that said it is still very unlikely for an individual aged from 0 to 10 to be able to integrate an objective point of view into his life without the knowledge of it's existence 

as the years pass we experience, we learn, we adapt, each year we live through having a substantial impact on our general mindset and perception  we could say that, if an individual spends twenty years exposed to constant subjectivity, you can with a pretty high certainty expect that said individual isn't living up to it's full potential  the reason for it being that full potential can only be reached through full objective concentration of your gathered knowledge and skills on the continuity of growth of your knowledge and skills, which is close to impossible when subjectivity envelops your perception and overall mindset  the reason for it being like that is that subjectivity doesn't allow you to see things as they really are, you're able too see small portions, but the bigger picture, even when being right in front of your eyes, remains hidden 

subjectivity consistently influences the way you think, it influences your your interior and exterior decision making constantly by giving your brain input of past experiences that conclude a possible outcome of a situation  meaning that, a situation, with someone who you've never met, somewhere you've never been, already has a subjective outcome  despite it being completely new and unfamiliar to you, your perception already intercepted something that it would judge either good or bad and will accordingly notify your brain about it's discovery  your brain is going to pass the message to your subconsciousness which is going to reflect itself onto your actions, thus, limiting the accessibility of tenant able neutral objective emotional ground  the neutral ground is supposed to be the foundation on which you are building up new experiences, that in the future, will influence your perception, but in a far less subjective, way more ''unprejudiced'' manner  this unprejudiced manner of perceiving your surroundings allows your character to grow  instead of living with past persuasions, we live to seek assent to our prejudices and subjective beliefs  only this way are we able to perceive the world from angles that were yet hidden from us by strong past subjective perceptual restrictions 

through neutrality and objectivity the bigger picture reveals itself

i feel like i am in a toxic relationship, but at the same time we ve both been trying to be better for each other  

i notice that to be happy in my relationship, i ask him to act this way instead of this, so we can have better communication

at first it was very difficult to sit still for that long  but after the first week, i started to truly realise that all of my problems were in my own head  i was perceiving things poorly, from past images that i'd clung onto 

reading wisdom from the main 3 stoic philosophers, jiddu krishnamurti and naval ravikant each day also helped to rewire my mind, giving me useful stuff to meditate on  i now realise that living in the past causes depression and living in the future causes anxiety  discovering for myself that this is true makes me almost unconsciously stay present   and i feel much better for it 

i am currently learning to code and as a practice project i made a meditation app that i am now using myself  it's based on doing 60 days of meditation, 1hr   day  at the beginning, only day 1 is unlocked  after meditating for at least 15 mins, the next day is unlocked  each day has some advice quotes from the philosophers i mentioned before 

complete a 30 min session to be awarded 1 star, 45 mins for 2 stars and 60 or more for 3 stars  there are bonus unlockable tao meditations for total stars and day streaks 

this video demonstrates the app   

if anybody is interested in using this, i just put it on the play store

maybe i could sweep the floor more, or clean the bathroom, or wash my own clothes, yet i don t get told  i would if i did get told  i ve tried to offer in the past but my mum told me to not worry about it  my mums boyfriend does not consider how much we do, and when my grandparents come to visit they feel sorry for us  but if anybody tells him their opinion, or if my siblings or i speak of the things we do, he ll bark back at us and may enforce more labels onto us or find more things to speak of so he gets the last word, whether there relevant things or not  he may pick on me and speak of little mistakes or things he doesn t like such as the fact that i mate rar sound counselling headphones when i exit the room (however very rarely i do), because i have autism and struggle with noise   

i m happy if we are asked to help out more, yet i m not happy that he accuses my siblings and myself as being lazy and unhelpful  and f someone shades opinions he utterly despise it  he tried to parent us as well a if he s our dad  he ll demand my brother to brush his teeth if he doesn t, my mum doesn t  he ll be mad if we have a sleep in on our day off, my mum doesn t think of it as a bad thing yet she wouldn t express her opinions either because she may face the same consequences as us  i don t stand to die my siblings much because i know i ll be in trouble and my anxiety will go up  i may defend myself politely, where necessary, however he just gets more angry and find other ways to pick at me, relevant or not  

my mums partner will often have bite at us when he is frustrated or feels like he can  it s rare he tells us politely to help out he d only stress that we are lazy  this happens nearly every week  if we have a meeting which is rare he promises us that he ll make us do more

however my main problem with the practice is uncertainty, doubt, and lack of conviction 

there are some days where i would be so sure of what i'm doing, where i would set my mind on virtue, reject vice, and be able to deal with impressions well and premeditate on any adversity which can come  but a lot of days is spent in uncertainty  i would wonder, ""do i truly understand stoicism?"" i would doubt myself on any decision i made even if i tried to make them with virtuous intent, i would be uncertain about a lot of core principles that i've instilled long ago (why be virtuous? why help others? why practice this and that?)

 amp  x200b 

one of the things i don't understand are some parts of ""if it's out of your control, don't worry about it"" as one of the things out of our control is what other people think  but does that mean we should not try and convince them what is right wrong? additionally, with that mindset how would we have people who break the barriers, for example    (this may be a bad example) but if someone wanted a better light source and hated was not satisfied with their current situation, then they may have developed invented several things such as nikola tesla   that might be a bad example so i'll write another one  steve jobs was very nit picky and if some things weren't perfect in the iphone he would have someone fix it until it was perfect  if he did not like something in our world, instead of thinking ""well that is out of my control"" he would instead try to figure out how to further improve or invent something that would benefit him   


for some reason my interpretation of the stoic mindset is that you should be cool headed, think logically   but also not be super motivated   kind of just go with the flow  i'm not sure if i don't understand something here and there is a lot more i don't get but if you understand what i mean please do explain it to me "

1,"dichotomy of cognition   cognition   is commonly defined as the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses  if we can't think of it, if we can't experience it, if we can't sense it then it isn't knowable  it will be mere imagination or fantasy, fiction even  but we usually carry this fiction to heart because we find it fanciful against the reality of pure natural experience  the things outiside our cognition cannot disturb us, because we cannot even sense them 

  some things are within our cognition, while others are not    

we tend to think we know much more than we can truly understand  this common mistake leads to distortions and false judgements, which take the mind into unnecessary disturbances  

do you think you know the future with certainty? do you think you know the past with certainty? do you think you know yourself with certainty? at least, certainly, we are used to acting as if we do 

  you don't know what happens when people die   

you've recited memento mori to heart, but what it means is rather subjective  some think they will depart to paradise  some think they will simply sleep forever  some say they come back in another body  if there is certainty about death it is not just that it will come, it's that it's mysterious  perhaps too mysterious for most  can you accept this ignorance? 

  you don't know the ideal society   

how many times have we been through this? how many times have wise men proposed dramatic reforms, radical teardowns of customs, and endeavoured into bringing perfection to life? who can even know these things? and even if it works well for a while, human entropy is such that ignorance grows no matter what, and great laws are forgotten 

  you don't know power   

if i just had more power i would be happy   says the naive one  how can you know what having power will do to you if you've never had it? what is it about controlling others that excites you? have you ever even controlled your own mind? that would be real power, power you could actually know something about if you tried 

  you don't know science   

not even science knows science  the best theories are not truths  not even approximations of truth  they are simulations of truth  has anyone seen differential equations crossing by the moon above telling it where to go? one day even einstein will be dethroned by a new simulation  of course, follow the best scientific advice if you will  next month they will have a new one  next year they will have a different one  is this fruitless? not so  it's merely the acceptance of our ignorance  we know as much as we can try, but we have to try  just don't become a fool by thinking you know it all   or even know it  at all  

  all we can know is this present moment 

right now you're alive  at the moment you have time to reflect  in this instant you're not suffering  all we can tell is what is happening, not what has happened nor what will  history reads like a fairy tale  predictions read like the sayings of madmen  can we learn from fairy tales? sure, great morals and lessons, but it's always obvious it comes from the bias of the author  can we prepare ourselves against the predicted doom that's coming? if you can  they've been wrong so many times before it's almost funny  one day they will be right, but by the mere accident that if you predict something every day, one day it will happen "

 epictetus, enchiridion, 13a

most of society seems to have taken it as a commandment that one must know about every single current event, watch every episode of every critically acclaimed television series, follow the news religiously, and present themselves to others as an informed and worldly individual 

but where is the evidence that this is actually necessary? is the obligation enforced by the police? or is it that you re just afraid of seeming silly at a dinner party? 

how much more time, energy, and pure brainpower would you have available if you drastically cut your media consumption? how much more rested and present would you feel if you were no longer excited and outraged by every scandal, breaking story, and potential crisis (many of which never come to pass anyway)?"

1,"i think i figured out stoic depression  i think an analogy would be best to describe what i think  so reader, have you ever had appendicitis? appendicitis is an infection of the appendix  my family member's appendicitis was bad  it first was a mild pain until the infection spread, it became agonizing  eventually their appendix burst  now, a burst appendix could very easily be a death sentence, if the infection spread to other parts of the body there would be no chance of fighting it off  fortunately, in this case their body created a wall around the burst appendix, which contained the infection and allowed the infection to be fought off  after surgery to remove the appendix they made a speedy recovery 

i think depression is like this infection, except it doesn't spread the same way  depression spreads through vice  it's like a lie, you tell one lie it leads to two more and eventually you're overwhelmed with lies  with depression, you give in to one vice, for me it was calling off from work because i couldn't get out of bed  then i did it a few times, next eventually quitting my job and inevitably then living in a car  it's at this point depression has spread to every aspect of my life and fighting it off was even more difficult then it would be at the start (i'm well now if it is important to you)  if you let the infection spread through your whole body it will be near impossible to fight it off  you have to wall it off so your body can fight it off  of course if depression spreads through vice then to wall it off you need virtue  if you retain your virtue, and wall off the infection then your body will fight it off with time 

when it comes to toxic people, drug abuse, neglecting daily care, over indulgence, reclusive behavior, etc   if you allow these vices into your life they will spread through out  it takes immense strength to avoid these, and with any battle you gain ground and you lose ground  but you can win "
1,"i'm not afraid of dying but i'm afraid of the pain that it might bring to my loved ones with the whole pandemic going around i've started thinking about what would happen if i had it and also if i couldn't survive it  if i had it i wouldn't be afraid to die from it but since death isn't something everyone really sees that often it's hard to tell how you or someone else would respond to it  if a loved one died i know i would feel sad but i know i can get through it one way or another  but i am still young and it's hard to imagine me dying, whether it's from the virus or from something else entirely, and find a way in which people like my parents wouldn't take it so well  and it's also not just from the virus but i start to think about any other way i could die  it doesn't scare me to think about dying, i think about it all the time, and stoicism teaches you that death isn't something you can control, and it's part of nature, therefore you should welcome it whenever it decides to come  and i agree but my biggest fear is that if i die before anyone else in my family, they will take it very badly and who knows what the death of a son or brother might do to a person  some people handle it well but others are maybe too attached to the deceased that it may jeopardize their happiness, their choices, and maybe even their will to live  i'm not saying that i'm the only reason my family is alive, but i'm saying that i recognize the feelings they have for me and i worry about them and whether or not they'll manage in the case that i do die  cause nobody knows what's gonna happen and i think it's important to prepare for anything  i don't really know what question i should ask about this, but anything that might help me and ease my state of mind would be greatly appreciated "

the  2000 pc comes with lots of perks  like videogaming, and other fun cpu hogging stuff like video editing and more intensive architecture designs  although, you can be frugal and do none of that

1,"how does a stoic act in self defense? stoicism practices keeping emotions in check and not acting on anything without thinking of repercussions and our actions first  so what about a self defense situation? if a man threatens our life whether at knife or gun point or even a brawl, do we accept that we are here at this point in life? taking the beating, wound, or even death? do we speak to the man and try to help him see the error of his ways, even though his understanding is out of our control? or do we fight? protecting ourselves, and at what point do we know is too much? if they were to take my life, should i do the same? or aim to the most peaceful approach possible? do any of the ancient stoics we learn from ever speak on the subject? how did they view self defense?"

when i express myself, oftentimes she will not be content with it  i always be fair and virtuous  i don t blame or point the finger but i will say hoe i ve been feeling about something

1,stoic quotes that will turn around your life 
1,"the five deadly sins of stoicism (meditations 2 16, long translation) the soul of man does violence to itself when 

  it becomes an abscess and, as it were, a tumor on the universe, so far as it can  for to be vexed at anything which happens is a separation of ourselves from nature, in some part of which the natures of all other things are contained 
  it turns away from any man, or even moves towards him with the intention of injuring, such as are the souls of those who are angry 
  it is overpowered by pleasure or by pain  
  it plays a part, and does or says anything insincerely and untruly  
  it allows any act of its own and any movement to be without an aim, and does anything thoughtlessly and without considering what it is, it being right that even the smallest things be done with reference to an end  and the end of rational animals is to follow the reason and the law of the most ancient city and polity

if one has values or wants to tend their virtues, one must have principles  if one has honesty as their value, unless it is put to practice, it means nothing  i use   principles as instruments  , with which i can practice my values and virtues  with principles, i can put my values to work 

i'd like for you to share what principles you have, what rules in life you try to follow, what habits are important for you, because i and other readers might like to try them also  here's some of my mine  (the format is `value   gt  principle` )

    love   gt  be kinder to others than you were yesterday

kindness has no cost and it can only add to the well being of everybody  i can't deny that i could be a little more kinder to the people i meet every day  i find it most interesting to practice this with people i don't know  with the clerk at the supermarket, with a waiter in a restaurant, with a random person i have eye contact in the street 

    authenticity   gt  do not discuss about things you already know

this comes mainly from  enchiridion ( which has multiple points on the matter  i try not to speak about things that have happened to be  i strive to be present on what i feel  right now , what my views are  at this very moment  and  why  are these things true to me  this principle also leads me to interrupt people if they themselves are ruminating or i'm having difficulties connecting with them for some other reason 

    honesty   gt  never lie

in no circumstance do i lie  also, if i feel that somebody has a false impression on something, usually considering me (most importantly on what i did, or what i intend to do but also what i think) i'm obliged to set it straight  this principle leads to radically awkward situations and i love it  (i can, of course, always answer to a question with "" i don't feel like telling you right now "", which is true and in line with the principle )

    good judgement   gt  write every day

journaling has shown itself to be transformative practice  for me, it works to do it in the morning, and i can always return to it later in the day if i need  additionally, i have a rule that "" one sentence is enough ""  it also helps me to keep in mind that skipping or failing once is natural, but twice is the beginning of a new habit

1,"have you made mistakes in life?   well, that's fine   gt consider this then that to borrow money is not sufficient to make a man a debtor but add to this that he continues to owe the money and refuses to pay, he then becomes a debtor   so it is not enough to compel you to admit the inference that you have granted the premisses, but you must abide by what you have granted  indeed, if the premisses continue to the end such as they were when they were granted, it is absolutely necessary for us to abide by what we have granted, and we must accept their consequences  but if the premisses do not remain such as they were when they were granted, it is absolutely necessary for us also to withdraw from what we granted, and from accepting what does not follow from the words in which our concessions were made  for the inference is now not our inference, nor does it result with our assent, since we have withdrawn from the premisses which we granted 
 epictetus discourses book i chapter 7

sometimes, we get an overwhelming feeling of guilt because of certain things we have done or certain mishaps that arose due to our decisions in the past most of which we blindly granted without knowing what would follow after  epictetus is saying that nothing done out of error is our fault or blamable on ourselves  the only time these things become our fault is if we continue in the path of error after it has been discovered  so, we must immediately withdraw from false beliefs, false opinions and false actions when we discover them, no one is above mistakes and every mistake is an opportunity to learn not a reason to feel down

1,"how to journal with stoicism hello dear community,

i've started with stoicism about 6 months ago reading seneca and marcus aurelius, 2 months ago i started journaling my stoic and overall experience of the day the morning after, i'm also reading a page of the daily stoic while journaling

i practice to view my days as separate lifes and think about them every evening and what i'll take into the ""next life"" tomorrow, this was a great addition to my life because it made me review and reevaluate a lot of day to day routines

now during working days i start my day around 3 30am working from home until the wife and my son wakes up at around 6 00 am, after preparing breakfast i sit down and write my journal for the past day

i tried journaling on the evenings but i couldn't stick to it so the morning fits me better, however maybe because of a few hours sleep and being occupied already with 2 hours work i just feel like journaling doesn't give me much value  there are days where i don't know what i should write down from yesterday and can't really see the practical meaning in the daily stoic, it tends to become something i have to do rather then want to do because i don't really see a meaning in it  however i know that journaling helps me a lot on different things already, because i do it for different subjects on a weekly or  daily basis  but with a journal for practicing stoicism   i guess i just haven't found my way


anyone here has a good journaling habit or any other good experience with journaling for this stoic endeavor? i would love to hear about that, what questions do you ask yourself, do you implement daily exercise? i really would like to hear your ideas

while writing this post i thought about making a weekly instead of a daily journal and just do one exercise a week everyday and write one paragraph per day how i did and how i felt with it   maybe this is something worth trying as well

anyway, i'm looking forward to your response"

now it seems like my brain is too slow to be good at anything i try to do  i don't feel competent at my career or my hobbies  i also think i could be a better relationship partner and a better father  i believe that because of the success i had early in life, being ""mediocre"" is unacceptable to my ego  i'm struggling

1,"i don t travel when i take pto at work and here s why  at a very basic level, seneca and other stoic s teach us that only what we can control on the inside can bring us happiness, not the external world  how can we be happy when our happiness relies on things we can control? when you take away those things you are left as unhappy you started  

that s why i don t take frantic vacations to the bahamas, or cancun, or europe, or anywhere that instagram demands we go in order to be happy  because at the end of the day if you re spending the year getting your hopes up and being miserable just so you can spend two weeks out of 52 to see the eiffel tower, you ll be unhappy and miserable when you go back to your office, and then you ll be planning your next big vacation to forget about things

i ve seen this play out for all my friends  they post their exotic vacations on instagram and show the world how happy they were for one week out of a whole year, and it got me thinking 

do i really want to be that guy that needs to go to exotic vacations in order to be happy? do i really want my happiness contingent on which monument i got to see or touch this year? or do i want inner happiness, every day of the year? 

i find peace of mind reading books about these places, the history, the science  i don t need to spend thousands every year to be happy

i chanced upon this quote on a medium article i read "" hope is dangerous  yes, things can get better, but they can also get worse  hope creates expectations of improvement  expectations that will knock you down when you don t meet them  instead of telling people their lives could get better, stoics told people their life could get worse  "" 

deep down i know the path but yet this path is not without struggle  i want to be someone that does not pursue things that do not matter and things i know are wrong for me 

 if today were the last day of my life, would i want to do what i m about to do today? "

closer than most to you and,

what am i supposed to do,

take it away,

i never had it anyway,

    her life doesn t belong to him  not something within his control   

take it away,

and everything will be okay 

    his life will continue without her, he still lives   

in you a star is born and,

you cut a perfect form and,

someone forever warm,

lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on,

lay on, lay on, lay on, lay on 

    this girl was great, but he s got to carry on with his life   

way upon the mountain where she died,

    he put her up on a pedestal and she couldn t live up to those expectations   

all i ever wanted was your life,

    this line is sarcastic  her life is not something he should want nor something she can give, that is too much to ask, this was his mistake   

deep inside the canyon i can't hide,

     he is not able to hide from the pain of loss, so he faces it instead  the obstacle is the way   

show love with no remorse and,

     don t let this loss affect how you deal with others, keep living virtuously   

climb on to your seahorse and,

this ride is right on course,

     fate is playing out as it should (not sure about the seahorse lol)   

this is the way,

i wanted it to be with you,

this is the way,

i knew that it would be with you,

1,"takeaways from on old age by cicero (stoic views on how to appreciate getting older) while not among his best known works, cicero s on old age (de senectute) offers sagely advice on why one should not fear growing older  quotes taken from the loeb classics library translation  

    1  old age is not unique in being burdensome 

 gt  i think, my friends, that you marvel at a thing really far from difficult      for to those who have not the means within themselves of a virtuous and happy life every age is burdensome      and, on the other hand, to those who seek all good from themselves nothing can seem evil that the laws of nature inevitably impose      to this class old age especially belongs, which all men wish to attain and yet reproach when attained  such is the inconsistency and perversity of folly!     
 gt   
 gt  they say that it stole upon them faster than they had expected  in the first place, who has forced them to form a mistaken judgement? for how much more rapidly does old age steal upon youth than youth upon childhood? and again, how much less burdensome would old age be to them if they were in their eight hundredth rather than in their eightieth year?     in fact, no lapse of time, however long, once it had slipped away, could solace or soothe a foolish old age      

    2    but it is only praiseworthy if the life preceding it was well spent 

 gt  but bear well in mind that in this entire discussion     i am praising that old age which has its foundation well laid in youth      hence it follows   as i once said with the approval of all who heard it   that that old age is wretched which needs to defend itself with words! nor can wrinkles and grey hair suddenly seize upon influence      but when the preceding part of life has been nobly spent, old age gathers the fruits of influence at the last        
 gt   
 gt  for if the ills of which they complained were the faults of old age, the same ills would befall me and all other old men  but i have known many who were of such a nature that they bore their old age without complaint, who were not unhappy because they had been loosed from the chains of passion, and who were not scorned by their friends      but as regards all such complaints, the blame rests with character, not with age      for old men of self control, who are neither churlish nor ungracious, find old age endurable  while     on the other hand        perversity and an unkindly disposition render irksome every period of life    (  
 gt   
 gt  undoubtedly, scipio and laelius,     the most suitable defenses of old age are the principles and practice of the virtues    , which, if cultivated in every period of life, bring forth wonderful fruits at the close of a long and busy career, not only because they never fail you even at the very end of life   although that is a matter of highest moment   but also     because it is most delightful to have the consciousness of a life well spent and the memory of many deeds worthily performed      

    3    and the mind and body sufficiently prepared 

 gt    but it is our duty, my young friends, to resist old age      to compensate for its defects by a watchful care  to fight against it as we would fight against disease  to adopt a regimen of health  to practice moderate exercise  and to take just enough of food and drink to restore our strength and not to overburden it  nor, indeed, are we to give our attention solely to the body      much greater care is due to the mind and soul  for they, too, like lamps, grow dim with time, unless we keep them supplied with oil      
 gt   
 gt  for when caecilius speaks of   the old fools of the comic stage,  he has in mind old men characterized by credulity, forgetfulness, and carelessness, which are faults, not of old age generally, but only of an old age that is drowsy, slothful, and inert  

    4  if prepared in this way, old age contributes more to the world that it s youth 

 gt  those, therefore, who allege that old age is devoid of useful activity adduce nothing to the purpose, and are like those who would say that the pilot does nothing in the sailing of the ship, because, while others are climbing the masts, or running about the gangways, or working at the pumps, he sits quietly in the stern and simply holds the tiller    
 gt   
 gt  he may not be doing what younger members of the crew are doing, but what he does is better and much more important       it is not by muscle, speed, or physical dexterity that great things are achieved, but by reflection, force of character, and judgement    ( in these qualities old age is usually not only not poorer but is even richer  

    5  old age should not fear the nearness of death as it is not unique to old age 

 gt    and yet is there anyone so foolish, even though he is young, as to feel absolutely sure that he will be alive when evening comes    ? nay, even youth, much more than old age, is subject to the accident of death  the young fall sick more easily, their sufferings are more intense, and they are cured with greater difficulty    
 gt   
 gt  therefore,     few arrive at old age    , and, but for this, life would be lived in better and wiser fashion  for it is in old men that reason and good judgement are found, and had it not been for old men no state would have existed at all    
 gt   
 gt  but i return to the question of impending death      what fault is this which you charge against old age, when, as you see, it is one chargeable likewise to youth?     that death is common to every age has been brought home to me by the loss of my dearest son    
 gt   
 gt  they say, also, that the old man has nothing even to hope for      yet he is in better case than the young man    , since what the latter merely hopes for, the former has already attained      the one wishes to live long, the other has lived long      

    6    and a life well lived lives well beyond its own years 

 gt  the actor, for instance, to please his audience need not appear in every act to the very end  it is enough if he is approved in the parts in which he plays  and so      it is not necessary for the wise man to stay on this mortal stage to the last fall of the curtain    ( for even if the allotted space of life be short, it is long enough in which to live honorably and well  but if a longer period of years should be granted, one has no more cause to grieve than the farmers have that the pleasant springtime has passed and that summer and autumn have come    
 gt   
 gt  would it not have been far better for me to spend a leisured and quiet life, free from toil and strife?     but somehow, my soul was ever on the alert, looking forward to posterity, as if it realized that when it had departed from this life, then at last would it be alive      

    7    with nothing to regret when its course has been run 

 gt    for what advantage has life   or, rather, what trouble does it not have?     but even grant that it has great advantage, yet undoubtedly it has either satiety or an end  i do not mean to complain of life as many men, and they learned ones, have often done      nor do i regret that i have lived, since i have so lived that i think i was not born in vain    , and i quit life as if it were an inn, not a home  for nature has given us an hostelry in which to sojourn, not to abide    
 gt   
 gt    for as nature has marked the bounds of everything else, so she has marked the bounds of life      moreover, old age is the final scene, as it were, in life s drama, from which we ought to escape when it grows wearisome, and certainly, when we have had our fill    
 gt   
 gt  such, my friends, are my views on old age      may you both attain it, and thus be able to prove by experience the truth of what you have heard from me      "

now to give you a little background of the question the crosses my mind  i am a m24, graduated just before the covid19 halted the world  not a good time to be a graduate as jobs are getting scarce as ever and people were in fact losing jobs  however i got a job but with only 169usd per month, it doesn t even take me off the ground to where i wanted to go, which to pursue my passion project once i have enough money  at 24, living with parents with below minimum wage, even way below the poverty line of my country is stressing  no matter what people say, i still feel that i need to have more control and responsibility over my life, hence the urge to leave the house and live on my own is always there  but the situation with money restricts me  

that s about money mainly now we move on to the job that gives me money  

as a research assistant cum admin assistant at a local university, the centre has to follow the recruitment flows which states that i will work here as a part timer first  this comes without the confirmation of being permanent  i thought it was okay at first where i had the chance to prove myself  but as months went by, i feel that none of the things they do really matter to me  i started to lose focus and interest and getting off bed every morning only makes me dread it  my mind is now focused solely onto pursuing the passion project  

onto the passion project    

since covid19 happened we all spent more time with our phones more than ever  it was during this time i started to fall in love with making videos for youtube  now in my mind i have it all layout for an educational informative talking head style channel where my niche audience will be from my country mainly  now i m slowly setting up a recording corner in my bedroom where i can do the recordings  i will go on with this despite the occasional anxiety attack  however if i choose this as a career which i want, it will be unorthodox and indifference to the people i love especially my family  as conservative parents, they want me to work as a public servant getting pension when i m old  i don t think that s what i want and all this dilemma really starting me to ask the big question  

i feel as if things are not enough and i don t have much time to get a happy, fulfilling life  so i ask you my fellow stoics, how do the great stoics look at this and is there a way to get things realigned in your life when things not yet go your way

  epictetus

i've never liked watching sports, and even less about conversations about it  i don't judge people who are enthusiastic about sports, but even they struggle to have a meaningful discussion about it   because   having a meaningful discussion in any subject is a rare thing    why?

i'm looking to improve my understanding about good discussions and bounce my own ideas about them  i'd love for you to share your input   for that has the real potential of making the life of mine and others more wonderful 

   

 gt  you could leave life right now  let that determine what you do and say and think    
  marcus aurelius

in stoicism, we bring the thing that is most farthests from us to the very center  remembering death shines light on life  i'd like to propose, that maybe the analogue is true in conversation 

my reading of epictetus' quote is that we shouldn't talk about things we know, but rather, what we don't know    instead of staying inside the limits of our knowledge, we should continually strive to keep our ignorance at the center    in practice, this means asking ourselves

  ""why do i want to say this?""
  ""why is this relevant to me?""
  ""how can i go deeper into what makes this meaningful to me?""

as listeners, we should facilitate a state like this in the speaker  we should stay mostly silent, yes, but i feel   we      must      speak when we are bored  , for then the speaker has usually lost their ignorance and is ruminating 

additionally, in those kind of discussion where the speaker is examining their own experience or persona,   we should interrupt if we feel they missed a significant piece of ignorance    i see it as if they're walking past a path that has sign that says ""this leads to   obscured  , and it's probably more relevant than you'll get on your current path "" for example, if someone is thinking about their relationship and says ""   and then they laughed, as if i'm a child, and i got so angry and said   "" we should interrupt  ""i'm sorry, but why did you get angry? is it not okay for you to behave like a child?"" in my experience, interruptions like these bring forth some new part of the person, which they might have not been aware of, thus increasing knowledge for both parties  therefore   

  the aim of a discussion should be to increase knowledge about oneself or the world    there are obvious exceptions, but what other worth can a discussion have? we can of course feel connected to a person even while talking about sports or food or how that one time we ate food while watching sports  this can increase warmth and strengthen the relationship and is usually seen as the (unconscious) motive of this kind of talk  but wouldn't a more meaningful discussion, one which leads to new personal discoveries, nourish the connection so much better?

but nourished we are not  people are ill equipped for discussions like these, for it truly is a high mountain i want to climb  but discussing is a skill and skills can be learned and some can even be taught 

i regularly find myself amidst people who won't engage in a discussion  it's a bleak place  i have a habit of testing how i could facilitate a meaningful discussion, but i'll be honest here  the reluctance of most people to dive deep is making me depressed and sad  (not like  depressed , but you know what i mean )

and i know that one of the old farts says

""that is the answer to give to people whom death would actually come as a release  'you are scared of dying? so you are alive, then, as you are?' """
1,"reminder to stoics to keep feeling and stay human (for simplicity, i use 'feeling' to describe sensations that can be reasoned with and controlled, and 'emotions' to describe those that can't be )

it seems like some stoics, bending the stick hard to one day be straight again, cut off all feeling in an attempt to control them, or for fear of their becoming emotions  but going to one extreme to ward off another, and the popular understanding of stoicism as being something like this, is unstoic  

 gt this is the first promise that philosophy holds out to us  fellow feeling, humanity, sociability  (seneca,  epistles , 5 4 )  
 gt   
 gt i should not be unfeeling like a statue  i should care for my relationship both natural and acquired   as a pious man, a son, a brother, a father, a citizen  (epictetus,  discourses , 3 2 4 )

respecting feelings, stoicism asks at least two things  that, one, whatever feelings you have should be genuinely yours 

 gt now, am i urging you to be hard hearted, do i ask that you don't betray   feelings   at the funeral, do i refuse to let your spirit even be touched? not at all  it would be barbarous, not courageous, to watch the burial rites of one's own   with the same eyes that watched them while living   and not be moved as one's family is torn apart  suppose i did forbid it  some things have rights of their own  tears fall even from those trying to hold them back  being shed, they lift the spirit  what, then, shall we do? let us allow them to fall, but not order them to do so  let there be as much weeping as   feelings   may produce, not as much as imitation may demand  let us add nothing to grief, not enlarge it to match the example of someone else  (seneca,  epistles , 99 15 16 )

and, two, that you shouldn't let your feelings become emotions and cloud or do away with your ability to reason 

 gt a man thinks himself injured, wants to be revenged, and then   being dissuaded for some reason   he quickly calms down again  i don't call this anger, but a mental impulse yielding to reason  anger   or any other emotion   is that which overleaps reason and carries it away  (seneca,  on anger , 4 )

as with everything, stoicism asks for temperance and equanimity  that doesn't mean not feeling and not expressing your feelings (though you should serve the greater good by recognizing how your expressions affect people and that they might not be beneficial everywhere)  you're human in a world filled with humans and should be conscious of the human need for feeling  but if you cry or yell, do it because, at no great cost to you or anyone, feeling catharsis or relief from it would make you feel better, and it would be better to not let bad feelings build up until they become a bad emotion  laugh similarly, but know the cause of your laughter and a reason for making it, and be conscientious 

 gt we should bring ourselves to see all the vices of the crowd not as hateful but as ridiculous  and we should imitate democritus rather than heraclitus  for the latter, every time he went out into public, used to weep  the former used to laugh  one saw everything we do as wretchedness, the other as absurdity  things should be made light of, and taken more easily  it is more civilized to laugh at life than to bewail it  (seneca,  on the tranquility of mind , 15 2 )  
 gt   
 gt it is better to accept common behavior and human vices calmly, without bursting into either laughter or tears  for to be hurt by the sufferings of others is to be forever miserable, while to enjoy the sufferings of others is an inhuman pleasure  (15 5 )

consider your good and bad feelings from different angles and consider their affects on you and the world, and judge whether their expression is virtuous, whether they serve the greater good  while all feelings should be had, not all expressions should be expressed  while the former should be controlled and reasoned with, the latter should be deliberate and useful "
1,"a great resource for learning about stoicism is r stoicism  here are some ways that i use r stoicism to learn about stoicism and to learn how to apply stoic principles to my daily life  

1  i look at new posts and replies  i read many, and i spend time journaling, and sometimes researching other resources, about the topics of quite a few  

2  i have posted a few times and i've replied a few more times  

3  i use the  faq ( a lot  it's a great resource  the word search function has been very helpful  even when i'm reading something other than r stoicism i will sometimes refer to the faq  there is a lot of information there  

4  the search function for r stoicism is awesome  there are many years of posts and replies on this sub  often these old replies will give information that is not a part of the current replies being offered for a particular post  ""how would a stoic handle fomo?"" was a recent post that has been asked and answered many times, for example  and i often find links to old articles from stoic writers who are still writing and teaching about stoicism today  if you do not find any day's posts that suit your fancy, try searching for a word or phrase that you are interested in and see what others have said about it in the past  

5  i like knowing that others have chosen a similar path to living the good life "

disclaimer  i take full responsibility over my actions  i should have assumed that my sneezing and congested nose wasn t normal and a sign of something worse  i should have assumed worse case scenario and hunkered down until i knew what it was  i assumed it was nothing and now that false assumption brings me here  

i don t know if i have covid or not i ll have to wait till tomorrow to go and get checked out and then i d have to wait 3 5 days to get the result  i am fearing for the future but i know i shouldn t since the stoics wouldn t see it as a good use of time  but i m struggling with the fact that i may have inadvertently hurt loved ones  how can i just move past that? how can i be stoic in the face of my atrocious behavior? 

disclaimer 2  i live with my mom who doesn t really care about the virus but i work at a grocery store (i m 18) and i have no clue on whether it was me or her or her friend (who lives with us) that brought it (potentially cause we don t know if it covid)  but i still take responsibility because it s the right thing to do  also no way in hell my mom is going to take responsibility  but that s a story for another day

1,"stoicism and creativity i have been thinking about this a lot lately  in the past, i have struggled with motivation to do art thinking that if there is not a way for people to see it, why is it worth the time? i know this is not a stoic mindset, as stoicism calls you to be in tune with yourself and not seek praise, but on the other hand what my mind keeps going back to is whether art at its center is about expressing yourself to the world and connecting with others  idk if this makes sense, but generally does anyone have any thoughts about how stoicism works into creativity and motivation to create art?"

1,"why should i choose stoicism over nihilism? first off, i would say that i consider myself a stoic but i've been very nihilistic in the past  it seems to me that you can't really have stoicism without a little bit of nihilism  when stoics acknowledge how clear it is that not much matters in the bigger scale of things and that we're all going to die, this sounds almost exactly a nihilist would say  

for me though, nihilism makes me depressed and stoicism makes me kind of bored and feel like i'm almost living pointlessly, as i'm just going on through life and trying to avoid suffering whilst not being able to get much real long term joy either  i just go to school, which bores me, and stay at home on an afternoon to nighttime and then go to sleep  i don't have a girlfriend or much that i need to commit to  i have some friends but i see enough of them at school throughout the weekdays that i don't feel like i really need to talk to them much outside of school  for me, my life seems to revolve around being bored and thinking about stoicism or trying to get short term pleasure from things that can just become addictive and in the end possibly cause more suffering to me than joy 

nothing really goes extremely great for me and i just shrug it off, not feeling any happier, just slightly annoyed  i also have ocd which makes following stoic principles harder for me  considering all of this, i don't really think stoicism has added much meaning to my life, it has just made me more depressed "

1,"i gave into lust and visited prostitutes  what should i do now? tldr  i visited independent prostitutes 3 times  i felt empty afterwards each time, so i quit it  although now i don't think of sex as something foreign, but i paid for it and that feels fucked up  i never thought i'll go down this road, and now i cannot go back and change it 

i've never had sex before, and i was just getting tired of not finding anyone or waiting for arranged marriage 

so i paid for it and did it, more than once  i just didn't feel anything the first time, so i thought it's because i was nervous  but i felt equally empty the next time, and the next time 

so i stopped  now i regret it  i know that i cannot do anything about the past now, but i can do right in the present  

but still i can't help but regret my choices  although the experience has opened my eyes, now i don't keep sex on a pedestal like i used to  and hence, i feel i've become less desparate about finding a girlfriend or getting married "
1,"infidelity, rumors, lies, and stoicism i must admit before i found the stoic path i was far from virtuous  it was a lifestyle i was not raised to be part of, my parents raised me baptist and say what you will about christianity  but i was very well aware of right from wrong   i could blame this on my  friends  but it wasn t their fault, we all have a choice and well i chose the path i was on  for years i blamed others for my issues, it s my bosses fault, my parents, my sister, my friends, etc  when in reality it was mine  i have recently been studying stoicism heavy and not just the modern take on it but the whole of it, it s origins, the logic (which i found out is basically the same logic we use today), ethics, and physics  in doing this i ve gotten a deep understanding of what stoicism is and how to go about it, more so than holiday or kirby or robertson could teach me in a book  i have a notebook filled with notes and scribbles  
          recently i found out a friend has been lied to, he was told that i was spreading false accusations about him  now the me i was 3 years ago would have done this sure, but i haven t said anything about him since we have met a year ago  he came up to me and was immediately angry and accused me of the crime, when i tried to tell him i was not guilty of his accusation he became furious and called me a  clown   now 3 years ago i would have cussed him and told him what an idiot he was, which would have led to a much bigger argument or a fist fight  this time i simply said that it wasn t true and moved on, two days later he came up to me and apologized  i felt comfort in knowing that not allowing my initial emotional reaction to be the one i used in the situation helped to mend the problem  the  harm  others inflict or try to inflict on us is not of our concern it s theirs 
         this brings me to my second situation, i found some messages from my wife to her  friend  and from her  friend  to her that indicate a rather  friendly  relationship that i myself was unaware of  now i used to be a jealous man, i would threaten to gouge our eyes and rip our throats (all idle threats of course)  now it s been some time since i was like this(highschool)  now i know i can not control her infidelity, and i do still love her with all the passion that i felt when we first met  my point i am making with this second bit is that i don t feel the pain would feel with this revelation and i know that it isn t due to a lack of love  i feel almost relieved that i was right which i know i shouldn t  i m not really looking for stoic advice so much as maybe some people to talk to about stoicism with  ( she despises stoicism) i appreciate everyone who reads this long ass post and i would love to hear some opinions on my situations "

1,"stoicism for a better life   weekly exercise (september 30) hello there, 

for this week s exercise, i will look for inspiration from the moral letters of seneca to lucillius cviii 27 27 

 gt ""let us therefore set out whole heartedly, leaving aside out many distractions and exert ourselves in this single purpose, before we realize too late the swift and unstoppable flight of time and are left behind  as each day arises, welcome it as the very best day of all, and make it your own possession  we must seize what flees """"  

pretty deep stuff for a letter between friends  but then again, this is why the moral letters of seneca are so popular  they summarize a lot of the best points from his great body of work (which i highly recommend to any  prokopton  looking for  prokop     or in english, anyone who is studying stoicism to improve themselves )

although scientifically and mathematically we have proven spacetime to be a fabric and exist in its entirety already (yes   your future is already in the past of someone that exists today or existed before you), from our perspective space remains ""spatial"" and time marches on in one direction  this relentless march goes on until our perspective ceases to exist (i e  we die)  this perception of time is an illusion of our consciousness, but all this fancy science does not change the simple fact that, as far as we can tell, we grow old and then we die  and there is nothing we can do to change that (yet) 

time is our most precious resource, so don't waste it  make the most of it  and making the most of it does not mean eat the most whatever you love, and do the most whatever is fun  make the most of it means this  what will make you happy and truly proud when you're on your deathbed looking back at your life? whatever that is, do more of that  much more of it  

  so as a practical exercise this week, try a eulogy exercise    if you are unfamiliar with this, basically you imagine your future funeral and write your own eulogy  or, you can try and imagine being on your own death bed (as aforementioned) and list out the things that your future dying self would be proud of, or would wish to have done more of  whatever exercise you do and however you   identify what is truly important to you, do more of that   

if you feel like it, share what you identified  this may help inspire others as well

with a resolute heart and cheerful?
or hide your face from the light of day

oh, a trouble's a ton, or a trouble's an ounce,
or a trouble is what you make it,
and it isn't the fact that you're hurt that counts,
but only how did you take it?

you are beaten to earth? well, well, what's that?
come up with a smiling face 
it's nothing against you to fall down flat,
but to lie there    that's disgrace 
the harder you're thrown, why the higher you bounce 
be proud of your blackened eye!
it isn't the fact that you're licked that counts,
it's how did you fight     and why?

and though you be done to the death, what then?
if you battled the best you could,
if you played your part in the world of men,
why, the critic will call it good 
death comes with a crawl, or comes with a pounce,
and whether he's slow or spry,
it isn't the fact that you're dead that counts,

1,"stoic approach to a friend refusing to pay me? i am sharing a house with friends for the university year  before we moved in we agreed on how the bills were to be split  however, when it came the day to pay one friend decided to minus  40 from the amount he owed me as he ""no longer felt like paying me that much""  

how do i approach this situation? from reading meditations i believe i'm supposed to let it go and hold no grudge for it  however i feel this borders the line between being a pushover and being stoic 

i would feel differently if he simply owed me money and took a while to pay it but the blatant refusal on no logical grounds is disrespectful  the fact that he can't keep his word on an agreement involving money struck amongst friends  especially considering we have been friends for years  i also know he is not wanting for money, he is the most privileged and well off by far of the household 

the complicated part in all this is i still have to live with this person for a year and my initial reaction is i no longer want anything to do with him 

any guidance or input would be appreciated  thank you "
1,"a question on marcus aurelius' writing a few weeks ago, these thoughts came to me, like it's hard to work with each other and that i would not want to stay in society any longer  in most institutions and organizations, there's probably someone controlling how things work in a corrupt way  i feel like we live in a system where the government is constantly exploiting us, where honest hard work won't be enough, where where there is authority and power, the possibility of someone taking that all for himself will always exist and i do not want to be a part of it  

now, i have been mildly practicing stoicism since january 2020 after stumbling upon marcus aurelius' work, meditations, 3 years ago randomly at a bookstore and i have a question,

  how would one deal with these thoughts?  

because as i have observed, most of marcus aurelius' writings are about nature and cosmos and how we must work together because we are 'made' for working together 

  i always try to center my thoughts around stoicism (but i also incorporate other philosophies that work for me),"

i've become aware of this small weight i'm carrying with me  not so heavy, but long, as if penetrating back in time  but is this burden but a part of me? for i've been a restless soul, a temperate one, not in the sense of moderation, but in the sense of heat and haste  more than my behaviour, i've found this in the contents of my mind and speech 

have i been a person of principle and virtue? sometimes  do i know what is right and still give into what is easy and pleasurable? but then again, where goes the line  is excess anything but bread, olives and water, with maybe a piece of cheese every now and then? i'm okay adding chocolate to the list, but cheese puffs are hard to justify, and yet (again) i'm salivating 

 gt         you have received the philosophical theorems, with which you ought to be familiar, and you have been familiar with them  what other master, then, do you wait for, to throw upon that the delay of reforming yourself?        

not buying cheese puffs is easy but being a person abstaining from what is familiar, feels new  being more mindful of what i say is easy, but how tiresome (more now than before) it is to be amidst people who babble  so, it's not that doing the right thing  is hard, but leaving old parts of me behind, is 

for me and for now, stoicism is a name for a process of growth  and with inner growth, it is like it is with children  i'm a parent and i don't know what my child will grow into  and no better do i know what this process of mine turns me into  there is no peeking into the future  but i know that getting there means that i'll be leaving big parts of ""the old me"" behind  it is an exchange where i give things that i know for things that are unknown  this is what i mean by yielding  and what excuse i have not to yield fully, not to urge myself forward towards the unknown?

a big part of that research however actually consists of the opinion or thought experiments of others  even the works of the ancient sto cs are in a way well thought out opinions with a theme  marcus aurelius was a scholar and a teacher, but he learned from his teachers, and they from their teachers and so on  he used that input to form his own opinions on things  i find it hard to believe he disregarded what others said because he perceived them as less intelligent or simply disagreed with them  

so apart from the social value of caring about what others think of you  aren't our thoughts a synthesis of all the opinions around us? maybe even moreso in a time where 'factual' knowledge was less available  when is your opinions yours?

i think if 10 people were to look at the same little piece of information, they all process it differently and take different lessons from it based on who we are (eduction, background, age, gender etc )  why shouldn't i value the opinions of those other 9 over my own? 

now maybe i read to much into it and is this quote more about 'focus on what you can control'  

curious what you guys think about this "
1,"opinions you have no authority over the opinions others hold  we all have our opinions  it is just how we personally perceive things  but opinions are not just some random thing  they are simply the view which one takes  and what may affect how they see these things? simply how they were brought up and the environment they live in  so to each person, if you can, see who they are exactly   how does he commonly respond approach certain things? what environment did she come from? to what kind of people are they surrounded by?  the point of this is so you can understand why they might have such opinions  how can you blame these people then? the opinion holder is just ignorant, and therefore is not necessarily targeting you but rather acting in their ignorance  do not, though, immediately assume one s own opinion or view to be false though  before you strip the person naked and see who they really are, you should apply their remark to reason  that is to rationalise with that which they said  calculate how accurate or likely it is, or how logical it sounds  somebody tells you that sugar is an utter evil food that one must at all costs avoid  now reason with this  and if you do this properly you should  be able to respond in your own mind   but in what point of time did someone experience terrible illness or death from a little sugar? and what about a balanced diet? what is wrong with it? sure, too much of sugar is bad, but sugar itself is nothing to discriminate about 

so, now you must respond to one s opinion thus correcting their inaccuracy  no, not at all  in fact, why do you need to?  you certainly have the right to share your opinion to this person if you shall, only be aware that he or she might have an opinion about your response! so you must foresee this and accept it  remembering that this is but an opinion  the aim is not to convince someone otherwise, for you yourself cannot alter their perspectives without their cooperation  and if this person wills debate, it is neither wise to respond to their statements with a statement of your own, nor will it make any difference to how they see things  because they have no interest to consider your words  their only interest is to express their thoughts and beliefs  and further to ignore or find fault with what belief anyone else shares  therefore, unless someone accepts the opinions of others, moreover is open to take it into consideration, then he or she may completely despise your words and make debate  and if you know that this person has such a routine then, why do you see it plausible to bother? but in the opposite course, the person may consider your say and think,  yes, that sounds rather accurate and so i now see the thing differently   but it was not you that altered their perception  it was they who decided to listen and to consider your response, and furthermore to adapt it for themselves "
1,"tips on how to avoid getting affected by thinking about negative scenarios hello, fellow stoics, and stoics in training  i needed help with a particular trait of mine that makes life hell for me at times   
  
i am the kind of person who thinks a lot about different scenarios that might arise out of a particular situation, and how i can deal with them as and when they arise  this trait helps me, because it allows me to have a solution ready for different situations   
  
however, it has also made life tough for me at times because i imagine certain scenarios that are quite scary, and once i imagine those scenarios, they take hold of my mind, and i become really tense (so much so that i am unable to think of solutions to such scenarios)  that impacts my mental well being too, sometimes   
  
are there any ways in stoicism that can allow me to continue anticipating different situations, but not get so affected by the scary ones? this trait of mine can be looked at in two ways, from previous posts on this subreddit  here ( and  here ( how do i strike a balance between the two? how do i anticipate things, yet not allow the truly bad ones to affect me, psychologically?  
  
thank you in advance, hope you have a lovely day and week ahead "
1,"worrying about things outside your control will just waste mental energy and thought that could otherwise be directed toward your goal of being more virtuous in ways that are within your control this occurred to me today and although it seems obvious now, it wasn't before and it helped me shift my perspective in a way that has helped me break through some mental barriers  

you see, before this thought i had tried to not worry about things outside my control just simply for the reason that they are outside my control and therefore it is pointless to worry about them  this certainly helped and worked in a variety of situations, but it mostly just appeals to my logic and proved to be less effective in persuading my emotional self on the stickier situations  for example, i still found myself worrying about other people i knew who were more successful than me  i would repeat to myself ""fame and success depend on many factors outside our control,"" and every 10th repetition or so of that mantra it would make me feel a bit better for a while, but my subconscious would keep circling back to it again later 

but, then i had the thought written in the title  this is different from not worrying about things simply because they are not within our control  that leaves open ended the question of  well what to do then with my mental energy?  remembering in that same moment that my ever present goal is to be as virtuous as possible helps me to fill the hole otherwise left behind by removing those worries with efforts to be better myself and pursue my goals in ways that are within my control  i can't just tell my mind ""don't worry""  i have to give myself a purpose too  something else to think about and focus my attention on  something to positively act on 

i had already also been telling myself to have the goal of being virtuous, from stoic readings  but somehow i hadn't properly connected the two  now they come as one thought  don't worry about things outside of my control  and instead  focus my attention and efforts on things that are within my control, to further my goal of being as virtuous as possible  i'll have to see if this stands the test of time or has just been a temporary false epiphany  but, for the last couple days this slight revision of thought has yielded much better results, particularly for my more challenging mental situations 

that all said, i'm totally open to criticisms and suggestions if others think there is a flaw in my perspective, or a way that it could be further improved  you won't rain on my parade "
1,"need advice on economic future how do you deal with not overthinking about the country's economic future  i just watched the presidential debates  it was comical  but honestly, it was also concerning  because all of this has interrelated effects that trickle down into society 

as a citizen who wants to be informed to some extent (but not too informed because watching the news these days can push people into deep depression), i am really saddened and concerned about the country's economic future  this affects us all at the end of the day   i e  affect's one's ability to get a job to put food on the table if we continue into a great depression  poor leadership from both parties and liberals overreacting and wanting to shut down the world for the flu (covid) is slowly revealing its effects  look at nyc and its wave of bankruptcies and trash piling up on the street  etc  etc

 matt, do you ever think about infinity?  i ask my roommate who s lazing on the red sofa, sipping his ritualistic morning coffee and scrolling on his phone  

 in what regard?  he replies, only half paying attention  i spin my armchair around to face him  green and blue light from his instagram feed flash in his glasses 

 well, sometimes it s like i can feel myself expanding with the universe, and there s this rush of energy that threatens to rip me apart,  i clarify, fishing for eye contact  he furrows his brows, sets his phone down, and meets my gaze 

 i usually think of god in regards to the infinite  can t say i ve thought about it like you, dj  it makes my head hurt just hearing about it,  he says  he slides his glasses up his nose and takes another sip 

 headaches tend to happen when you start thinking or talking about infinity long enough,  i admit with a small chuckle 

 maybe it s a sign,  he warns with a side eyed smirk 

 of what?  i ask with curiosity 

 that we, as finite, mortal beings, shouldn t be exploring this stuff,  he says 

 a sign from who? or what?  i ask, inching a bit forward 

 god probably  maybe it hurts because we re on a track we shouldn t be on, like walking towards the tree with the forbidden fruit,  he says, gesturing with his hand 

 so what?  i prod 

 we should stop before god or something else arrives and brings divine punishment on our sorry asses, like the fall of adam and eve,  he says with finality  i let this sink in for a moment  he picks up his phone and starts scrolling again 

 god is supposed to be everywhere, all knowing, and all powerful, right?  i ask 

 sure,  he shrugs 

 alright, so, how does he do it? what is his method?  i ponder  he sighs in frustration and sets his phone down 

 it s god we re talking about here, he works in mysterious ways  perhaps it s supposed to  remain  mysterious for us humans,  he says 

 what if every single atom, every tiny particle, was like a tiny eye of god, and that s how he does it?  i ask  he laughs 

 i think you re thinking too hard  what would you do about it even if that were the case? what  could  you do about it?  he poses 

 well   i don t know  but it would be like the ultimate spy network bro, no one could escape from his sight no matter where they went, because  everything  would be made up of his eyes, even our bodies! which would mean, in a sense, we are  

 dude, my head hurts, i m done,  he interrupts, returning to his phone and coffee  damn, just when it was getting good, too  i sigh out my sadness   i spin my armchair around, returning to epictetus    discourses   on my computer 

 you, on the other hand,  are  a creature placed in charge, and a particle of god himself  there is a bit of god within you,  i read to myself  well, by that logic, we as humans would have a divine, infinite nature within, making god a greater infinity than us  would it be possible for me to ascend beyond god, by becoming an even greater infinity than him?

what would that be like? a wave of guilt washes over me, like i was just caught with my hand in the cookie jar  it feels heavy  i cross my arms and sulk a bit 

 wait, what do i even have to feel guilty about?  i say to myself, shaking it off  i sit up, returning my attention to my computer  someone taps me on the shoulder   what?  i ask, turning around to see   no one?

 i didn t say anything,  my roommate says  ya, and he didn t move from the couch either  and shelly isn t home  a cold shiver runs down my spine as i turn to my research once again 

something slithers like worms on wet noodles behind me  fear freezes my whole body  my eyes grow wide  my breath shortens 

something   something is slithering on my shoulders! guilt, depression, and existential dread sink deep into me  it s like when i dream of horrific monsters  the fear paralyzes me in its grip  i m too scared to even breathe 

every fiber in my being tells me not to turn around, to pretend that i feel nothing  i can t do that  i have to look  i must know 

my hands grow cold and clammy  sweat beads on my forehead  me breath quickens as i swivel my armchair around  my jaw drops in awe 

a giant, wretched eye has opened on the wall, red veins bleeding from its canthi into the ceiling and floor like jagged branches and roots  its pupil is a portal, a doorway into the infinite expanse beyond our three dimensions  out of this portal writhes innumerable tendrils with black slime that patters on the ceiling like rain, seeping death s stench into the room  i can feel its sentience  it knows i m here 

 bro   bro, do you see this?  i whisper, noting the tendrils as they slither over my body 

 see what?  he asks, glued to his phone  how can he not see this? we re facing in the same goddamned direction!

 matt   i whisper, tears welling in my eyes  its tendrils slither under my shirt and bore into my stomach  i can feel it writhing under my skin, sucking everything out  oh god, he was right!

 what do you think you actually are?  the question burns into my mind with a trillion voices saying it all at once  i can feel it now   i m dissolving into everything, becoming one with the universe  i am not my body, my ego, or my emotions i   i 

 i am that i am,  i realize  my words echo and reverberate through the air, cracking reality like fine crystal  my heart ignites with courage that explodes forth as divine, prismatic light  in an instant holy fire burns the wretched tendrils into glowing embers  daemonic shrieking pierces the air as the eye writhes in pain 

hot air rushes about the room as massive heat waves escape my body  my clothes evaporate  i levitate off the chair as electricity burns my injuries away, leaving healthy tissue in the flames  wake  

looking at my hand is like looking into the depths of the sun, except that the light doesn t hurt my eyes  i can see beyond the surface, where infinite fractals endlessly loop over and over each other  i can see with every part of my being  like the phoenix, i am reborn 

this heat, this power   i ve never felt so alive! so euphoric  so complete     

 not even god has the power of coercion over us,  i quote  i turn my gaze to the eye, and watch as my power withers it away like a slug buried in salt and set ablaze, until nothing but ashes remain  

 matt,  i say, my voice echoing  i turn to him  he s slumped on cinders  half of him is scorched, the other half drenched in blood  his coffee is nowhere to be found 

i have finally reached enlightenment  yet, at the same time, my infinite nature has burned my friend to death  i am simultaneously hero and monster, good and evil  truly, with infinity all things are possible 

walking on tongues of prismatic flame, i make my way over to my friend  life has escaped what s left of his eyes  he s gone dark  no one s home  curious to see what happens, i place a scintillating hand on his head and command with all that i am,

1,"how do i deal with constant thoughts of my unrequited love? i've discovered stoicism a while back and i felt it all sat so well with me, and i've used this philosophy to soothe my mind many times and regarding many topics before, however, i can't seem to be able to implement it when it comes to romance 

in short, i'm in this some sort of fwb situation with a man i love very deeply, not only in a romantic way, but in every way, which is why i'm wanting to stay in contact with him  we've been in each others lives on and off for nearly 2 years now, and it's clear he sees me only as a friend, which logically, is completely fine by me, however, emotionally it's been very painful  the outcome i'm wishing upon this situation is for myself to either ""fall out of love"" and continue our friendship as a friendship like any other, or be able to remove the weight off of the emotion i feel towards him, i mean, keep loving him the way i do if i have no choice, but be indifferent to the emotion  this would've been easy to deal with  if my mind wasn't so occupied with him 

i will deal with the emotional pain, that's not an issue  what i do need help with is, how do i stop thinking of him? us? it feels like over time i had forgotten how to think of and about anything else, it's a little embarassing to admit, but he's honestly on my mind around 90  of the time  what i'm really asking for is perhaps if anyone has any ideas for specific books or articles or anything stoic related, even some sort of ""brain exercises"", or just advice?

 what would be the wise approach here that would lead to you getting the respect you deserve, and get rid of the bothersome dude?"
1,"passed my first test of will since starting my journey down the stoic path i'm sharing this story because i'm proud of myself and wanted to share some of my personal growth without telling the people close to me of what occurred  i started my journey down the stoic path only about a month ago when i bought few books about the subject after really struggling with guilt of how i have behaved in the passed, the quarantine had just given me too much time to think  in the passed i've made bad decisions specifically related to instant gratification an pleasure without concern for the pain it caused others and myself  

i'm referring to being unfaithful in a previous relationship, at the time i did all kinds of mental gymnastics to justify it and when the relationship ended for other reasons i still hung on to that guilt but continued to behave poorly  this went on for a while until i met the woman who is now my wife and i decided she was worth growing up over, i was 23 when i met her and we dated for two years before i asked her to marry me  the relationship has been great, she's been everything i've ever asked for, i have never been unfaithful towards her and we got married in december right before the quarantine started  

i always considered myself emotionally weak and thought i'd fall back in to the same bad habits i had before i met her so what i would do is simply avoid the possibility of temptation  i avoided going out without her, drinking, and would avoid being alone with women when in a social setting  i know this all sounds a bit extreme but that's how little i thought of myself, it's not that i though i would charm any women i was alone with it's that i thought i might try and that's enough to ruin relationships  

anyways last week i left town to accompany my father to his home town to spend time with my grandfather  the test came when my cousin invited me out to hang out with some of his friends, he's a doctor who said it was safe and we where in a small town so i figured covid wasn't an issue  my grandparents already contracted the disease and survived it with relative ease so i wasn't worried about infecting them, they have the antibodies  we went out to a lagoon where we met up with a few guys and several girls, i was wearing my wedding ring so i thought that would immediately make cheating not an option since it would be extremely obvious i'm married, however two girls didn't seem to care very much about this  my cousin took one of them to ""use the bathroom"" in his car but they didn't come back for and hour so i was left pretty much alone with the other one when everyone else went in the water or separated off in to their own conversations 

what i would normally do in this situation is find an excuse to get out of it or torpedo my own chances  however the wedding ring didn't work and my cousin took the car, then i remembered something i read  i'm sorry if i butcher this but in ""the beginners guide to stoicism"" i read about how one has control of their own desires  how i should desire only what i can always have and desire to avoid what i can always avoid  i always have control of my actions, this 100lbs girl in front of me had no control over my will or desires  i desired to avoid being unvirtuous and unfaithful and no matter how much someone tempts me i can't truly be tempted if i just don't desire to have sex with them  once that clicked in my head it was actually pretty easy, i actually had a pretty enjoyable conversation with her and after a while she opened up about her own issues and why she was being so forward  i truly didn't desire her physically because now i viewed her as a young girl with a poor decision making process  

the conversation shifted towards me giving her a few tips to help her out, i even recommended a couple books to her  i recommended the previously referenced ""beginners guide to stoicism"" by matthew van natta and ""the daily stoic"" by ryan holiday and stephen hanselman  i'm not very far in to my journey so i really just regurgitated what i had read but i'm amazed i was able to apply what i had read so quickly and effectively  i'm excited to see how else i can apply what i'm learning and continue to grow since i still have a long way to go but just knowing i had the strength to view the situation clearly and shift my mindset is a huge moral booster "

1,"how does one strive to do better every day yet not be bogged down by the feeling of being unsatisfied? i was reading ""mindfulness in plain english"" and came across this passage in the first few pages 

 gt  just because of the simple fact that you are human, you find yourself heir to an inherent unsatisfactoriness in life that simply will not go away  you can suppress it from your awareness for a time  you can distract yourself for hours on end, but it always comes back, and usually when you least expect it 

in retrospect, this is so obvious, but i had to stop reading the book and reflect on it because i realized that the feeling of being unsatisfied has been the cause of most stress in the past few months in my life 

i tried to look at it from a stoic lens  what i see is that i should not think about what i cant control, but focus on what i can  

but i find that the two are paradoxical and am looking to make sense out of it  

i want to do the best that i can in life, which would also mean that i shoould rigorously pursue and work hard on things that i can control  however, pursuing it, does leave a feeling of being unsatisfied always 

what do the stoics say about this, if anything?"
1,"yesterday it hit me, the clock of time is ticking, but the end is nowhere in sight  yesterday was a pretty timid day, nothing out of the ordinary  i was sitting in class, our schools guidance counselor came in at the end of the lesson to talk about future careers and the choices we have after high school  i was sitting at the back of class, not really paying any attention  just thinking  then i hear her say  as you only have roughly half a year left in high school, you need to choose your path  university applications will be sent in early march   

then it hit me, all the goals i have, the things i ve dreamt about and what i ve wanted to achieve  it s not far away, while time was passing on an everyday basis i was worrying about non essential things, people s thoughts about me, social anxiety, what i was going to do after the lesson etc  all of those thoughts, they don t matter, the things that plague me don t matter  in 3 months i will have forgotten about them anyway  

the list of goals i have, my dreams, ambitions and everything i want to do  it s all after high school, something i imagined doing in my 20s  the worries of today don t matter, who cares what other think of you, who cares about rumors going around about you, who cares about being rejected by a girl 1 year back and still have it infecting your mind like an ever growing cancer  none of it matters, in 2 years i will have forgotten about it  the only thing i need to make right is that i learn from the mistakes i and others made  so i may evolve more as a person

when some other guy walks along the beach in x (insert arbitrary number here) years, the sand used to build the castle will be as good as any other sand  nobody will be able to tell that this sand was once used for a castle  nobody will even know that the castle once existed 

now, this doesn't mean that you shouldn't build a castle  if your nature as a human being is to build a castle, then you should do so  

but if you do it for fame, you are not being rational, because eventually your once famous sand will be as good as any other sand

1,"virtue in stoic ethics  where is the line in ""virtue"" supposed to be drawn? can't it be argued that any action you do to benefit yourself is unvirtuous in nature as it steps on other people? does this not result in the stoic getting the shorter end of the stick at all times?

1,"i'm tired of myself i'm 20(m) and i'm a law student  long story short i am having huge anxiety problems  i always feel like i don't belong at my college  i'm always very hard on myself  usually, i used to grab every opportunity which is in my hand but now since i got into stoicism, i haven't been really using every opportunity and labelling it as betterment for my mental health i have become lazier  there's a moot competition culture in law schools where you'd represent the college competing with other colleges in dealing with cases  my whole self worth was put into that i know it's not the right thing to do but my college culture has this atmosphere that if you're good with moots you would be a good lawyer  i want to succeed something in my life  all my life i have been an imposter trying to fit in every place i go to  my dad is not proud or happy of me taking law since he has his own selfish reasons that i'd get separated from him  also, he wants me to look after his business which i clearly don't want to  it feels like it's been a mistake that i took law since i don't feel like i belong there, my parents aren't really proud, i don't even have the required skills  all my mates are so talented and great that it cripples the fuck outta my anxiety  
idk what's the state here, my close friend sees me as a competition and it sucks  it has drained our relationship  we together planned to start a law journal together but he did it with someone else and it hurts like hell for me  idk i feel neglected and bad  i make up my mind that it's all his ego for competing with me but deep down i know for a fact that it's his life his choices who am i to say him to start the journal with me 

today another best friend of mine wants to do moot with another team and this seems okay and normal but i'm fully hurt since we actually planned to do it together  now he left me  i'm so fucking down and i feel like  i'm in rock bottom  i don't even feel like picking up my own team and start it i'm just way too tired and lazy for that 

my future is uncertain i don't even know what he fuck i'd do  i badly need money to move out and have a good life  considering my degree it takes a lot of time to settle down and earn well  thinking all about this uncertainty gives me great anxiety  i am familiar with the stoic quotes that if you do not have control over something, do not worry about it and all that stuff but it just gives me temporary relief to a permanent problem 

i always feel like i'm having trust issues with everyone  i broke up with my girlfriend last year and i used to be the guy who's always surrounded by friends and popular but now all i want to be is alone and i keep pushing people away from my life  i want to deal with this anxiety alone because every person i have trusted has ended up betraying me or using my weaknesses to their advantage  idk if i'm overreacting but it sucks and i have lost faith in trusting people  it's like if someone does something to me it's not even bothering me and it seems like i saw it coming  now this pandemic has made me feel more anxious and uncertain  now the online classes have improved, moots have been conducted online but i still don't have the force to try it online since i find it super lame to argue online (maybe i am giving reasons for my laziness) but the friend who a abandoned me told the same reason and now he is doing it with another team  it seems like everything is going to be online for a few months so i should get used to all the stuff to be done online  i don't feel like doing it  
at home, i'm pressurized by my dad to help him with his work and he would threaten me that if i'm not of any use for him, he would stop helping me or pay for my college  at the other hand, i have not been listening to college classes, not participating in anything related to college work  all i'm doing is surf through reddit and also learn random stuff on mental health and psychology which is not even related to my studies   i hit the gym and maintain a decent body which is the only reason i could have a little self worth  i have no great hobbies to look upon since my school days my dad did not join me in any extracurricular activities as he was not ready to pay extra for it  he says paying for the education, giving food itself is a huge favour for me  

sorry for this rant  i feel like i don't know what i'm doing with my life  every external happening is deteriorating my mental health  i am very anxious about my uncertain future   i don't know what to do please help me out  is there anyone going through my phase?"

1,"stoic viewpoint on ripping off the band aid? in life i am coming across things that make me ponder the question, is it better to hold off on solving potential future problems, or give effort immediately to save future stress?

 amp  x200b 

for example i have been in a long term relationship (5 years), but it is now emerging that where we want to be in the next 2 10 years does not cleanly intertwine  but the problem is that right now, things aren't bad at all in the relationship and we share values and a good connection where i could see things working out perfectly 15 years down the road and it is very easy to let things coast by  the seneca quote ""he suffers more than necessary, suffers before it is necessary "" makes me think that maybe i should continue to let things coast on and see if either of our future desires change so that we would benefit from sticking together, and toughing it out in the middle if necessary  things are fine for now, but while we wait to possibly go our separate ways we would only get more attached, or start more issues  this brings up the (non stoic but i think still powerful ) quote by psychologist jordan peterson ""if you have to fight a dragon, you should go to its lair before it comes to your village "" right now trying to ignore a potential future issue would save a lot of stress, but dealing with it now could save even more stress in the future 

i guess the tldr version is for possible future emotional hinderances, do you deal with them at first sign, or let them possibly develop into a bigger problem at the hope they go away?"

 gt men seek retreats for themselves, houses in the country, sea shores, and mountains  and thou too art wont to desire such things very much  but this is altogether a mark of the most common sort of men, for it is in thy power whenever thou shalt choose to retire into thyself  for nowhere either with more quiet or more freedom from trouble does a man retire than into his own soul, particularly when he has within him such thoughts that by looking into them he is immediately in perfect tranquility  and i affirm that tranquility is nothing else than the good ordering of the mind  constantly then give to thyself this retreat, and renew thyself  and let thy principles be brief and fundamental, which, as soon as thou shalt recur to them, will be sufficient to cleanse the soul completely, and to send thee back free from all discontent with the things to which thou returnest  for with what art thou discontented? with the badness of men? recall to thy mind this conclusion, that rational animals exist for one another, and that to endure is a part of justice, and that men do wrong involuntarily  and consider how many already, after mutual enmity, suspicion, hatred, and fighting, have been stretched dead, reduced to ashes  and be quiet at last   but perhaps thou art dissatisfied with that which is assigned to thee out of the universe   recall to thy recollection this alternative  either there is providence or atoms, fortuitous concurrence of things  or remember the arguments by which it has been proved that the world is a kind of political community, and be quiet at last   but perhaps corporeal things will still fasten upon thee   consider then further that the mind mingles not with the breath, whether moving gently or violently, when it has once drawn itself apart and discovered its own power, and think also of all that thou hast heard and assented to about pain and pleasure, and be quiet at last   but perhaps the desire of the thing called fame will torment thee   see how soon everything is forgotten, and look at the chaos of infinite time on each side of the present, and the emptiness of applause, and the changeableness and want of judgement in those who pretend to give praise, and the narrowness of the space within which it is circumscribed, and be quiet at last  for the whole earth is a point, and how small a nook in it is this thy dwelling, and how few are there in it, and what kind of people are they who will praise thee

1,"how did you fing stoicism? this is a genuine question, we are over 300 thousands people on this subreddit and i'm curious how did you find stoicism  first let me tell my story 

it was about two years ago, when a girl rejected me  i felt awful  she didn't care about me afterwards at all  for weeks, i was just worrying about the whole situation, on how i messed up, etc  after a few weeks, i decided to just simply not care  i mean, if she didn't care about me, why would i? and thus, i started not caring about things i couldn't influence  i kind of ""created stoicism in myself""  even though she rejected me, after me realizing i shouldn't care, it was my best few months in my life  i was so happy, relaxed and i could focus on myself and other important things more then before  i realized how i wasted my time ""chasing"" her, and how much better i could've spent it 

this is due to convergent evolution, it means that species (or people) in the same environment develop the same traits  i believe this is how most people became stoic, they decided not to care about something 

however, at this point, i still didn't know about stoicism as a philosophy  but one day i was scrolling through youtube, when i saw a video thumbnail  ""the philosophy of not caring"", and the title was something about stoicism  i did not watch the video right away, but i searched stoicism in google to read a bit about it  and i instantly became obsessed with the philosophy

consider the last time you really worried or stressed about something, be it in the past, present, or future  consider all the energy and emotion that went into trying to change it  did you see any fruit for your efforts? if you did, good, we'll talk about that a little later  more often than not, however, you will see your efforts and emotional energy worrying or stressing about something you do not control go to waste, or at least most of it  now think about how much more calm, composed, and dare i say happy had you foregone the struggle and loved the fate you were given  think about what good that energy could've done had it been directed into something you  do  control, like your attitude, or your choice 

this is not to say that we do not try to effect our surroundings, or that we are powerless to change anything so, why bother? this is not stoicism, that's fatalism  study your hardest for that test, work your ass off for that promotion, spend hours a day exercising to achieve that body you want, these are all applaudable, so long as you understand the previous paragraph  nothing in the future is guaranteed  to paraphrase one of my favorite passages of enchiridion, 29, ""in the pursuit of an olympic gold medal in athletics you may give yourself over completely to your trainer, eating and sleeping only what and when he tells you to, you must submit to rules, abstain from luxuries, and ignore your friends  and, after having done all this, the day before the event you may fall into a ditch, dislocate your arm, turn your ankle or otherwise lose the victory "" was all that effort still worth it?   only you can decide that for yourself   

once we accept that we do not control reality and learn to just roll with it, life becomes infinitely easier  because i've accepted that i may never get that promotion, i work even harder at my job because the stress of ""am i doing everything right?"" is gone  because i've accepted that my loved ones may be gone tomorrow, i can maximize my time with them today, and spend it better  because i've accepted that i may never have that ripped athletic body i want, i am happier with progress i have actually made  

cheers 

tl dr  your drive, your ambitions, your efforts, these are all in your control  but do not assume that you can use them to change what is not in your control "
1,"is there anything un stoic or (anti stoic) about constantly posting stoic aphorisms on social media? not trolling here  it just really seems that an aspiring stoic would work on practicing a stoic attitude and developing a stoic mindset for herself or himself  after all, the realm of control starts and ends there "

1,"is this logos? sometimes i look at external, seemingly irrational things through the lens of natural selection  this view is the result of the rules for rulers video by cgp grey, the story about abraham wald with the armored planes, and of course darwin's theory of evolution  when i look at a lot of the things that would upset me with this lens, things stop upsetting me  i see reason in every action, and nothing feels personal, from global politics to micro transactions in video games "
1,"how to find a balance between being social and talking only what is necessary dear stoic friends, 

i have been learning and applying stoic principles every single day for about a year now and my life has improved dramatically ever since  however, one of the teachings i seem to fail the most is 

  let silence be your goal for the most part  say only what is necessary, and be brief about it  on the rare occasions when you re called upon to speak, then speak, but never about banalities like gladiators, horses, sports, food, and drink common place stuff          epictetus  

i consider myself an extrovert and sometimes i feel the need to fill the silence gaps with things that really don't matter a lot for the most part  

i wanted to find a way where the conversation wouldn't end, especially when talking to someone that i have just met but at the same time, i don't need to say things about myself   because every time i have nothing to say i end up talking about myself too much and it honestly bothers me when i do so, it is unnecessary and egocentric and no one cares about my life, accomplishments or goals if they did not ask so "
1,"people who have came close to dying, what were your  last  thoughts? "
1,"how to fully realize death? i know that someday i am going to die, and many others like friends, family and pets  but even when i visualize death of myself or someone else it doesn't really register, i still live life as normal, nothing changed  i don't fully realize death, it doesn't register in my unconscious 

how do i fully realize i and many others close to me are going to die?"
1,stoicism and self improvement i have just recently started practicing stoicism   currently reading the mediations  of ma  i have been trying to be a better person for last couple of years  just curious about the stoic's view on self improvement   like workout and just overall improvement in different aspects of life  
1,"should i go cold turkey on entertainment to prove myself that i am not addicted to them? just started to apply stoicism in my life and it kind of seems like i am addicted to entertainment like movies, anime, tv shows, and video games  so should i just stop doing those stuff for some time or is it fine if i just reduce the time i spend on them?

and if i were to stop, how long should i be not consuming them? is a week too less?"

1,"anxiety i have trouble rationalising with my anxiety  

i drove for the first time yesterday around my area, was quite nervous but did fine and once i was going i calmed down and felt better  i also drove today this time i went to the shopping centre  i was nervous about parking and managing in confined spaces, which i ended up doing fine  once i got going i felt better but i was still a little nervous  but beforehand i was really nervous and picturing myself making errors like hitting a gutter something  i ended up accidentally running over m the gutter a little and my boot flung open  i had to quickly find somewhere to pull over and fix it  luckily, there were no damages done to my car  i felt a little embarrassed before remaining myself,  i cannot control the opinions others may have, and if people can bother they will soon forget  the situation is over and i can move on now   

so, before i left my thoughts said,  what if something goes wrong? what if i hit somebody or something   i tried to reply,  i ve driven a long time and i always do fine  i m just underestimating myself  these images are only impressions and in fact reality   however, it turns it i did make an error by running over the gutter a bit as i was exiting the shopping centre which i did not see  

next time, how could i have handled my anxiety better?"
